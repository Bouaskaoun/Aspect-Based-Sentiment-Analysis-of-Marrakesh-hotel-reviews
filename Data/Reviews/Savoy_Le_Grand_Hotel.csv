Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Peter & Kay T wrote a review Mar 21,10,Unexpected Arrival,This was meant to be a celebration holiday - BA booked holiday -hotel said no room available blamed BA for no confirmation later transpired it was the hotels fault reception was both unhelpful & with attitude problems - totally unacceptable in my view especially late at night - My son in the UK contacted BA the following morning to sort the problem out as the hotel staff would do nothing to resolve the problem - it was eventually sorted out later that morning by my son & British Airways    The temporary overnight stay in a room provided by the hotel had to be covered by a holding debit card,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Horsham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/659petert
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Katia B wrote a review Mar 19,10,Dishonesty,I was there on a business trip of my husband. I left a gold necklace behind and I knew exactly where. After many calls they told me it was found but I could never get an answer to my emails or whatsapp where I gave my address to have it sent at my home. 4 weeks later I have not got it back. This is dishonesty! The vale of the necklace is not great but it is especially the moral aspect of the whole business.,Date of stay: February 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Amersfoort, The Netherlands",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/967katiab

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Mubeen F wrote a review Mar 12,50,Great Stay!!,Recently stayed at the Savoy Le Grand with my wife. Hotel is in a fantastic location. Which is approximately 1 hour drive from Atlas mountains. The staff are absolutely fantastic  Imad serves the best morrocoan tea all day in the lobby for free. Hafiza at breakfast makes amazing fresh paratha's called msemmen. Soukina and Ehsaan at the front desk are extremely helpful when you require assistance. The hotel is connected to Minara Mall which has alot of places for kids to eat on the roof top terrace including burger King. The hotel is 5 minutes away from M Avenue Nobu and So lounge for Shisha lovers.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Rakerone wrote a review Mar 11,50,Excellent hotel with attentive staff.,The Hotel was a great location for us. Only a couple of minutes taxi ride to the Souks Palace and Gardens which we visited. You could also walk and the path ways are beautiful and very accessible and flat. Very close to the airport and a taxi can be easily taken for around 10-15 pounds each way.    The breakfast was brilliant a large selection very good coffee fresh fruit and drinks omelettes crepes and other freshly made foods. The service was excellent. Certainly 5 stars for breakfast and service.    The staff were very helpful the front entrance is manned extremely well and taxis can be taken very easily. Anything you want they were attentive to help.    The pool areas are immaculate and sun beds were always available. We enjoyed the beach type shallow end for our toddler who loved it. The water is cold but when the temperature got to 34 you were pleased of it and the water warmed up. The pool food was very good and we enjoyed the restaurants too fresh smoothies very nice!    We ate at the restaurants and thought the food was of high quality lovely singer in the evening. If I was being critical the service was a little slow for one of the evenings and the restaurant staff weren’t as attentive as the breakfast and front of house.    Finally the Room  we had a lovely room and the bed was very comfortable shower amazing and all in all a very nice room. If anything would take this down to a 4 star rating would be some of the traffic noice when we booked a garden view room and the mini fridge going crazy for 20 minutes early in the morning. We didn’t ask to change room as we were settled and didn’t mind the street view too much and was contextual to what we paid. For a quieter room it would be worth booking an inward facing room pool or ensuring a garden view.    Thank you all at the hotel we would certainly return.,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, England, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rakerone

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Eric S wrote a review Feb 2023,30,Needing of an upgrade,Hotel is very decent however it's in bad need of an upgrade    1) Sheets/linens are poor quality. How can you make a king bed with linens of 2 fulls? How can you not have king sheets/comforters?  2) How can you made beds with linens that are so old? How much could it cost to provide decent linens?  3) Service is poor. Everything you have to ask 4 times before it gets done. You call they say ok and never show up. Even the most basic things are a task  4) Muad the manager was the only one who was helpful  5) breakfast was very good  6) I could write many more issues but it's not worth it    Strongly suggest you find a hotel or Riad that has more of a local flavor,Date of stay: January 2023,,"Brooklyn, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O6049YDerics
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Daanyal A wrote a review Jan 2023,50,Outstanding service,Aissam on the concierge desk was outstanding. The most professional efficient and courteous individual - by far we received the best customer service from him.  The service he provided was better than what we received at Four Seasons. Definitely staying here again. Excellent location & great hotel. Once again Aissam was the star at this hotel and deserves all the accolades. Aissam was able to make the most professional bookings for restaurants activities and entertainment at short notice. His network with all other 5 star hotels is exceptionally tight.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,stcello1 wrote a review Jan 2023,50,Amazing winter sun venue - Marrahech and Savoy Le Grand Hotel,We had four lovely winter days in Marrakech and the surrounding area based at the Savoy Le Grand Hotel which is beautiful comfortable and in an ideal location. The bars restaurants and pools in the hotel are lovely and all well maintained and clean. The location is possibly the best thing about it. It is very close to the centre and literally attached to a shopping mall with a supermarket and a good selection of cafes and shops and just beyond the mall are a number of very good restaurants. We tried two of them a Lebanese restaurant on the same side of the road as the mall and a French place called Le Six (sign says Le 6) across the road. Both were very good. We also used Anas a local guide to get us around the city and into the desert and mountains. Great guy very knowledgeable and good English (+212 687 148556). We spent the first two days seeing as many of the sights as we could with Anas and then relaxed at the hotel for the last two days of our stay enjoying the sunshine. It got up to 21C between around noon and 5pm and when the sun went down below the level of the hotel we could have another hour on the balcony of our rooms in the sun. For a family from Scotland 21C was warm enough to get some colour into our pasty white legs. Hotel had some exceptional and helpful staff including Imad the dancing waiter who can perform a 360 degree pirouette as he pours your mint tea into a very small glass from a fully extended arm so liquid dropping two or three feet into the glass without a drop spilled. Morad the guest services advisor also seemed to pop up whenever some advice was needed. His English was so good we thought he might be English as he even had an East End twang in his accent - and he had lived there in the past.  Our flight home on evening of departure involved going to the airport at about 6pm and the hotel gave us a free late check-out for both rooms until 2:30 which was appreciated.  To summarise great hotel great location fantastic city amazing weather in our winter. Highly recommend.  One little note of advice to hotel: communication before we arrived was poor - I sent four messages via email and their own contact board online but never got a response however nothing was too much trouble when we got there.  Last word of advice to travellers who haven't been: even without hold luggage you need at least two hours at the airport. You need to queue with those who have cases to hand over to get your boarding pass stamped before you can go through security; the security queues were long and took some time; and when you get through there you have a third long queue to negotiate for passport control. Finally once you go through security you can't pay at cafes with a card so need some local currency for your final coffees before heading home.,Date of stay: January 2023,,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stcello1
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,kpnuts12 wrote a review Jan 2023,20,Poor customer service,Stayed 7 nights location excellent supermarket in shopping mall restaurants however restaurants don’t sell alcohol. Found M Avenue near by with new hotel (wished we stayed there at same price) restaurants an amazing Tapas cocktail bar an luxury shopping.    The hotel however was very disappointing firstly arranged airport transfer no one was there when we arrived had to chase this up. Very apologetic which was nice.    Concierge were amazing friendly and helpful throughout our stay sorry didn’t remember names.    We went to our room which was the prestige 2 bedroom suite which I believe is meant to be best room. I must say it was very clean and on first look was very impressive. Unfortunately the curtains in main bedroom were hanging off the rail so couldn’t be pulled allowing light in. I reported to reception but no one came to deal with the issue. When I checked door it was not locked this was broken so security risk especially as there is access from balcony which is shared with other rooms.    After long day we were looking forward to a good nights sleep this wasn’t to be they had music playing incredibly loud every night until 11.30 which was immediately under this room so if you have young children who need to sleep don’t stay in these rooms. There wasn’t actually anyone in bar area listening to music I’m sure in the summer this would be different.    Had shower in morning but this flooded the whole room I slipped fortunately I didn’t get badly injured but a little sore.    We reported these issues immediately and I must say they were resolved. The shower was simply down to not cleaning drainage area which should be done daily with the amount of use. This happened again on last day.    Cleaning when done was very good however I had to ask daily for our room to be cleaned didn’t happen otherwise.    Breakfast was an appalling experience service incredibly slow in fact one day I served the juice and laid our table! Apart from one day when it was very busy and we were sent to different breakfast area which was incredible same food but perfect service. Shame we only found this the last day.    Beware the security check your bags when coming into hotel an charge you a large amount to keep any alcohol you have purchased or take it from you. Felt like a criminal.    The spa is chargeable about £25 which I felt was expensive considering so small.    The bar area by pool had football on tv daily but when my sons asked to change to different football they refused even though the bar had no other guests in there. They also asked my sons to be tipped.    We put our complaints to guest relations manager who was perfectly friendly but did nothing to put things right despite promises did offer discount on next visit but as I pointed out this was no good to us as I wouldn’t be returning. He suggested I put up a review! Astonishing.    We asked to see a manager but that never materialised.    If you like very large impersonal hotels with a fantastic pool area an good location this may be a hotel for you. I imagine in the height of season this hotel will be very busy so service slower if that’s possible.    For us this hotel was far to big an impersonal much better options in Marrakesh.,Date of stay: December 2022,,"Salisbury, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kpnuts12
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Faisal A wrote a review Jan 2023,40,Good,What was amazing was the facilities that the hotel provided top quality pool and gym. The staff were really nice. The gym was decent and there was an amazing personal trainer called Jaouad who was really helpful kind and informative. Also the guest manager Mourad was absolutely hilarious and brilliant to meet. However the downside would be the room when it’s winter the AC in the rooms becomes a heater and the room was too hot even with nothing on.,Date of stay: December 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/faisalaO1348DJ

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,pstienstra wrote a review Dec 2022,20,Not for Moroccan married to foreigner,If you are married to a foreigner with foreigner marriage certificate save yourself the embarrassment and don’t go to this hotel because it is not valid. We made a reservation via hotel.com and we arrived there. They refused our stay by saying that the hotel rule is that we need to be married in Morocco with a Moroccan marriage certificate otherwise it is not valid. They were so rude and kept asking if I can speak to the manager the receptionist said no the manager is not there and it will take her a while to be back. So leaving the door man asked us what the reason for the quick in and out we told him and we said we couldn’t speak to the manager he said the manager is sitting there she was in the lobby all the time and the receptionist kept saying that we should just leave because the manager will be late.

However the morning of us getting to the airport at 830am they said they wouldn’t do transfers and no managers were available till 10 o clock. It was quite annoying then the taxi driver ripped us off as well as he knew we were desperate to get to the airport . Get everything in writing as they don’t stick to what they say they will do.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Fidelscastrol wrote a review Nov 2022,40,Not The Savoy in London quality but still great.,If you are expecting Savoy London or La Mamounia Marrakech then you need a fistful of more dollars. This hotel is great though. I loved the area around the pool. Very clean and gardens nice and well maintained. Breakfast and restaurants here great. Good food choices and service. The room overlooking the back gardens was quieter than those facing the main pool. The main pool was very clean probably due to being very chilly as late November. There was an indoor pool that looked inviting. Great screens indoor and outdoor to watch the World Cup football with English commentary. Our first visit to Morocco and this hotel and in particular it's location in Hivernage ensured we were very happy.

We made a reservation via hotel.com and we arrived there. They refused our stay by saying that the hotel rule is that we need to be married in Morocco with a Moroccan marriage certificate otherwise it is not valid. They were so rude and kept asking if I can speak to the manager the receptionist said no the manager is not there and it will take her a while to be back. So leaving the door man asked us what the reason for the quick in and out we told him and we said we couldn’t speak to the manager he said the manager is sitting there she was in the lobby all the time and the receptionist kept saying that we should just leave because the manager will be late.

However the morning of us getting to the airport at 830am they said they wouldn’t do transfers and no managers were available till 10 o clock. It was quite annoying then the taxi driver ripped us off as well as he knew we were desperate to get to the airport . Get everything in writing as they don’t stick to what they say they will do.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Fidelscastrol wrote a review Nov 2022,40,Not The Savoy in London quality but still great.,If you are expecting Savoy London or La Mamounia Marrakech then you need a fistful of more dollars. This hotel is great though. I loved the area around the pool. Very clean and gardens nice and well maintained. Breakfast and restaurants here great. Good food choices and service. The room overlooking the back gardens was quieter than those facing the main pool. The main pool was very clean probably due to being very chilly as late November. There was an indoor pool that looked inviting. Great screens indoor and outdoor to watch the World Cup football with English commentary. Our first visit to Morocco and this hotel and in particular it's location in Hivernage ensured we were very happy.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Honeypops1 wrote a review Jun 2022,50,Amazing holiday,After reading some of the reviews I was worried about staying in the hotel and as it’s our first time visiting Morocco we didn’t know what to expect.    The hotel staff couldn’t be more friendly and helpful we arrived on the early flight so our room wasn’t ready so I spoke to Fatima on reception and explained that we are only here for a few days and needed to change so we could enjoy the pool. She was very understanding and quickly moved us to another room that was ready.    Youssef was very helpful from taking our bags upto the room to making reservations in Bhuddha Bar and helping us with an excursion to the Atlas Mountains.    The pool was spotless the music was great. We got beds around the pool every day and the the staff from Rocky’s Bar ran around all day making sure everyone was happy.    The food in the hotel was very good and the breakfast was very nice with lots of choice.    The trip to the Atlas Mountains was amazing we booked everything though Mehdi the Concierge we had a great driver and Guide it was an amazing day but you need to take enough money for tips and to buy drinks and gifts even though lunch and the guide was included in the price of the excursion we were asked to pay this again when we were there which was disappointing as we would have given them a good tip anyway but it made us feel like we were being ripped off! As we were alone in the Atlas Mountains we felt vulnerable so we just paid what was asked. This was the only negative I can say about the trip and this is no reflection on the hotel.    Buddha bar is a must lovely food with an amazing show! we also went to Al Fassia which was a traditional Moroccan restaurant the food was nice with lovey staff and beautiful gardens.

Tired travellers just wanting a bed for the night. Le Savoy hotel is quite a large complex and rooms were probably furthest from reception. When we finally got to room the key card did not work. Concierge has to go all the way back to reception to get a new activated key card. When concierge came back key card did not work. I goes back to reception to figure out why card not working. Each time taking 25 mins. When concierge finally arrived back to the allocated room the reason for the key card not working was because the hotel receptionist had 'confused' his number 3's with his number 4's!!! 3314 v 3414. Whole episode was farcical. Would have a better nights sleep sleeping on a sun lounger as bed was rock hard.

He is a real gem the kind you need when you’re in a foreign country. He got on so well with us very efficient and passionate towards his work. Very professional and friendly once again thank you so much Mr Mourad for all your friendly hellos and little conversations we had.    We would also want to thank Miss Yousra for going over and beyond to make sure we were happy and accommodating us she allowed us to oversee three different rooms and was very calm with our decision of us keep changing rooms however she was so efficient and to make sure we were happy and we are over thankful. Her smile was just amazing.    We would also like to thank Mr Essam at the concierge for Making sure all our needs were met. We were always certain he would meet our needs for reservations at all the places we needed to be.    Lastly I would like to thank Mr Reda during breakfast always ensuring I was satisfied and always knew that I wanted my tea he did all he could to make sure I was always happy!

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,MarSo68 wrote a review Jun 2022,20,A poorly managed 5 star hotel,We did not choose Savoy Le Grand Marrakech. It was indicated to us by my husband's company so we had to stay there. The very average reviews you read are actually accurate. This is a very poorly managed 5 star hotel and this was 100% reflected in our experience.  First of all we tried for 2 weeks to contact the hotel to ask for some clarifications. We sent emails wrote on social media but no response. We received a response via Messenger 2 weeks after we had returned from Morocco - about 4 weeks after we sent the messages!  Check in was bad. At the desk they told us that we had reserved a room for 1 person while our confirmation was for 2 adults. We did not like the room they gave us and when we called reception they told us they did not have any other rooms available on that day. We went to Reception in person they found another room for us and we moved on that same day. If they had told the truth on our first phone call we would not have taken stuff out and we would have been much happier.  The rooms are spacious but their cleanliness is average especially of things such as curtains and floors. I do not think that during our week stay they changed the sheets once. Each room has a small fridge and they give you 2 small bottles of water every day.  The breakfast variety is OK although irrespective of the time you visit the buffet all provisions are half empty. The breakfast waiting staff spends all their time talking to each other and they do not come to your table to serve you coffee or give you cutlery cups etc. We had to tip one waiter after a few days so that we get our coffee and get clean cutlery cups and napkins for our table. Nobody is supervising the breakfast at the hotel and the whole experience is a true disaster.  We did not have lunch or dinner - just a club sandwich at the swimming pool which was good.  Last thing I want to comment on is the furniture at breakfast and around the pools. 75% of all chairs have bird poop so if you decide to visit the hotel make sure where you sit!,Date of stay: May 2022,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Athens, Greece",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarSo68
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Experienced traveller wrote a review May 2022,40,Good hotel but too much music,Booked a suite very good  problem with door fixed immediately .house keeping excellent  service excellent  room excellent  cleanliness excellent . Pool excellent  but couldn’t find any pool toilets so had to go up to room bit of a pain. Felt very safe in hotel complex. Staff very friendly be aware they will Reseve 1000 dirhams per day of your stay when you check in  to cover any costs in the hotel.    Now downside  the pool area music played between 10-5/6 heavy beat music  couldn’t concentrate on book so loud or talk to each other.. The other problem was the restaurant by the pool was a floor below our room on an evening  couldn’t sleep until it finished at 11.30  and you had no chance of napping during the day .  Went to Buddha bar next to hotel to eat  126£ for 2 courses and soft drinks for 2  rip off  could even see show!  Don’t eatin Morrocan restaurant expensivish  but Mall plenty of restaurants and shops are good  Would definitely go back if they stopped the loud music or made it quieter so you can relax more . Trips are a rip off and you just get dragged into the guides friends shops !  Would go again to this hotel  just sort out the music  holidays are for relaxing !,Date of stay: May 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MAMAT1924

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Hasan wrote a review May 2022,50,Savoy le Grand Hotel Marrakech Stay,We visited Marrakech for a holiday hoping to relax by the pool but also experience the best that the city has to offer. We were really excited to stay at the Savoy and the hotel did not disappoint! The room was a very good size with a lovely bathroom and shower. All of the food in the different restaurants/bars was great and it was always a lovely atmosphere around the hotel.    We had not booked any excursions before we arrived but we had an idea about what we wanted to do. We discussed this with the concierge Aissam who was incredibly helpful. He planned an itinerary for the week booked the excursions for us and ensured we had an English speaking driver/guide for all of our trips (which were all private!). He was incredibly facilitating and welcoming making sure that we managed to do/visit everything we wanted to as well as feeling safe and looked after. He also had some great restaurant recommendations and even sorted out the bookings for these for us too. All we had to do was let Aissam know what we wanted to do and he got it done - we are very grateful for everything he did for us on this trip and I would highly recommend discussing anything you want to do during your stay with him!    The staff around the hotel were also fantastic. Special mention goes to Abdelkarim who made sure we had everything we needed whether this was at breakfast or by the pool. He was very polite and looked after us very well. Even though there were lots of people staying at the same time he made sure it felt like we had a personal service from him and was always available when we needed help with anything - thank you!    Overall we have had a great time at the Savoy and would highly recommend this. We look forward to coming here again!,Date of stay: May 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hasanmzi

After 7 months of not being able to go due to the Pandemic we finally were there at the beginning of May this year.  We are always welcomed by the staff who treat us like old friends particularly Morad customer relations manger and Kaoutar in the breakfast restaurant. In fact everyone is very friendly and accommodating.  Whilst were there this time it was our wedding anniversary. Morad surprised us with our room decorated with rose petals and hearts and champagne by the pool.    We only have one complaint.....the music round the swimming pool is much too loud. There is a quiet pool but we don't want to sit there.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Trevor H wrote a review May 2022,20,Absolutely not 5* and pray you don't have a medical emergency,This hotel is described at 5* it absolutely isn't. It's 4* at the very best.  Check-in was a bit slow as the other reviews have mentioned what I didn't appreciate was to be coughed all over by the receptionist who had a continuous cough and didn't bother to cover her mouth at all.  Once we got into the room and started unpacking we found the aircon fan is on the lowest/slowest setting and it will not move whatsoever from this setting.    My wife cut her foot on a shard of broken glass that was on the rug upon calling reception the couldn't grasp what had happened in the end I went down to reception and manged to get a first aid kit. The first aid kit not only had been opened and used with partially replenished items but what items were there are out of date by months. They say they've got a doctor onsite but I'm not so sure.  Seeing how the other guests behave I'm surprised we didn't get more cuts during the stay.    I read other reviews about thefts and whilst we didn't experience this ourselves I can see how they happen. Room doors are left open and there's countless guests/kids roaming the property going from room to room they can be in and out in seconds. Make sure the door is closed & the lock clicks. the door can be closed but if the lock doesn't click then it can be pushed open easily.    We only ate once at Alfredo's and the service was poor at best larger families who came in after us got served much quicker. We didn't bother trying the other restaurants after this for lunch or dinner.  Breakfast can only be described as chaotic with kids running round doing as they please. The breakfast food and service is good though.    If you want a quiet room then ask a room over looking the small swimming pool to the side there's no entertainment there and therefore no kids running round.    Food & drink can be smuggled in easily enough from the supermarket next door just make friends with security on the door first :)    I really cannot recommend this hotel as a couple family maybe but not as a couple.    Only take the lift don't use the stairs as there's plates & soiled beds in the hallways. I'm sure I saw a fire exit blocked by chairs too didn't have my phone with me to get a photo.    The room safe also ran out of batteries but to be fair they did send somone up quickly to replace them.,Date of stay: May 2022,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trevorhI702BH
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Jackie wrote a review May 2022,40,"Nice hotel, lacks a 5 star experience",Beautiful hotel excellent location. We had prestige room which was huge very clean lovely bedding and bed towels ace to! Good toiletries in room.  We over looked the quieter pool which was great.  Check in - Fatima was very efficient and professional although extremely busy and the reception seemed short staffed.  Breakfast - Aziz waitor excellent and very busy! Breakfast was also lovely and the crepes and Nutella really good. Huge selection of yogurts cheese ham pastries etc.  Pool - so many reserved sunbeds with no one on them. Lots of pool staff thay were attentive to many guests but also kids in adult only pool reserved sunbed issue seemed a pity rules not enforced. Some fab pool side seating available if you lucky! Bar service around pool are also slow sorry for the waitors doing this as they very busy hotel was busy and they probably need more staff.  Appeared to be lots of restaurants but we couldn't find menus or information easily. Reception told us it was on TV but we only found room service. Also this is a large hotel and there was no information on layout or where restaurants or pools were and although Reception were good they were very busy and we recieved no info.  We asked the concierge re airport transfer and were told no problem €30. Just to let others know this is extremely expensive and the hotel is around 7 mins from the airport! We booked independently with booking.com for €11. Obviously many hotel guests are very well off and the hotel transfer is not a cost issue!  Location next to the Menara mall and a carrefour supermarket also handy.  Overall a beautiful hotel and in a fab location but they didn't make us feel particularly welcome or looked after so it is not a whole 5 star experience you may expect from a Savoy hotel.,Date of stay: May 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Aberdeen, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mrsjb2010
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Lindsey P wrote a review May 2022,10,"Poor, poor, poor",Such a shame as I want to like this hotel. I’m here as writing this. I have moved rooms twice due to - air conditioning not working safe not working hair dryer not working….moved rooms to have the shower flood the whole room. (Bad luck I guess) then come back to room on day 2 at 4.30 pm to no-one cleaning the room. (Another disappointment)  Pool bar is a bar that never want to serve you dispute having loads of people around. Day one…they said I couldn’t have a drink as they hadn’t pre-authorised my account….then conceirge stepped in to say please serve them which the boy behind the pool bar took great delight to say we are closed now 🙈. I would say I can list all the poor service we have had but I would be here forever.  This is a hotel that I would never come to I would pay extra happily to the Sofitel or a park bench.  There isn’t any point trying to tell a manager because they simply don’t care. It’s a hotel that doesn’t want to give any service or take any money of you.  Very pedestrian in everything is does.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,JennFr wrote a review May 2022,20,Sadly not 5 star (3 maybe…),We were so excited to visit Marrakesh we booked with British Airways holidays for a visit to the Savoy Le grand hotel….    Check in was speedy and the lady at reception checked us in at 8am which was great as we were tired from an early flight. However it was mostly down hill from there…    - the hotel in general is so so tired the walls are paper thin rooms smell of smoke there’s holes in the curtains lights are twisted and broken.  - breakfast time is chaos and for three days we were unable to get a drink with our breakfast. If you have fried eggs they will be likely be clear and raw…  - getting lunch here is equally as difficult we waited an hour just for an orange juice.  - I cannot be sure it was the hotel food however we also both had food poisoning and had to spend a day of our holiday in bed feeling rather ill.  - there was a lot of left over room service food on the stairs and the hallways throughout the day which wasn’t pleasant to see or smell.  - shower gels and soap were replaced every day when only used once which was so wasteful.  - everywhere looks like it needs a really good clean  - bed creaky and uncomfortable    Food:    The hotel will recommend the “best restaurants in Marrakesh” from a list. Funnily enough three of these happen to be part of the hotel and the others are over priced tourist traps.    After trying a couple of the “recommendations” we did some research and found these gems:    We really enjoyed Azar (we went three times) and every time it was fabulous. Great atmosphere delicious food and lovely staff. We’re not fussed on shows ourself but there was also belly dancing from 9pm.    We also enjoyed Al Fassia cooked only by Moroccan ladies quieter atmosphere but delicious food.    Comptoir Darna also had great reviews but we sadly couldn’t get a reservation as it was too busy.    Special thanks to:    The concierge Aissam as he is very overloaded but managed to get us a reservation when we needed one and also told us about the taxis and crafty old town locals (read below). Super helpful - thank you!    Mohammed looking after breakfast and lunch. Absolutely trying his heart out and always smiling but unfortunately there is a massive lack of organisation in general.    Transport:    Taxis to the new town and old town should only cost you 50 MAD always agree a price before you get in the taxi and have the exact money. They will not give you charge if you give them a 100 MAD note and will try to charge you silly amounts for a 5 minute journey. If you speak French to them they are also quite crafty and will then change to Arabic so you can’t understand them.    Most of them drive like maniacs and there’s no seatbelts so be careful.    The hotel concierge said to take pictures of the number plates and if they do take more money than agreed from you they will see that they’re told off.    Old town:    Be very careful who you speak to and with prices of items. It’s so easy to get swindled and they’re very good at it.    You’ll find locals seem very helpful offering directions however you’ll soon find you’ve walked 10 minutes towards one of their shops/stalls away from your original destination. This happens a lot hear the saadian tombs and palaces. Use google maps and don’t listen to them.    New town:    Not too much here other than the odd good restaurant so if you’re after culture stick with the old town.    YSL Museum was disappointing but good for any Instagramers.    Go for a coffee to the royal mansour a short walk away and be amazed.    Go on a day trip to the Atlas Mountains!    …sorry I wouldn’t recommend this hotel. It’s no where near a 5 star and we were shocked by people who said they loved it.

It is a beautiful hotel lovely big pool and we had a fabulous suite with 2 bedrooms a living room and 3 bathrooms! Our balcony looked onto the pool and we could see the Atlas mountains in the distance. The location of the hotel was great joined onto the Menara mall and a walkable distance to the main square and medina. We loved the hotel breakfast: the kids loved the crêpe bar and my husband loved the omelette bar. The service at the pool was excellent we ordered cocktails and lunch every day. Our only issue with the hotel is that the pool was being cleaned every day until 11am. So we had to wait for this to finish before we could go in. It was nice to see the thorough cleaning process but this should’ve started earlier and been finished by 9am. We loved the pool and were in every day. They also had an indoor pool which we used on our first few days when the weather was a bit overcast.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Sara Hession wrote a review Apr 2022,50,Amazing stay thanks to the Staff,I highly recommend Savoy Le Grand Hotel I stayed with my daughter for 5 days. the hotel is central location very close to the airport and the city with all its attractions. The physical built and the furniture is to a very high standards. It is well maintained and the Staff are amazing. They always go the extra mile as they did their best to make us feel comfortable and welcomed.    Our flight arrived early and we were so exhausted from the 6 o'clock morning flight arriving from Edinburgh. The check in time was at after 02.00 I think 03.00 PM . But Murrad; The reservation manager arranged to gave us the room some time after 12.00. and when I checked out for my late flight he also let us do a little later check out. He even kept checking on us each time we met at the reception area asking if every thing was OK and or if we need anything extra.    Issam from concierge facilitated our transportation from and to the airport . He actually arrange booking for us in MALAK restaurant and it was an dinner from dreams. He also arranged our trip to the desert. His recommendations were always right on the spot and he was professional kind and very punctual.    My teenager daughter had to set a french test online and she left her text book back home :( in Scotland. Her friend send her an image of the texts she would have exam on and Shaimaa from the Bar arrange to print and rewrite the unclear text for us with the help from the office I think her name was FatimaAlzahraa. My daughter passed her test!    As for the breakfast Murrad  Kawthar Fatima Alzahraa always helped me. They prepared plate for my daughter with her favorit food and kept it on my table for her because she a late morning riser. Even that lady who did the baking of the morning MESAMEN...

Special shout out to Youssra and Soukaina who made sure that the stay was a pleasant one.    Air conditioning can be improved though. It is all central which means that if you wanted air conditioning in March you won't get it as they still only offered heating only.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Urfan A wrote a review Mar 2022,20,2 STAR SERVICE IN 5 STAR HOTEL,Unfortunately could have been so much better if my wife’s belongings didn’t go missing on the first day which was a very bad start. We made a complaint to the reception which then management said they were going to investigate. Miraculously only partial things then turned up in our room 2 days later. We constantly had to ask for slippers toothpaste and extra towels to be given in which was supposed to be a 5 star hotel but was in fact 2 star service. On check out the customer Liason officer apologised and wanted us to meet the cleaning lady so that she could clarify but unfortunately was too late for apologies and clarification then as walked out of the door got questioned about some towels that may have gone missing from the room ( I mean seriously) we offered for her to check our luggage which she declined only positive experience was the service the concierge provided Thanks to Aissam he guided and arranged 3 separate events for us which was fantastic experience he made the bookings for us and arranged taxi pick up and return which made it so very easy for us. If only the Savoy le Grand hotel had more staff like Aissam they would do so much better.,Date of stay: March 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/748urfana

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Anam Asad wrote a review Dec 2021,50,Mesmerizingly beautiful experience !,Me and my husband booked Savoy Le grand for our honeymoon in july. We stayed there for 10 nights. The whole experience from the first day to last day was an unforgetable journey for us. We were provided with the best customer service we can not forget. We were warmed welcome from each and every staff member of the hotel especially Mehdi Murad and Aiysam. We planned our every day with Mehdi and he provided us 'the absolutely best' of everything. All of these three men recommended us the best resturaunts and we luckily had time to try all of those. Munir and Ilyas drove us to beautiful places like Atlas moutains and Agadir beach.  one thing I can name is the breakfast of the hotel with a range variety of fresh items one can never get bore we miss especially the nutella crepes everyone should try them. The pools were excellent very clean and great enviroment (with dj).  In short we had a 10/10 experience and we highly recommend it to anyone visitng Marrakech who is looking for an excellent time.

If we have one complaint it's the loud music round the magnificent pool. We have mentioned it before.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,esh007786 wrote a review Aug 2021,50,5*****,Where do I start?? This hotel was probably the best hotel we have ever stayed at during our global vacations. The service was impeccable the staff were fantastic and they made sure our stay was memorable.    The hotel is located right next to menara mall which is one of the main spots in Marrakech. Having the mall entrance within the hotel compound also helped escape the extreme heat so we used to go there a few times for lunch.    The outdoor pool was fantastic. Great size and the atmosphere was always electric. The live music and the ambience throughout was out of this world. The pool menus were also lovely we ordered food and drinks many times and they were always fresh and tasty.    The room suite we had was lovely. Balcony had ample space with great views of the pool so you never felt like you were missing out! Jacuzzi in the bathroom was also a treat and went down well especially after a long day in the sun!    The spa and jacuzzi area was amazing. Great vibes there lovely relaxing music and I felt very relaxed.    A special shout out to Kautar in the breakfast lounge she was amazing always went out her way for us and ensured we had the most impressive breakfast every day!    Kamal the pool staff was amazing. Always checked in with us to make sure we had what we wanted and looked after us very well.    Murad the lobby staff also was brilliant. Very thoughtful caring and I loved his English which always put a smile on my face and the kids really loved interacting with him!    Otman the lobby staff always greeted us warmly making sure our taxis were prompt and went out his way all the time.    Ridwan the chief security officer with his Million dollar smile! Always made sure we were safe and that we had what we wanted.

Wrong decision ever as a hotelier talking  you should be ashamed of the service you provide. No hotel orientation by the receptionist. Staff are careless and they are not careful to details at all also they have a huge miscommunication between each other  AC is not working at all even tho you call for maintenance nobody cares .. we ordered from Room service it took ages for the food to arrive and when it arrived there was no cutlery neither sauces or atleast a simple tobasco.. Housekeeping staff should have a training on how to smile with guests bcuz they dont know what that word means plus they didn’t change our towels neither refilling the complimentary water bottles until we requested for. The room keys have no proper key jackets and they were handed over in an envelope which is a big nooo (envelopes are for bills ) plus the keys keep on deactivating alone .. There was no waiters in the pool area we had to go find them ourselves and the terrible part is that we were informed that pool closes at 8pm and one of the staff came at 7:15pm to remove the towels which is super inappropriate..

The hotel is located near 3 night clubs a mall and a few restaurants which help if you have a long day and want to hang out locally. Hamza in the breakfast staff was very helpful and accommodating. His daily attention provided for five star treatment that everyone looks for when on vacation. Morad was another very helpful staff member when we were delayed due to the COVID outbreak he arranged a car to take us to another city so that we could catch a flight back to the US.

What stood out the most however was the exceptional service we received from every single staff member. I would like to highlight one staff member in particular . . . Abdel Ilah. My youngest daughter woke up at midnight with a severe ear infection. I was in a panic as we were set to fly back to Canada at 10am. I knew I needed to get her medical attention and raced down to the lobby where Abdel was the concierge on duty. He was incredibly helpful kind and compassionate and had me in a cab with my daughter heading to the International Clinic quickly. We received great care at the clinic and Abdel was at the front entrance when we returned to the hotel. He had even called the clinic earlier to check in on my daughter and make sure she was ok. I have shared our experience at the Marrakech Savoy with many people . . . I am so grateful for the kindness and care Abdel extended to us that night.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,FamuBusinessReisen wrote a review Mar 2020,40,Great place to be,We stayed here as a family for one week and really enjoyed it. Deluxe Rooms with living room are wonderful and spaceous. Room service was perfect. Nice outdoor pool huge indoor pool rather dark but okay.  Breakfast room is very noisy and overcrowded not a 5 star level at all. Missing service strategy of breakfast director!  Nevertheless there are very ambitious and friendly service people especially Elmehdi who did. an excellent job within the daily breakfast chaos.  Having the shopping centre next to the hotel was very convenient.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,HSerraj wrote a review Feb 2020,10,5-star price for a 1-star experience,Take your money elsewhere. Came here with my childhood friends 3 girlfriends excited to spend time together sans husbands and kids boy how disappointed are we.  1. Booked a suite with a special request for 3 beds. When we arrived the room had a double bedroom and not prepared for 3 people. Had to go back to reception because we kept getting the phone hung up on us.  2. The receptionists are rude: the excuse is that they do not see the special requests from booking.com which is a bs.  3. For the extra bed it is of a kid's size. An adult doesn't fit in these beds. We complained again the answer: 'this is the only thing we have'  4. The waiting stuff at the pool doesn't seem interested in serving. We had to get the menu ourselves  5. We had to ask for extra towels and for bath robes. It took a while to settle in the room  In summary I am flabbergasted with the mediocrity. The only good mention is to Mehdi the guest relations manager who means well and tries to help but can't do much as the hotel doesn't offer the minimal level expected of a 5-star hotel,Date of stay: February 2020,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Frankfurt, Germany",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HSerraj
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Terryturf wrote a review Feb 2020,10,Refused Entry with my Wife on Honeymoon !!!,Please look for more accomodating hotels with friendlier less arrogant reception staff.  If my review helps at least one couple avoid the upset and total humiliation myself and my wife suffered at this place it will be worth my time.  We had a friend ring ahead to check the protocol regarding staying here as newlyweds.  To avoid any confusion we took along our marriage certificate issued on saturday in spain.  Non the less they told us we were not permitted to stay together on our honeymoon! And we must book 2 separate rooms . Taking legal advice from the Notary at the Morrocan Consulate in Algeciras the Hotel were completely wrong and should have accepted our paperwork . Maybe for a 5 star hotel they should be a bit more clued up on their own laws if they want to follow the rules so strictly  We refused obviously .

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,35tia wrote a review Feb 2020,10,Not 5 star service,The buildings and general look of the hotel is good as is the location.  However the service is poor inattentive and certainly not 5 star.  The cleaners housekeeping and reception staff are not at all bothered about the standard of service they provide and there a major issues with cleanliness and communications.  The breakfast staff are also slow and do not understand even basic concepts of customer service. On 2 days out of a 1 week stay our hot drinks only arrived after several reminders and a 25 minute delay.  The reception staff are too slow and have little idea about how to run a hotel efficiently.  The outdoor pool was never heated up - always remained cold- in a true 5 star hotel this would have been addressed.  The saving grace of the hotel is the concierge - Mehdi and his team. They were excellent.  Everything else was sub-par and deeply disappointing.,Date of stay: February 2020,,"Cheshire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/35tia

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,YasminL92 wrote a review Feb 2020,50,A perfect holiday,A must read if you are picky about your hotels (as I am) Myself and my partner are currently enjoying our last couple of days of our ‘babymoon’ holiday and what a blast we have had. As I am 5 months pregnant we decided to go for a hotel where we can relax and soak up the sun during the day and then enjoy the chaos of Marrakesh on an evening and the savoy was perfect for many reasons. Upon arrival there was no queue we were welcomed by numerous members of staff and check in was stress free. The room was ready for us and we were given a lovely free upgrade to a pool view room. We were shown to our room by Jamal who is an absolute sweetheart he kindly gave us his number and was on hand (even on his days off) to give us recommendations on where to eat and things to do and see in Marrakesh. The room was huge and spotless and the bathroom was sparkling clean. Everyday the maids would clean make up the bed supply clean towel and robes shower gels and creams and left us petals on our bed for valentines day which was a lovely little surprise.  There’s plenty of sun beds at both pool areas and no matter where you were you caught sun. The main pool area is lively with music playing everyday and waiters on hand to supply you with food and drink and the other at the back is quiet and peaceful so you have the best of both worlds. Abdelkarim served us most days and he was super efficient and very kind to us always very welcoming and a lovely chap. Only downfall for the pool area - the pool is FREEZING however we found this quite refreshing and had a giggle every 10 minutes when we had to get in to cool off. The pool is most definitely the cleanest I have ever experienced (and we travel a lot). Every night and morning the pool was thoroughly cleaned the floor was literally scrubbed and the pool beds were wiped down. I’ve never experienced this in another hotel.  Breakfast cannot be faulted. All of the waiters and waitresses are a credit to the hotel very efficient in sitting you down and getting tea coffee and fresh orange to you asap. There’s a wide range of foods which will cater to everyone and plenty of it so getting up at the crack of dawn to get fed is not necessary. Hats off to the egg chef who made the most perfect eggs known to man and the little lady cooking the traditional Moroccan flat breads they were delicious!!  Location- the savoy is 5 minutes from the medina and taxis were always around on the main street to take you to the centre. The hotel is also attached to a mall a few restaurants and supermarket which we found super handy for stocking up on water and snacks for the room.  Overall we have had an amazing stay and we are very sad to be leaving tomorrow. I’m rather fussy when it comes to where we stay (especially more so now that i’m pregnant and require a little more comfort in life) and I really can’t fault this hotel or the staff and will look forward to returning in the near future. Thank you savoy it’s been wonderful!,Date of stay: February 2020,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YasminL92

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Well Fed Restaurant Reviews wrote a review Feb 2020,10,Avoid this place,They say there is air conditioning there is not. They search your bag for water or alcoholic beverages. When we bought water somewhere else they told us we had to buy it there. They charged my credit card for services not provided and continued to do so until I froze my card with the bank. Pool is freezing cold. Mini fridge in room didn’t work. The room was dirty. There are many nice places to stay in Marrakech Morocco this place is NOT one of them. DO NOT GO THERE. It is definitely not a 5 star. Maybe 2.5 star and that’s generous. If you’ve booked it cancel it. If your looking at it keep scrolling. Coming into the hotel with a bag from another store is like going through customs at the airport. Actually it’s worse than customs. I had booked through Hotels.com  thank goodness when I called to tell them what was going on at that property they moved us instantly.,Date of stay: February 2020,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Niagara Falls, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wellfed

Yes when you do arrive at checkin is a bit of a wait but the wait is worth it. The room we got and the view was beautiful.    The staff at the breakfast in the morning are KAOUTAR & BENBAHA are so welcoming and friendly. They go out of there way to give you the service you require and when they get to know you they deliver at such quality.    The staff at the Bella lounge who are MOHAMED & KAOUTAN were fantastic and made sure my birthday was one not to forget. Again service was excellent and they go all the way to provide for you.    The food was excellent and the cake they made was so beautiful words cannot Express how we feel.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Rosalie S wrote a review Feb 2020,50,Long weekend in Savoy Le Grand,I booked a garden view room as it was the one which came up on the web site. After looking at the other rooms it appeared this may be of a lesser quality to the pool view rooms. In fact it was better. It was only a short walk past the gym to the rooms and as well as a garden view it had a pool view too. It wasn't as noisy as the pool view area which suited us well. We ate in the on site restaurants Alfredo and also Bella. The food was reasonable although a bit expensive. The selection of white wine was limited but the most popular one was Medaillon which was fine. We had been told that the hotels etc do not serve alcohol and that you couldn't take any into the hotel with you. In fact that just isn't true of Savoy Le Grand. Some of the restaurants not in the hotel don't serve alcohol and those that do only serve it if you sit inside the restaurant and not outside in view of passers by. The staff at the Savoy Le Grand were all excellent and very helpful. Our waitress Sara in the breakfast room was very good and nothing was too much trouble for her. Also all the receptionists were very helpful especially Touria who was on duty on our last day in the hotel.    The bedrooms were spacious and clean and the bathrooms were also large and equipped with a small hairdryer and toiletries. The bedrooms had a coffee maker which we never worked out how to use and also a fridge and safe. There is also an ironing board and iron. It also had a large flat screen TV which had one channel which showed films and 3 or 4 news channels in English.    All in all our short stay at Savoy Le Grand was excellent and we shall definitely return.,Date of stay: February 2020,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RosalieS193

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Nbvilela wrote a review Feb 2020,10,The worst possible combination. A 23 month old and left over drugs.,Yes the title may seem a little bit too much but it is not. We staid for 2 nights in this hotel ( we had already staid last year and everything was fine) and it was an experience we will never forget.  1. The room was not properly clean;  2. Due to its lack of cleanliness several things were not ok. To start with the bathtub had hair from the previous guests. Black hair mine is red. On the floor of the living room we found some small pieces of something. We initially thought it would be mice fezes due to the shape and the way it was scattered on the floor and we called cleaning services.  3. The cleaning staff came and told us it could not be mice fezes and they would look into it. I WANT TO STRESS THE FACT THAT WE WERE TRAVELING WITH A BABY.  4. Later we were told by an employee that what was found on the floor was no more and no less than and citing him “ MARROCAN CHOCOLATE” and that he could get us some if we wanted ( I still question myself weather he was really offering or just ironizing the whole situation.... and I rest unsure of which of the options I find less serious). He then told us that it was common as Morocco is the number one exporter of Hax in the world.  5. Not only in non smoking room there is smoking but drugs are sold smoked and consumption clearly facilitated in a not ADULTS ONLY HOTEL.  6. The staff didn’t even care of the risks of having drugs left around the floor with small children that just put everything in their mouth around.  7. We were offered sweets and a vase of flowers to be put in the room. And problem was solved in their perspective.  8. We were also told that they also have people selling and buying other heavier drugs within the hotel premises and that the hotel has no control.  9. Had my child swallowed any of that stuff I would be making this testimony in the police and later in court. They are not aware of the responsibility and liability they would face. It’s almost unbelievable.  10. We booked one of their most expensive rooms. Still nobody cared about how it was cleaned.,Date of stay: January 2020,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/no_miv538

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Jay P wrote a review Feb 2020,30,"I want to rate lower, but I won't.",I'll start this review explaining why I want to give the Savoy a lower rating. They made a very poor first impression.    1. We arrived in mid-afternoon after an early flight following our wedding got scammed by our taxi driver to the hotel and all we wanted was to check-in change and relax a bit before going out for the evening. Hotel Reception took our details put our card on record and then told us they needed 10 minutes to ready our room. Check-in being at 3 and it being 14.50 I think okay and take a seat.    25 minutes later I approached the reception again. Same answer. One of the bell boys was nice enough to pour us some tea but the reception didn't give us any more information.    After an hour I approached the reception again. One of the attendants smiled and handed me the room key no explanation or apology.    2. We had our final meal in Marrakech at the Bella Lounge in the hotel. It wasn't busy and the staff were very inattentive and callous. We spotted our waiter chatting with his colleagues and taking puffs at the sheesha counter. (He wasn't serving it to a table. just puffing). We made it clear when ordering desserts that we had to leave for our flight soon. I told him what we wanted. He left for 10 minutes chatting with his colleagues before coming back to confirm our desserts and putting them through. They came out 20 minutes later only after we pushed him for it reminding him of our flight.    3. The outdoor pool appears to be there for show. The temperature was 25+ C throughout our visit but the pool temperature was displayed at 16C throughout. I don't know whether the staff ever wondered why no one was using it.    Now the positives. Why I'm not giving the Savoy a lower rating.    1. The breakfast spread was lavish and amazing. The staff were attentive constantly checking who needed a top-up for their drink and whether everything was alright. The food was fresh cheese and meat being sliced to order omelette pancake and flatbread stations all were top notch. There was a selection of continental breakfast and Moroccan selections.    2. The concierge was great. He gave us good advice regarding where to go and what to avoid ordering us taxis and letting us know how much they charge. We liked him very much and if not for the final meal at Bella Lounge he alone would have pushed my rating higher.    3. The rooms were large and comfortable with all the modern amenities. The turnover system was on point and the couple times we had the do not disturb sign up the room was done when we went out later in the day.    4. We had a late flight returning home and the reception manager let us checkout 2 hours later for no extra charge.    Overall it was a good visit. If I were to visit Morocco again I would consider the hotel but am likely to explore other options too.,Date of stay: January 2020,,United Kingdom,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O6242YNjayp

We had an amazing experience at Savoy we are very satisfied about every service offered to us. Big room always darling clean and with everything we needed (tea coffee water...). We asked to check in later the day we left because our flight was late in the afternoon and the receptionists very kindly let us check in later for free and then spend the rest of the time at the pool and use the changing rooms of the indoor pool to have a shower and be ready for our flight. Amazing breakfast we loved it. We tried the SPA and we were very satisfied about the Hammam. It was our first time and we think it was one of the best experiences of our holiday highly recommended. Each person of the staff was very helpful friendly and kind. Very good food at the restaurant in the Hotel and we enjoyed a live music show our last night.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Grace T wrote a review Jan 2020,10,Avoid! Not worth the hassle. Awful experience. Very disappointed.,My 12yo son and I checked in with high hopes. The place seemed empty and is huge. The room is big with two doubles and a balcony and big bathroom. At first glance apart from the not working door lock we checked in at 9pm and just wanted to watch a movie and have a nice comfy night in the Savoy Le Grand Marrakech!    Sadly there is a nightclub next door which is open until 5am with bass so loud I can't sleep. I called reception at 2.45 am and was told to wait 10 minutes. Then I finally established it won't stop til 5am. I doubt I will sleep.    Also with the lock on the door not working and alot of noise and smokers in the hallway as a mum here with my young son I don't feel very safe.    The curtains don't block out light and the lights around the pool are like streetlights.    There is hair in the bathroom when we arrived. No bath just a shower.    There is one tiny pot of uht cream for coffee but nothing for tea. I called room service to ask for milk and another tea bag they told me to call housekeeping. I called housekeeping they told me to call room service for milk. I got tea bags about 40 minutes later but no milk.    To be honest after a long drive today I just can't be bothered with the hassle of this place.    Paying top end and having a bad experience is just annoying and after reading others experiences I regret booking here last minute and expecting the Savoy to be a reliable choice.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Shivon wrote a review Jan 2020,50,Breakfast,Great start to the morning. Arrive for breakfast and the waiter AbdelKarim is fantastic. Very polite and helpful. Nothing is too much for him. Always making sure we have everything we need. Very happy person and always smiling. Will go the extra mile - bringing extra tea and coffee in the morning. The staff at here are lovely. We met Raafat today for the first time so welcoming and friendly. Raafat also was very attentive and ensuring we had everything we needed. The hotel is beautiful location is great. We have a suite and it’s so luxurious. Overall AbdelKarim is one of the best waiters I have come across. I have stayed in many 5 star hotels and none of them have staff like him. All hotels need someone like AbdelKarim he makes your holiday feel more special with the service he gives.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,kishi wrote a review Jan 2020,40,Massive property. Good break.,We stayed in January so the property was empty due to off season. This may have impacted our stay as it was not so busy.    Regarding bag checks/food/drinks - my bag was checked only once. After this the security recognised me and let me through without a bag check (though still walking through the detectors) with a smile. They were very lovely and let my water bottle through even after they checked my bag. There is however a sign that says no outside food and drinks to be brought in the property. I assume this is because there is a supermarket right next door and they encourage you to spend your money within grounds. We didn't have issues with it though so I can't comment much. Probably depends on the security on the day.    Location - right next to Menara Mall (not that great to be honest. But has enough cheaper eats for when you can't be bothered to walk far). Carrefour market next door great for snacks or anything you've forgotten. 20-30 minute walk to Gueliz and the Medina. Area has wide pavements which was nice and felt safe walking as long as you watch out for crossings as roads in Morocco can be chaotic. Police everywhere if there's any issues. Was happy to stay in Hivernage instead of the busier parts of Marrakech as less people to hassle you as you walk.    Check in/check out - probably the longest check in process I've ever done. Not enough people at the reception so queue builds up. Check out is faster if there's no queue. The process itself was fine but stood in the queue for so long and the hotel didn't seem busy.    Breakfast - same every day (as with most hotels). Food is good. A lot to choose from. Staff very attentive! They're always there to serve and making sure to grab your dirty plates so you have more space. Make sure to ask for the tea! The main guy who serves it pours it for you Moroccan style.    Staff/service - very good. Can't really complain. We got everything we asked for. Room service was prompt but the menu isn't very extensive.    Rooms - We paid for a suite which was a lot bigger than I expected. Probably too big for 2 people. We didn't end up using half of the space (oops). Rooms are clean enough. Showers are really nice. There was a jacuzzi bath in out suite but I didn't trust it enough to use it.    Pool/spa - outside was obviously too cold for swimming. We saw a bunch of people sunbathing during the day but it wasn't hot for us at all. The indoor pools are nice. Comfortable temperature (said 30C). There are two pools I assume one is for children. Spa is extra charge. You can access the hot tub + sauna for I think around £25 per person if memory serves me right. Maybe not the cheapest but the hot tub was just what I needed.    Restaurants - we only tried the Alfredo. It was decent. London prices. The tiramisu is not tiramisu though sorry. There's a lot of food places nearby so it's not much of an issue.    All in all it was a good experience. Partner enjoyed his birthday trip. We didn't come across as many problems as a lot of the reviewers have so I count myself lucky.,Date of stay: January 2020,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ihsikx

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Abdul B wrote a review Jan 2020,40,Great Facilities and hotel but is this Morocco,This is a great hotel and has everything you could want. The reception area smells like a spring garden the rooms are excellent and spacious the restaurant has an amazing selection of foods and offcourse there is a spa and amazing pool.    So what's the catch??? well its the strange French procedural overtones.If you have a straight forward check in offcourse its not a problem but if like us you had check in issues then do not expect the staff to speak and understand sufficient English to help you. There is a very prescriptive process and they cannot understand anything outside of this. After 2 hours calling the UK late into the night the hotel staff finally agreed to help by offering accommodation. Does anyone want to go through this on Day 1 of their holiday? There were lots of other smaller issues I observed which could easily be fixed with some common sense.    The staff are generally great and with good humour.    This would be an even better hotel if they stopped trying to be French and promoted Moroccon concepts and hospitality. After all guests are in Morocco to experience Morocco not France. We should be celebrating the great moroccan culture.,Date of stay: December 2019,,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/abdulbutt1
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,NK1990 wrote a review Jan 2020,50,"Surprisingly GREAT Experience - Service, Room and Resort Grounds",My husband and I were very very pleasantly surprised with our experience at this hotel. I say surprised because we had difficulty booking a place to stay in Marrakech and didn't think to mark the Savoy as an option till last minute. In pictures and reviews people say it is average or just good but I actually found that it was some of the best consistent service and experience we received in Marrakech.    1. Concierge Staff - can't say enough good things. These people were earnest helpful (without any intent to make tips) honest with their recommendations and proactive. They helped us make numerous (hard to get) restaurant reservations between Christmas and New Years. They ordered us taxis when it was hard to find one AND negotiated prices down for us at times. They sat with us to talk us through what restaurants are great good or overrated...and they did all this without expecting anything in return.    2. Restaurant Staff - the breakfast in the morning that was included in the hotel bill was EXTENSIVE and so so well staffed. There was in fact so much staff around we could get whatever we needed within a few minutes. If anyone has been to restaurants in Marrakech....the service is generally A LOT slower than this. The man who made the hookah was so proactive to come and change the coal and check the quality of the hookah. The room service attendants were also very very prompt.    3.Room - the room was HUGE and we booked last minute for a standard room. We had a big kind sized bed and the room probably could have fit 2.5 king sized beds. The bathroom was also large. We had already been in Fes before this and parts of southern Spain and this was by far the biggest room we stayed in. It was such a comfortable room where we could spread out our things have space for each of our suitcases and clothes to hang up...a big glass door with a large comfortable balcony overlooking the 2nd of two GIGANTIC pools. It was also a VERY clean room. Crisp white sheets clean wooden floors clean marble / tile bathroom clean white tub....    4. Resort Grounds - the overall property is perfectly located in the Havernage area which is near a lot of other hotels and an easy 20-30 min stroll to the Medina. The grounds were very clean (including the public bathrooms...which is very important to me and I'm often a tough critic of). Its right next to the Menara Mall which made it easy to pick up last minute things. The resort was very very large with a large front entrance. All around the resort (in the city area) were very large sidewalks that we felt very safe walking around in because there were police officers at every major light. There were also lots of other tourists strolling around. It cost roughly 30-50dh to get anywhere that we needed unless it was peak hours (then rates went up 100-200dh - whatever the taxi driver demanded because there weren't many available at peak times).    Overall this was a hotel that was worth the money to stay at. It may not be a royal palace-like resort but it was a great roomy clean resort with amazingly nice and helpful staff. My husband and I would definitely stay here again!,Date of stay: December 2019,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/77nikhi

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Anon wrote a review Jan 2020,30,Was expecting more from a 5* Hotel,I stayed at the hotel recently when I came to Marrakesh to celebrate my 26th birthday. Nora at reception was very good and gave us a nice room as I was celebrating my birthday however I expected the hotel to provide complimentary birthday cake or something which I have normally received when celebrating. The hotel did nothing special for me. The service at breakfast is very slow I had to ask 4 waiters for a pot of tea and took them 20mins to bring this and I has finished my breakfast by this point. However the highlight for breakfast was the women making fresh arabic bread that was very tasty. The housekeeping service was terrible! We called for fresh towels and they did not come until 2 hours later and this was after calling 5 times to ask where the towels were. The indoor pool smells and isn''t looked after. You have to pay an additional fee to use the indoor jacuzzi. The rooms are old fashioned and could do with an update. Overall it was a OK trip I just think the hotel need better staff and a refurbishment to keep up to the Savoy standards. However the location of the hotel is great and we walked to most places.,Date of stay: December 2019,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shalgad

Very tasty food one gentleman doing fresh omelettes is a literal star! Professional  excellent cook and super smiley person.    But the two people who really make my morning and my whole day every time I approach the restaurant is Morad Terrasse and Binbaha Mohamed !!  They run to assist you with a constant smile and they are so professional! I work in service industry  that’s why I can tell and I can appreciate a genuine smile genuine gestures and people who love their work !  As soon as they see me they know which table I like outside they keep it and help me sit bring me Tabasco before even saying anything (the first time they noticed and remember it for the next 4 days I was there) and all of the drinks they know I like to drink. And refill them in seconds  they are so fast you don’t even see them coming ! A big mabrouk to people who pay attention even to small details!

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Mirs wrote a review Dec 2019,30,Birthday Trip,The Savoy Le Grand Hotel is a beautiful hotel. We were fortunate to have some great members of staff take care of us Jamal and Justine. They were brilliant! However there were six of us on the holiday three in each room. We should have all had the same room but unfortunately our three other friends were on the complet opposite side of the hotel in a room that was nothing as nice as ours. They finally got moved a day before we were to leave which was unacceptable as we all paid the same amount of money for the trip. Also contacting the hotel was a nightmare in trying to arrange a birthday greeting/surprise for my friend but they came through with a nice surprise. But the towels initially in the room were unclean and when we asked for things like robes and more towels it seemed to get lost in translation and there was some confusion. The food in the hotel was amazing the staff in the restaurants were great. However be warned they do not have an incident report book. I had a nasty fall and slammed my head into the ground and had to call the doctor apparently in an established hotel such as the savoy le grand they do not have one. Luckily Kaouti Bella Lounge Hostess manged to help me along with my friend and a couple at the hotel back to my room.

The location can't be any more perfect than it already is; plentiful cafes and parlours around and also restaurants such as Buddha bar and other clubs are literally walking distance from the hotel. The hotel was really close to the airport which was also a plus for us.  All in all I genuinely have no bad things to day about the place because they seriously were that good and also on a side note just a special shout out to the concierge Othman who was a really jolly and helpful person and would never fail to greet us and obviously always ensured we were looked after so a great big thanks to him and ALL the other staff.

Most of the staff friendly and attentive. I want to highlight a couple of strange experiences with concierge/bell boys which let their other colleagues in concierge down. I don't want to brand them all with the same negative review as most were attentive and professional. But the bell boy who took our luggage with us to our room 1) claimed he had instructed the receptionist to book us into a ""nice"" room in the very far corner of the hotel (he does not control this room allocation - we agree a room with reception directly ourselves - why insult our intelligence) and 2) advised us on entering the room not to book activities through the hotel (very expensive) but via him. When I stay at hotels such as this I don't want to deal with employees trying to run businesses on the side and pushing these to us. Then on another night we found it very hard to contact concierge to arrange a restaurant booking and did not receive any call backs despite specifically requesting this over the phone to concierge in one phone call and then enlisting help from reception. Given the distance from our room to reception we should be able to do this via phone. There were a couple of younger guys in concierge who I must emphasise were extremely friendly and helpful offering excellent service.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Hannah N wrote a review Nov 2019,30,So much potential,The hotel is in a good spot and very clean. The problem is service of staff. Breakfast is generally great service but it declines from there. We often had to ask 3 times for things like coffee or reminders for our food. No towels get put in the room after cleaning so you always have to phone to ask for them. The only notable staff who were very helpful were ALAE and JAWAD. They offered lots of tips and always couldn’t do more for you.  The spa is good but expect hotel prices and no negotiations or deals. The rooms were blasted with hot air and they wouldn’t put the AC on. I appreciate it is cold for locals but not so much for tourists. This made sleeping quite uncomfortable as the room was stuffy. It takes around 20 minutes to walk to the main square. The hotel doesn’t help negotiate rates for Taxi’s so expect to pay 80-100 dirhams to get to the airport. We found that walking away works and other drivers will offer to do it for the price you offer.,Date of stay: November 2019,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hannahn303

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Leigh2211 wrote a review Nov 2019,50,Unparalleled customer service!!,Our expectations on a recent stay at the Savoy Le Grand we’re so far exceeded thanks to the efforts of the team and a few individual staff members - Noureddine Mostapha and General Manager Nadir.  These individuals went above and beyond to locate and safely return to us my wife’s diamond necklace which was dropped on the last morning of our stay at the hotel. They coordinated between the restaurant housekeeping security and the entire staff team over a 5 hour period to piece together where the necklace was actually dropped and retrieve it.    Other highlights of our stay included the delicious buffet breakfast and friendly welcoming staff showing kindness to our two small children at every encounter.    Thank you so much to Noureddine Mostapha Nadir and the entire Savoy team - your conscientiousness is unparalleled and we can’t recommend your hotel highly enough.,Date of stay: November 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Leigh2211
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,jewell43 wrote a review Nov 2019,40,Great service,We are currently vacationing in Marrakech and having a blast and the Savoy Le Grand was part of the reason why. The hotel grounds are beautiful. It’s considered a 5 star and while it’s very nice it would likely be only a 4 star back in the states. We’re staying in a suite. It is extremely nice spacious and clean upon arrival. There is a living room huge bedroom  huge patio and 1.5 bathrooms. Much more than we could use. They include slippers robes a mini bar coffee machine a desk and two televisions. There is also a nice dressing room. They also get you a good selection of toiletries including Argan Oil soap. Housekeeping did a good job cleaning. My only complaint was that they left a cleaning rag on the floor in the bedroom and didn’t refill the Kleenex. The breakfast buffet was good with a huge variety. Lots of pastries an omelet station turkey sausage potatoes fruit soups and much more. The turkey sausage was undercooked the first day and I didn’t eat it anymore after that but it appeared better prepared the 2nd day. They also had gluten free items which I really appreciated(but you have to ask). A young lady named Kaoutar in the dining room made sure to get me my gluten free breads and even remembered me the next day and asked if she could bring them out again for me. She was incredibly nice and attentive and I really appreciated her efforts in recognizing me the next day 😊 The pool is huge. The gym and spa area are nice as well although the price for a one hour deep tissue massage is 950mad ($95 us)which is more than I pay in the states so I decided against it. Room service was decent. We ordered a pizza which was just so so. Food can be pretty expensive so we ate in the Medina or at the food court at the mall which is attached to the hotel. The Medina is about a 30 minute walk. We took a taxi ride for $7 US) . Overall I would stay again at the hotel and I highly recommend,Date of stay: November 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Charlotte, North Carolina",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jewell43

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,tarrita wrote a review Nov 2019,30,Disappointing 3-star experience,"I'd give the Savoy 2.5 stars overall based on my experience and 3 for the room. This is the equivalent of an American Best Western or Holiday Inn Express except on a massive scale. It is absolutely not a 5-star hotel--not the rooms not the facilities not the service.    I wish I had seen it before I booked because I would have gone elsewhere. I guess if you were on holiday with kids or a large family and cost was an issue you might get value for the dollar/euro. There are two gigantic pools but I wasn't there for the pools so it was wasted on me.    The gym was nice and well equipped. I didn't see towels but there was a water dispenser. The conference room we booked was new clean and spacious however there was no attendant. When the day started at 9 am the room wasn't set up and when we needed AV there was nobody there to get it working.    Other positives might be that there is a big mall next door so if you need anything you have easy access to things like souvenirs. The guest room was large but simple. The first day it was missing the bathroom amenities and the do not disturb sign which was fixed later on. But they do give you 2 water bottles each day.    The negative is that The Savoy was impersonal and service was sub-par. We had a large group and check-in was a nightmare. It was poorly handled mixing up rooms and names number of keys etc. When I told them there was a problem with rooms being incorrectly assigned (namely one person left without a room) they claimed I was wrong instead of offering to fix the problem. After a bit of back and forth we worked it out but it could have been handled so much better. There was no ""the customer is right"" kind of attitude.    Cleanliness was hit or miss. The carpets in the halls were dirty. The room had an odor to it and it took a while to make sure the ground floor sliding door would actually lock. There was a horrible perfume pumped into the lobby and someone decided to pull out paint thinner during breakfast to do some cleaning nearby. It left a bad taste in your mouth literally.    The food was okay. In order to serve that many people the quality just drops. The servers at breakfast seemed quite rushed.    I would stay elsewhere if I were going back to Marrakesh.",Date of stay: November 2019,Trip type: Traveled on business,"New York City, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tarrita
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Akiema F wrote a review Nov 2019,40,"Despite the length cons, I had an amazing birthday.",Apart from a few things this hotel was more or less everything I could’ve asked for.    Pros -  Really warm welcome upon arrival bags were taken and we were shown to our room. Check-in was also a very smooth process. The room was amazing I booked this for my 25th birthday and they went above and beyond by offering a bigger room (we even had our own sinks each). On the night leading up to my birthday the hotel went above and beyond making the room nice and romantic and also given me a birthday treat. Breakfast was different (not your typical English or American style breakfast) but I was more than happy with visiting the omelette/cold meats and cheeses stations daily along with the crepe and waffle station. Juice and tea were topped up constantly as someone was always walking around. I had a pizza from the pizzeria and that was really good also had a other meal by the pool on my last day which again was good. (Eating outside of the hotel will save you so much.) The amount of pools and the size of the hotel were great. We were always finishing something new and the spa was a nice atmosphere too with relaxing couples treatments/ it was the best way to start my birthday. The staff were helpful and always smiling and this hotel was beautiful not to mention the lovely scent. There is a cash machine in the hotel reception which I used on a few occasions and they have a currency exchange also. Great location being attached to the Menara mall which had a supermarketBurger King indoor market etc.    Cons -  My makeup suddenly “disappeared” after returning from breakfast and the room had been cleaned. The cleaners and manager demanded it couldn’t be them which isn’t right as you can’t be sure. After a long discussions we came to an agreement which the hotel manager handled and was very apologetic. Upon ordering room service it took a long time to arrive and when it did arrival one of the meals were wrong (however again the manager removed this from our bill). There was also no instructions explaining that room service need to be ordered through the tv and there was no phone number or manual for how to call reception so I had to make a long journey downstairs. The mini fridge in the room has a bar menu however only water is in the fridge so it’s pointless. The slot I had for my massage was 60 minutes this was somehow only 45 minutes and then we we’re left In there to lay down for the remainder of the time. (15 minutes paying for nothing) and lastly. It’s impossible to contact the hotel or riot to visiting. They don’t answer emails and the website doesn’t work.,Date of stay: October 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AkiemaF
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,ahutilakhani wrote a review Nov 2019,10,Disgusting service!,My partner and I came to this hotel for our first ever holiday and my birthday expecting a lovely stay and a true ‘savoy’ 5* experience. It was no where near 5*.    When we first arrived to our room there was a damp smell and the room wasn’t the cleanest! We requested to be moved but we never heard back!    Breakfast is very limited and the staff seem almost frustrated to serve you! Also you’d be lucky to revive anything you’ve requested at all!    My partner requested flowers champagne and cake for my birthday (all of which he was happy to pay for) the hotel at the end of the day place a pillow with happy birthday on it and our bathroom towels folded onto our bed without replacing them meaning we had to use those again when needed.    The following day we woke up later so I requested that housekeeping clean our room before we returned in the afternoon. They informed us that it would be “right away”. However when we returned in the afternoon nothing was done. I called again before we left in the evening however once again when we returned nothing was done. Now being 12am we just wanted some clean towels water and someone to check on our heating which was blowing out cold air. We waited until 1.30am for this and the technician came saw it and never came back! It was extremely cold that night and the hotel didn’t seem to care less.    Needless to say I called the manager in the morning who was pathetically useless. She complained that the hotel was full which is no excuse! She offered to let us have a later checkout by a few hours. Once I got off the phone I went to shower but realised that housekeeping had come into our room while we were at breakfast and taken the clean towels we requested the night before!!! It was clear that we hadn’t checked out as all of our belongings were still there! Were they planning on reusing these towels for another room?!? After 3 calls - once to management and ONE HOUR later I received a towel.    Utterly exhausted by our experience we checked out early and met with the manager. She almost seemed amused by our distraught and offered to upgrade us on our next stay with no details as to how we could do this (not that we would come back). My partner asked if she could atleast organise a transfer to the airport for us (5min drive). She said she would see what she could do but never followed up. We ended up having to book and pay for it at the concierge.    Do not waste your money time and sanity with this establishment. The service from the team and management is not what I expected from the savoy!    Hopefully this feedback with help with their improvements and resource more towels!,Date of stay: November 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ahutilakhani

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,zuber wrote a review Nov 2019,20,Disappointed,We stayed at the Savoy during our 5 nights in Marrakech and was left very disappointed by the hotel. The hotel itself is very nice the rooms are big and spacious and clean however the lighting in the room was very dim. We had a balcony and I believe most rooms also do. The area around the hotel is very lively you have a direct connection to the menara mall next door are a couple of restaurants and a club and just around the corner a line of restaurants.    The service at the hotel is the worst I have ever come across we arrived at the hotel and the lady at the desk outside did not even acknowledge us we was not helped with our luggage until she noticed my wife was struggling. The check in process and reception desk just seemed to take forever.    The wifi in my room was not working so on the first night I told reception and was told IT are back in the morning and to ask again at breakfast which I did - it took around 8 times to complain and involved speaking to reception housekeeping IT hotel night manager and the guest relations manager before something was actually done and even after that it still did not work correctly.    The house keeping service was horrendous after cleaning our room we was not given any towel housekeeping explain they will do in 10 mins it took until the next day clean to arrive. The evening before we checked out we requested some clean towels as we didnt not get the room cleaned they sent 1 towel and we didnt get another.    Breakfast - the selection at breakfast was not the greatest however this could be more of a personal opinion however the service was just awful. There was never enough cutlery and we would need to ask 3 or 4 waiters before we would get it. Drinks are provided at the table and a waiter would come and ask what we would want we would get asked by 5 waiters and none of them would come back with the drinks until we complained - this was the same every day.    The fridge in the room was not working and the kettle was leaking which after service we had I did not even bother to complain about.    The room was for 2 people but everything seemed to be for 1 person as an example there was on 1 room slippers provided.    The hotel provides 3 pools 2 outdoor and 1 indoor but we had to wait 30 minutes to get a towel and we just never ended going again. The sauna and steam room are NOT free and come at a cost for a 5 star hotel I would have hoped these to be part of my costs.    The Guest Relations Manager Murad was very friendly and spoke very good English but he offered us the world but really gave us nothing. We wanted to extend for an extra night and looked at booking another hotel until Murad offered to extend an extra night for the same rate we paid for our previous. This was not the case and he came back with a price higher than on the internet.    Overall I do not recommend the hotel purely down to the service.,Date of stay: November 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zuber001

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Bluemoon3x1y wrote a review Nov 2019,30,Nice suit average service,We stayed in a suit with two rooms which was big and comfortable for a family of 3.    When we arrived the reception was not anything special or any warm welcome. the lady receptionist asked us smt like a hundred dollar deposit per day. Our full amount of room was already paid so! What’s the hurry?  I had requested a quiet room and got a room overlooking to the back street and parking area. It was generally quiet except some morning heard the cars. Sitting in the balcony looking at this was not anything special.  Three days later we realised there was another building with a separate pool. This was really quiet we felt bad we were not offered this part.  Like other reviews we also had the same experience with the slow service. It was painful to get the room service to bring towels and no hand towels were really available. We thought this was strange in the hotels you always get a set of towel per person not here. Room was cleaned daily this was good but we noticed curtains looked dirty.  Fridge was empty with a price list next to it. Complementary water and coffee machine available.  Breakfast was good with variety of pastries breads egg station fruits etc. Service in the breakfast was good.  We took a club sandwich by the pool first day which came with cold chicken and cold egg inside. When we asked were told that’s the style in Morocco. We decided not to eat there afterwards.    Some of the staff in the concierge were really good and helpful. What we realised was if you want to book a place sometimes they’d direct you for another. Later we were told that in general the hotel concierges would try to book you places they have agreements or smt like that.    Location is good taxi would cost 50MAD to the old town although you’d be asked 100 same for Gueliz in fact wherever you’d go prepared to be asked 100. But you can negotiate.  We enjoyed Marrakech very much and in general found it easy to navigate and people are really friendly. Be careful about street guides who will approach you without asking to find an address or escort you to somewhere casually helping at the end you may be asked to pay.

From the moment we arrived at the hotel the staff were friendly and helpful being able to answer any questions we had. The service at breakfast was excellent with staff arriving to offer juice and coffee within moments of us sitting down. There is good choice of food including some options that are freshly prepared while you wait. We also ate at both the restaurants and again service was good.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,highimpactuk wrote a review Oct 2019,10,9-month old reservation cancelled without notice,We booked an anniversary stay at this hotel for 2 nights at least 9 months in advance. We got off our flights headed by taxi to the hotel only to be told on arrival that our reservation had been cancelled. As frequent travellers and bearing in mind that this was a prepaid booking we simply could not get our heads around this. What was the reason for the cancellation and why had we not been notified? It turned out that the online agents also had no notice of the cancellation. We paid by credit card and were confident we would get our money back however we still needed a place to stay. Unluckily for us there was a sports event taking place that weekend and most hotels were full.    It transpired that the hotel had taken in a football team - who were happy to pay 3-4 times what was originally paid by folks like us and thus decided to cancel most of the bookings that day - prepaid or not - to make room. We were certainly not alone in this predicament. There were at least two other couples who arrived late like us who were also told their bookings had been cancelled. We subsequently heard from other hoteliers that they had plenty of experience bailing out others with cancelled bookings from this place.    Just before midnight we eventually found refuge in another hotel - which was a complete disaster and a completely different story. This ruined what we had meticulously planned to be a refreshing anniversary break for us. You really have to question the ethics of a hotel that boots out guests simply because they are tempted by a better offer. If we all did this across our daily lives the whole world would grind to a halt. A member of staff confided that the booking was fine until the day we arrived - when the football team decided to extend their stay without warning. Instead of showing them the door the Savoy chose to upset ordinary folks like us.    My advice to you if you have already booked to stay here or are planning to stay here is to check directly with them at least 24 hours before you arrive that your booking is still live. This is quite unusual - and as you have seen in our case even that may not be enough!,Date of stay: May 2019,,"Welwyn Garden City, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/highimpactuk
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,NJass wrote a review Oct 2019,30,Beautiful Hôtel,The hotel is beautiful and the location is great but don’t expect any good service. The check-in staff are not professional and can’t be too bothered with any questions or concerns you might have. We were standing for a while before we were able to get someone’s attention to check us in. No they were not busy with any other customers but rather busy chatting to each other and having a good time! That was our experience every time we needed to speak to any front desk members. The rooms were clean but had one hand towel and half a roll of toilet paper. We called and asked for towels toilet paper and box of tissue. After few hours we had to call again! That was our daily routine. According to the manager and staff they only have one towel per room. Same went for the bed sheets. Every day our sheets and towel were removed but not replaced until we called a few times. WOW! The food venue staff were wonderful and tried to make our dinning experience great every time. Clearly there needs to be training for the front desk and housekeeping staff and a few professional managers to make sure the hotel is run properly. What a shame because it’s truly a beautiful hotel.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,I love travelling wrote a review Oct 2019,40,Would be a fantastic hotel if service is improved,Savoy is a great conference hotel. Huge with nice big rooms.  The bedroom is spacious with a big bed which is also quite comfortable. The bathroom is a nice size. I had a bath / shower and it looks new. Pity the water changes temperature throughout the shower going from boiling hot to freezing cold.  My room was ground floor in front of the pool. Had a small nice terrace with dinner furniture. if you get this kind of room BE CAREFUL AS THE CLEANING STAFF LOVE LEAVING THE DOOR UNLOCKED. Not sure if this is planned but it also happened to my colleague.  There are 2 really nice pool areas. 1 is quiet and there other quite lively.  The gym is nice with quite a lot of different machines.  I didnt have time to check the spa.  My biggest disappointment in this hotel is the service. Check in is very very slow. I mean very slow. At the restaurants it is horrendously slow. 1 night we waited for more than 1 hour for 1 plate. The covers of three other 2 people did not arrive and we ended up sharing the knife.  Dinner at the buffet is not bad but nothing special. Breakfast is good with quiet a lot of variety.  All in all it is not a bad hotel.

Two niggles from me;    The service in the restaurant during the evenings was very slow.......and I mean slow!!    The Union Jack flag was flying upside down an easy mistake. However having politely reporting it to reception 4 times throughout my stay it was still upside down when I departed 4 days later. Many may consider this trivia but I felt the lack of action was an insult to our Queen & Country.,Date of stay: October 2019,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Greater London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/11Clem

When Najat the hostess at the entrance and the janitor remember your name it really gives you a special feeling. Mourad is a great guy as well! He always has time for a chat and check with you if everything is okay or you need anything.. and if you do.. he makes it happen. Breakfast is something special as well there is nothing they can not get for you the guys are so nice and hospitable. They will bring you everything you need. The hospitality in this hotel is from a whole other level and i am looking forward to my next stay already! <3 Thank you Morad Najat Reda Hasan and all the other personell that remembers the name Keltoum.,Date of stay: October 2019,,The Netherlands,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Keltoum_Casablanca
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Aim wrote a review Oct 2019,40,Lovely Hotel & Excellent Location,We stayed at Savoy three nights during our stay in Marrakesh. The hotel is beautiful with three pools and several restaurants to choose from.    Our room was situated very far within the resort possibly the furthest room section from the lobby and my only compliant is that there was nowhere to get towels or drinks near the pool by our room. It was a 15 minute walk to get towels every day.    The hotel location was nice and had a mall connected that had a supermarket for drinks snacks and anything else you may need during your stay. There was also a nice food court when you wanted a cheap quick lunch.    My husband loved the onsite gym which was very well equipped and clean.    We walked from our hotel to Jemaa el Fna one night to get some exercise but took a taxi back (50 D).

A little further away from Medina but a 20-25min walk which is doable. Otherwise very easy to get taxi. Great pools great fitness center (like really good!) good size breakfast (targeted more towards Europeans not Americans) large property. A wonderful retreat away from the Medina. Plus there is a good size mall connected to it where you can get drinks snacks and lunch easily and cheaply. Not the best shops but the supermarket is great.    But outside of that not much around.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,MaryandAdam wrote a review Oct 2019,40,Decent hotel with good facilities,The Good:    Good location. Not far from the old souk (by taxi) and next door is Menara Mall which is owned by the same company.    The mall next door has an arcade for kids on the top floor. It also has several good shops. Hairdresser travel store food stores and more.    Nice Fitness centre/gym.    The pools are great.    The Bad:    The service at the Bella Lounge is really bad. They get orders wrong. They seem over whelmed even when the place isn’t busy. It’s clear the restaurant manager isn’t doing a great job of managing the team (in our opinion).    The spa service provided for the price is very average.    Overall from a global point of view. It’s slightly above average.

We arrived at 10.30 am and were surprised to find our early check in went seamlessly the room was fine decent size comfortable and air con ok good start. A missing kettle was immediately found by helpful staff and after 3 attempts a working coffee machine was located. The fridge (mini bar) in the room was located inside a cupboard so the door was left open constantly to cool stuff.  adverts say  3 restaurants and 1 coffee shop/café  3 poolside bars and 4 bars/lounges  Nonsense..  There is one place used only for breakfast – which is fantastic – excellent food staff service variety grade 1.  There is NO MOROCCAN restaurant  Rocks bar was only open for 2 hours during our entire visit a joke and not what we paid for  There is no Coffee bar  The only working bar is out by reception (£46 for 2 large gin and tonics)  One restaurant is ok Alfredo the other is really just a pipe hire and smoke joint. We never saw anyone eating there but did try it ourselves one nightTwo Courses with wine approx £80 for 2  Entertainment is extremely limited a little quartet play  Pools were excellent clean and well kept though the pool service was appalling  The staff were all good and friendly I stay staff were all good  But patrolled the main entrance preventing guests from bringing in food and drink.

We ate one evening in the Italian restaurant as I had started to get the flu - stunning service there and was even brought a honey and lemon drink to help sooth my symptoms without even asking.  The only 1 disappointment was the £180 charge to have a late check out as we weren’t being picked up from the hotel until 6. I’ve stayed in many 5 star hotels and never been asked to pay that sort of cost - because of this we passed on the late check out which meant our final day was harder to enjoy through having to get changed in the public toilet to fly home.,Date of stay: September 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Bramhall, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jbrxo

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Sadaf A wrote a review Sep 2019,40,Thank you for your hospitality...,We stayed at Savoy Grand Hotel from 23rd-27th September for my birthday. We would simply recommend this hotel to everyone purely based on the customer service provided by its staff and their exceptional attention to detail. Without the following people our stay would not have been as special as it was.  Mourad (customer relations) was always a pleasure to speak to and made sure we had a comfortable (late) check-out to suit our needs given that we had a late evening flight. His presence definitely made us feel welcome.  Badr (restaurant staff) always delievered excellent service catered to us and made sure we didnt have to trouble ourselves with anything. Each time.  Ismail (lifeguard) also delivered great service. He was very observant and willing to assist even before we had to ask for any help he would be there with a solution.  Abdel (secuity guard) would always put a smile on our faces simply by striking conversation. His recomendations for places to visit and observation/concern regarding my injured foot were very much appreciated.  Finally Rafiq (Senior Concierge) our stay would not have been the same without his generosity and warming nature. When we returned to the hotel from a somewhat dissapointing experience Rafiq made sure we were delivered compensation from the company in question. He made personal arrangements for a henna artist to come to the hotel (only for me) as well as arrange airport transfer for our flight back to London. His passion for helping his customers and making sure each individual left the hotel satisfied was displayed 100% of the time. Rafiq really made our stay at the hotel unforgettable.

We spent days by the pool and they were busy although the staff was still so attentive kind and fast. I had the luck to be served by Abdel Karim. He is the best. Was checking on me often and always with energy and a smile on his face.  We had drinks and an amazing smoked salmon salad for lunch - amazing! One of the best I had!

Upon arrival our room wasn’t ready and we had to wait 3 hours until it was prepared. They didn’t offer us anything complimentary while we waited. When our room was finally ready it was very basic for a supposedly 5 star hotel and really dusty so wasn’t cleaned to standard . There was not much variety at Breakfast and the customer service was extremely poor. At one point I asked for orange juice on 3 occasions and eventually I just got up and poured it myself. The lobby coffee tables the carpet lift the cutlery and our room where all dirty and dusty and for someone who has OCD it gave me severe anxiety. I ended up with a rash during our 7 night stay and they brought me a nurse to the room to check up on me but she didn’t speak much English. During our stay the manager mourad was very friendly and helpful. He ordered me a birthday cake and checked up on me and my husband every morning during breakfast.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,motimo99 wrote a review Sep 2019,30,Not welcoming when we arrived,Usually when you enter a 5 star hotel you should be warmly welcomed that wasn’t quite how we were welcomed this time. We were supposed to enter our suite at 3pm but we were told to way an other hour without any explanation. We thought this wasn’t normal but we waited.  After the hour passed still we weren’t allowed to enter our suite i talked to the receptionist again but he still didn’t give me any detail about it he kept on telling me to wait. And waiting with no reason makes you slowly angry especially when you have a two years old baby crying who needs to change.  For the following hour i kept on arguing with the receptionist who still doesn’t give me any reasonable explanation and just tells me to wait for no reason we nearly made a scene that could definitely discredit the hotel. But shortly after there was a man who came out from the reception i think he was the manager or something he talked to us for a moment and told us that the suite was in a very bad condition and needed to be cleaned thoroughly because there was some sort of party in there he promisses us some gifts that were supposed to “calm” us down but we never received them.  We only got the keys to the suite almost three hours after we were supposed to.  The other thing is that the hotel wasn’t very organized due to the huge amount of people that were there at the time. Its not like a hotel is supposed to be empty in order to work well and be organized.  In the swimming pool people always put some towels to reserve chairs the night before which is against the hotel’s policies but they do nothing about it. So if you wake up a little bit late it is impossible for you to find were to sit and the funny thing is that most of them aren’t used at all.  The overall experience was okay because the room itself was beautiful. And hopefully next time we will be treated properly in way fitted for a five star hotel.,Date of stay: August 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"El Jadida, Morocco",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/motimo99

The pool is far too overcrowded and all sunloungers are “reserved” by 9am with either the staff reserving sunloungers for guests or by guests leaving their towels / hats etc on them - there is an insufficient amount of sunbeds for all guests. Bathroom door handle was broken when we got to the room - this was fixed but already left us feeling doubtful about the quality of this hotel. We also reported an issue with our light in the bathroom above the bath which was making it dangerous to have a shower in (limited vision when curtain was drawn). We reported this issue 3 times with no repair after 3 days. Tried to make a complaint with staff unable to understand us in English.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,MHJ90 wrote a review Aug 2019,30,"Good, but nothing special",Stayed here for three nights in August 2019. Good stay but nothing special. First off communication is really poor. Emailed Facebook messaged and emailed again to try and book a transfer from the airport to the hotel but never heard back. Still haven’t actually. So you’ve got to call them to get anything done. The transfer itself was a hugely extortionate 300 dirhams (£30!). Anyway that out of the way the hotel itself: big nice enjoyable for the most part.    A few small annoying things: no outside food or drink allowed. Not ideal during the summer.    Poor choice of channels on TV. Internet didn’t work. Menara Mall next door to the hotel isn’t great - no decent shops / stores of note.    But WiFi was good and the room itself (we had a suite) was spacious clean and cool. Huge swimming pools inside and out but mayhem at the front pool with towels left all over the place. Indoor pool was very nice and modern though.    On checkout no interest from staff whether we had a good time any feedback etc. Felt like a number get in get out. But this is a huge hotel with thousands of people staying at any one time.    In conclusion it’s good - not great. Needs more staff and investment from the senior managers I’d think as it’s got potential. Probably worth it for the cash but you’d expect more from a five star hotel.,Date of stay: August 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MHJ90

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,akaekk wrote a review Aug 2019,30,Luxury at a price,Facilities are great very clean amazing room and pool is gorgeous. The selection at breakfast means you do not have to repeat your options any morning........But  Service is terrible. OMG. We gave them chance after chance but you could order a drink/food then go to the room have a shower get dressed and go back to the bar and it still wouldn’t have arrived and there is so many staff all standing about looking at one another. It doesn’t get any better when you ask for the bill. What’s more frustrating is that they do not allow you to go to the bar order a drink and get it yourself. I appreciate this is all associated with the “high level of service” but that’s not there. Thankfully breakfast was self service.    It didn’t come as any surprise that a 5* hotel would have 5* prices so we bought little from them. Don’t think you can bring food and drink in though because there are bag searches at the door every time you return from somewhere.  Get down to the pool early with your towel because otherwise it’s a pantomime but entertaining to see people lose the head when they can’t get a bed. By 9am every lounger is occupied.    We got an upgrade when we arrived no idea why because we didn’t ask for it but our room was as big as my house and I would do anything to have the shower they have. We booked here for its location - 15 min walk to Médina and the pool area and we got both.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,rko21 wrote a review Aug 2019,10,Really poor,We visited the hotel in May 2018. We had a ground floor poolside room. The Wifi was non-existant and could only access it from the bathroom or the ground floor terrace - not in bed or at the table/workstation. The housekeeping was really poor the bathroom was not cleaned properly (the sink basin floors and bedroom rug also). The room had a hammam style shower which was nice. The rest of the room was average. The pool was cold (not heated) and noisy from music playing. The breakfast buffet was OK but so crowded busy and messy. Very poorly organised. The breakfast manager Chaimae was nice but overwhelmed. The indoor pool is nice and heated.    The worst part was on our last day when there was deafening construction and renovation noise next to our room effecting the whole ground floor of the block we were staying. It started at 10am. We contacted reception shortly after 10am to ask them about the noise. They said to come to reception to change rooms. We packed up and did so. When we arrived at reception they said the room would not be available til 3pm. I was shocked. We had to wait until 3pm for a noise-free room and already had packed everything up.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Original-Lass wrote a review Jul 2019,50,A luxurious friendly oasis - what more can I say,Highly recommend if you want a few days in a crazy city but staying a little away from the madness in an oasis (probably not somewhere I’d bring under 16s though. Although there are children here inflatables in the pool etc I don’t think there’s any entertainment for them. And I wouldn’t want to take them in the madness of the souks/medina.    Read the Conversant Traveller blog too we found them very useful especially about scams in the souks/medina & how to avoid them. Hotel is only 10 min from airport & 10 min from medina. Next to a mall (Menara Mall) with direct access from hotel - all security controlled) & modern international chain restaurants. Eg Burger King Chillis & Buddha Lounge.    Tip1- hotel food/drink prices are similar to UK so expensive for Morocco. And they won’t let you bring any food/drink in fair enough I understand. Large draught lager 75 dirhams (c£6 each) by pool. Wine/spirts much more expensive. Some Cocktails not bad 120 dirhams (c £10). We ate a large/late breakfast & poss a snack mid-aft (Pauls patisserie in Menara Mall next door is lovely!) then ate out in evening.    Tip2 - agree taxi prices before you get in suggest to them what you’ll pay. Should be around 50 dirhams (c£4) to medina or 70-100 to airport. We were charged 100 dirhams to medina when I didn’t agree in advance and 200 (c £18) from airport when there seemed to be no bartering a fixed price they said. Hmmm I wasn’t so sure!

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Tarik VIP wrote a review Jul 2019,10,Very Bad Experience !!!,I Came with my Family to this Hotel one year Ago and we have issues with the hotel  they did for us a wrong reservation and front desk and manager was very tough and unfriendly and the service was very poor . I did mention this on trip advisor and next day the management called me and told me that they are sorry for Everything and they wish if I can delete my comments from trip advisor and they promised me next time they will fix all this mistakes and take care of their customers .  And now again I came with my family and again we face same exactly the same issues like last time . And when I called the front desk manager and Explained to him he was weird and said that they are a new management and they can do nothing to take care of old management promises .  Wow  What a hotel ?!!!!!  I think with this kind of attitude from the Hotel Management I don’t think it’s Recommended at all for Anyone to waste their time and money in such hotel if you are looking for a 5 stars hotel treatment Since the Hotel Management are careless and tough and not friendly at all .,Date of stay: July 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tarik-VIP

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Abdulk-47 wrote a review Jul 2019,50,Excellent as usual ( special thanks to Badre poolside bar assistant you are an excellent representative to savoy),Just wanted to say that our stay here was excellent as usual. The location of this luxurious hotel is perfect. A mall next door spoilt for choices with multiple restaurants and fast food chains. Staffing is improving every year. I would like to give a special mention to Badre who works at the main poolside. His attention to detail and service was amazing. He always make himself if you have any questions about anything and always goes the extra mile to satisfy.  Breakfast here is very satisfying again you have multiple options with pretty much anything you can think of for breakfast is made available for you and cooked fresh.  The shisha guys really work hard and you wont ever need to ask for coal change as they are bang on with their timings. Hotel is very clean and maintained well. Poolside entertainment is always excellent with live performances by Moroccan artists daily. There is also a very tranquil feel to the place.

We really enjoyed the room and the area around the hotel. Its just ridiculously busy around the pool they have signs saying you cannot reserve sunbeds and they will remove towels. They don't and it looked like the staff were helping guests to reserve sun beds which is extremely annoying as there are empty beds that you cannot sit on and are empty for hours!!

We had a small problem with the drain in the toilet and our room was moved immediately. The guys that work by the outside restaurant for lunch are so friendly and helpful.  Breakfast was included and what a fantastic choice you had.  The Yoga studio was amazing which is on the hotel complex but separate set up. The classes were fantastic with excellent instructors. 2 pools were amazing even in addition a more secluded on at the back!  The only slight thing is that we had emailed in advance the hotel to indicate it was my 50th birthday the day after I arrived but no mention of it .. perhaps they didn’t get the email.

I don’t remember properly but I think the girl that served us on the front desk was called Sofia? Thank you for making my husbands birthday experience so memorable! With it being the first time visiting Marrakech I was worried about the location of the hotel but it was very convenient being attached to Menara mall and around less than 10 mins from the airport! (Away from the hustle and bustle which is what I wanted) When booking I mentioned it was my husbands birthday the hotel staff went above and beyond to make it special by bringing a birthday cake to the room and by adding cushions and a throw which said ‘happy birthday’ ... honestly I didn’t even have to remind them but they remembered the day and managed to do it when we were by the pool!

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,jonspencer wrote a review Jun 2019,10,Unacceptable overbooking,The night of arrival under an absurd excuse that a plane had delayed the departure and the guests had to stay for the night they told us that the room that we had booked and confirmed months ago was not available so they would send us to another hotel of similar category. After making us pay the rate we had hired months before we were taken to another hotel of lesser category more than half an hour away from the city. It was not until after claiming severely they took us to a closer hotel also of lower category. The next morning after claiming again we were finally given a room in the hotel where we had booked and as compensation they offered us a room superior to the reserved one. Basically it is pure and hard overbooking. They resell the room that you have reserved months before for a much higher price they charge you the same but they send you to another inferior hotel. Terrible and unacceptable for a hotel of this category. Because of this we lost the night of arrival in absurd transfers all with two small children.,Date of stay: June 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Madrid, Spain",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonspencer

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Daniel S wrote a review Jun 2019,20,Don't go,I have just stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in connection with a conference and it was an incredibly bad experience. The hotel wa booked through one of the conference-hired agencies and I have received a booking receipt but upon arrival the hotel cannot find me in the system and my check-in ends up taking almost 1 hour. (This problem can of course be due to a misunderstanding between the agency and the hotel but the next few experiences may not). On the second day in connection with a break in conference I wanted to go up to my room but now my key card does not work. I approach the reception and get notified that I have only booked 1 night I explain that it is not correct and even though the receptionist seems incredibly indifferent it eventually ends up with my key being opened again.    4 hours later the conference is finished for the day and we have an hour and a half before we have to meet again and go for a gala dinner so I have to get up to my room and get ready but again my key card has been closed. I approach the reception and get notified that there is a problem with the system and I just have to wait 2 min. However it soon becomes clear that the receptionist did not speak the true and they obviously had done something wrong with my booking. I end up waiting for over 1 hour where at no time I had been told what the problem is and where everyone in the reception seems to be completely indifferent. first 8 min before I have to go to the planned gala dinner I get my key back (without an apology) and I end up only being able to run up and change my clothes I dont have ret time for a bath or anything because of the reception's incompetence.    When my conference is over the day after I have to go back to my room and again my card does not work. I must therefore go back to the reception (now the third time) and get the problem fixed. This time it only takes 5 minutes but it has still happened three times now.    Besides the problem with the room there were a number of things that were far below the expected standard of the hotel.    Upon arrival we (5 people) choose to eat some lunch at one of their restaurants. From we have ordered the food it took almost 45 minutes before the first got their food. The food is cold and only 2 people got their food. Only when they have eaten their food we others got our food which is also cold.    their breakfast is ok but nothing special. however they have chosen a concept where you cannot take coffee and juice yourself but instead have to wait for a waiter to bring it. The problem with it is that it can easily take 10 min from the time you have sat down with your food to the waiter comes and then it can easily take 15 min before your coffee finally comes.    The hotel also has a policy that waiter soda beer ect. must not be brought into the hotel. This even though there is a big supermarket in the same building as the hotel and the hotel itself does not have a mini market or similar. You can only get drinks at the hotel and in the room if you but it through roomservice or buy it at the bar. The biggest problem with this is that the hotel has set the prices incredibly high and in this way cheats you like the street vendors do. A soda in the supermarket costs about 5 while the hotel takes 50 it is 10 times more for the same product. It is absolutely outrageous and will never take place at a decent hotel.    It can also be sayed that the cleaning is mediocre there where blood on the ironing board and all the corners in the room were filled with hair and dirt.    I will never consider using this hotel again.,Date of stay: June 2019,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Helsingoer, Denmark",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanielStenskov

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,StuSO52 wrote a review Jun 2019,30,"Great Pool and Location, Poor Service",We visited the Savoy on a 4 night long weekend booking one of the suites overlooking the 'relaxing pool'. The room itself was huge and relatively clean the bed was comfortable and the air conditioning worked well.    The Hotel itself is well located near a number of good restaurants with entertainment such as Buddah Bar and Malak which is handy as the service in the hotel itself is pretty shocking. To give you an example we dined out on 3 occasions asking the concierge if they could book our tables each time. On 2 occasions they didn't bother to phone the restaurant so we turned up and each restaurant had no record of us... luckily they squeezed us in. The other restaurant was recommended by the concierge what they failed to tell us is that there were two and we turned up at the wrong one luckily again they managed to squeeze us in.    Avoid the Lounge Bar by the pool if you want a drink the service there is some of the slowest I've ever known. If you want a drink use the bar on the side and order directly.    The outdoor pool is lovely. If you're staying over the weekend or a holiday period be aware that the hotel is 80% occupied by French who are every bit as bad as the Germans when it comes to putting towels on loungers... you'll need to play the game and get your towels down before 8am to have a chance of a good spot.    I'm marking this as average. The shocking service didn't ruin our holiday just irritated us hence giving the hotel 3 stars.,Date of stay: June 2019,,"Southampton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StuSO52

But they serve a large selection of alcoholic drinks in the hotel!!l so this a commercial business decision and nothing to do with religion!  There is a bar/restaurant called Number 6 which is a 3 minute walk from the hotel go there! they serve alcohol!! .  I have never experienced a hotel in my life that does this only this one.    -Drinks and food is well over priced so we never ate in the hotel we always ate out its more exciting.Typically £9 for a pint of beer at the hotel!!    -Some of the waiters have very bad breath! so keep away when they speak to you.    -Some of the staff are moody especially the lady who makes the coffee/tea for you behind the counter.    -The waiters bring tea/coffee to you only it takes so long to get your drinks.  We waited more than10 minutes for a drink. When i visited the serving station the lady was very moody and snapped at me!  They dont have any tea spoons on the table with the cups we had to ask everyday for a week for teaspoons so i could stir my tea with sugar. Non of the tables have any type of spoons.Very strange set up.

Rest is for a good 4* hotel. We started with bad experiance. We had very late arrival and we decided for overpricedpick up arranged by hotel. We were very surprised that no one showed up. So we took local taxi that was OK but you need to bargain of course. We had very good check in experiance. It took some time but staff was very kind. Also they escorted us to the room. Room itself is really big and very conformable. We were only missing minibarthat was empty. Breakfast area is big and selection is good. Pool area is nice but some improvements are possible. Best place to stay in the pool is close to the entrance to mall. Sun stay the longest there. But unfortunately in this area air-condition is very loud so I would recommend to install some speakers for music in this area. It's very convenient that hotel is connected to mall with a big Carfoor supermarket.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Mary D wrote a review May 2019,20,Not a 5-star experience in any way,If you are looking for a 5-star luxury trip looks elsewhere (Four Seasons or La Mamounia- we ended up going to both to eat drink and hang out). This is extremely off-brand for Savoy with horrible customer service and probably a 2-3 star facility at best. The only positives were the pool and a lovely gentleman working at the spa who was at this hotel on a rotational program from the Savoy in Egypt. In the negative category is absolutely everything else. The food and drinks were mediocre the concierge was extremely unhelpful and misled us on what our day trip/tours were going to be the timelines we should expect (ex: “oh it’s a 45 min drive” when in reality it was 2+ hours) and all of the staff spoke very limited English. When we had an issue with one of our excursions they tried to blame us and not give us a refund despite having already promised to refund in full. They also gave us the wrong rooms (we explicitly booked two next to each their and had not only requested in our booking but also called to confirm this. When we arrived the hotel was not close to filled and when we asked if the rooms were next to eachother they just said “nearby” (when we looked they were on different floors). The rooms themselves were clean and perfectly fine but dated with paint falling off walls and the doors don’t shut properly without slamming them. The gym was very hot (no AC) and there is no on-site store to buy water or sunscreen. There was a mall nearby but it was only open for a few hours in the day and after 9pm at night. Overall I am glad we got this hotel for a low price because it wasn’t even worth the money we spent. If i return to Marrakech I’ll be staying elsewhere and would recommend anyone looking for a customer-centric and luxury experience look elsewhere as well.,Date of stay: May 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_itsamadworld_travel
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Love_Travels_2015 wrote a review May 2019,30,Okay...,So I came to this hotel with my husband and baby. Firstly the taxis from the airport are such con's. They charge 200 but should be less than 100 max. So don't be fooled.    Arriving at the hotel everything looked fine.  We were in a garden view room which had welcome decorations and at first looked nice...    The room itself was big and long. But don't expect privacy on the balcony... especially if someone is next door. You are literally so close it's uncomfortable! What made this worse was the people at savoy knew we had a baby but placed us with people smoking on both sides of the balcony. So the balcony wasn't much use as smoke could be breathed  everywhere. My poor baby!    Also there was a big problem with the ac! It wouldn't work and my baby was heating up. This was extremely stressful. After much arguments and bs excuses from the staff we finally had the ac checked and refitted with a new filter. This made the room more cooler and liveable. You really need to badger them or else they don't do anything!    The safe also broke too!! so more frustration. However someone eventually came to fix it that day.    The bathroom was nice but no bath tub so it was a  little bit tricky to bath baby. Used the shower head which had good temp control.    House keeping were nice and came every morning but were very reluctant to give more than 3 bottles of water for me my husband and to make baby formula! In the end I went to the supermarket next door and purchased few 2l bottles for 50p each.    Breakfast wise... Hmmm... Everyone has commented on how good it is?? But honestly either they don't each much or not been to a proper buffet brekkiee. Everything Was so less. The hot stuff consisted of only boiled eggs. Potato croquets. Creamy mushrooms and grilled tomato. Now that definitely isn't wow. The fruits were looking old and rotten. I definitely wouldn't rate on the breakfast.    One thing I really liked about savoy though was how close it was to the mall. Like literally next door! This was useful to buy baby essentials like mentioned bottled water and food. We had no issues bringing food in. After all they can't exactly deny a baby food can they now? Also I used the rear entrance pool side to enter the hotel so not many security guards to interrogate.    There was a large indoor heated pool which was fab for babies. I could take my little one swimming everyday without fearing of getting cold. This was probably the best bit about savoy...    The koutbia mosque and jamaa el fanaa was about a 30 minute walk but I don't advise doing this with kids. It's so hot! Best to take a taxi.    Overall for a family with kids this hotel is suitable but I wouldn't say much more than that.    Oh forgot to add buy a few travel adapters when you go!,Date of stay: April 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,United Kingdom,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Love_Travels_2015

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,RalphUtrecht wrote a review May 2019,30,"Great hotel, party public",The savoy has a great lobby two great pools and superb rooms. Spaceous wel equipped. Dinner options are relatively limited and pricey and we did not appreciate the fact that the live music was hindering a proper conversation.  In general the hotels aims to be a kind of Vegas-style casino hotel with dancemusic and chicha pipes around the large central pool. This also attracts the corresponding tattoo’d audience. Different than we expected when booking a Savoy. I would use this hotel as gateway to the airport but not for its athmospere or access to Marrakesh medina.,Date of stay: May 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Utrecht,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RalphUtrecht

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,DorisT5 wrote a review May 2019,50,"Beautiful Hotel, calm oasis away from the hustle and bustle",We had a four day break here and loved it. The hotel is spotlessly clean the staff are very polite and helpful the rooms are spacious the maid comes everyday the pool was fabulous and the breakfast was amazing. The hotel is attached to the mall which is has a number of shops and restaurants. There is a Carrefour next door but no alchol for sale. The Jema el fna square is a twenty minute walk away apparently but we never attempted it in the heat. Taxis from the hotel were easy enough to get. The conceirge would tell us the price but the taxis drivers always asked for more so agree your price before you get in we paid anything from 50 diram to 100 diram. Firiq the concierge was brilliant he gave us loads of help. Furnished us with a map and marked points of interest and recommended a couple of amazing restaurants and made the bookings for us. The spa was amazing we had the soul massage and it was far better than the description given legs back shoulders and arms. Absolutely would recommend staying here and if we ever venture back to Marrakech we would definitely book The Savoy again.,Date of stay: May 2019,,"Southampton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DorisT5

Pool is cold but what you need when it’s super warm and sunny. Plenty of beds by the pool - prices are too expensive poolside which is disappointing.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,yesyoli wrote a review May 2019,50,Nice place to stay,We only stayed for the evening because we were arriving so late in the evening that we thought it would be easier to check in and it’s close to the airport.  It’s a lovely property that provides all your vacation needs with a door that takes you straight into a small mall with a few food options and shopping.  We had a lovely breakfast that was included with our stay.  If there was anything that I wish was different it would be a clearer process when checking in. And it might have only been our experience so I didn’t take any points off the overall stay.  We had booked our night online and received a confirmation. But when we wrote them to ask about airport transfers and other items we never heard back. Upon our arrival we were told our reservation had been cancelled due to our fault for not confirming. We were lucky that we had the confirmation email available and it probably wouldn’t have been an issue as there seemed to be rooms available. I just thought it would have been nice to have received something from the hotel about cancelling or a response about our email. I’m willing to call it a possible glitch and say that I would recommend the hotel for a relaxing stay!,Date of stay: May 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Chula Vista, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yesyoli

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Lauren S wrote a review May 2019,30,Pretty but not the Savoy as you know it,This hotel is pretty (on the inside) clean and has good services like a gym spa etc. However don't go here expecting the real Savoy treatment.  Before arriving I emailed the hotel 4 times to tell them that we would arrive at 10am and would require early check-in. I had no response and we weren't allowed to check in until 3pm so had to sit in reception for 5 hours (it was 40 degrees and didn't fancy going out with leggings and a jumper on). Also customer service is NOT one of the hotel's strong points - the staff at breakfast are slow abrupt and not very attentive.  My favourite part of the hotel experience was the accessibility of sun beds and the piano player in the bar at night.,Date of stay: May 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Q6792JAlaurens
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,mandymib wrote a review May 2019,30,Forgotten Pool Needs Love,A lovely hotel in a good location with two pools.  The main pool is fabulous with different styles of seating however the quiet pool should be renamed the forgotten pool the beds are not cleaned and often have bird poop on them the umbrellas are all broken and a lot don't work at all of the 6 large cantilever umbrellas only one actually works. The pool waiters only come around to skive in the unused bar at the rear and don't stop to ask if you want a drink.  Drinks are very expensive with a can of coke costing 50 dirham which is about £4 and the same for 750ml of water. You are not allowed to bring food or drink into the hotel and even if you are walking in with a bottle of water from walking around you are subjected to overly assertive reprimand and requests to leave the offending items outside or use them before entering the hotel  I read my booking there is no mention that you can't drink your duty free or buy a bottle of water at the store next door this is just a ploy to get guests to pay 50 dirham for the same coke that is 6 dirham next door I understand fully that these things cost more in a hotel but the inflated price is a little to much and the absurd ban on food or drink from outside of the hotel just ridiculous. I admit I am a rebel I smuggled in a chocolate bar last night  Shame about the forgotten pool it really is quite a lovely peaceful area and the ridiculous rule on the food ban the hotel is quite lovely otherwise and staff are really friendly,Date of stay: May 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Bristol, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mandymib

I hope the management commend her as she is clearly a valuable member of the team who genuinely cares about the hotels guests.  The hotel it self is beautiful well kept and clean. The hotel food is good in fact this was my 3rd time in Marrakech and the food at the Savoy was by far the best I've tasted from other hotels. The breakfast was good with lots of choices.  The hotel rooms are beautiful and well thought out and the grounds are stunning with plenty of sunbeds with different variations. The pools are great too and again well thought out. Even though it was Ramadan the staff kept smiling and worked hard to please guest through the very hot sunshine.  The Savoy Marrakech is now my place to stay when visiting Marrakech which hopefully will be very soon. The location is also the best as it's within walking distance to the Medina and the old town.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,GandtheP wrote a review May 2019,40,Beautiful hotel & friendly staff,We stayed 5 nights at the Savoy Le Grand arriving on the eve of Ramadan. The staff were all friendly smiley and very helpful. I hear the first few days of Ramadan are the toughest and the team at the Savoy Le Grande we’re unflinching with their friendliness and energy. Service wasnt always quick or overly attentive but it was always with a smile and conversation - this is something we found reflected across the city (people are just relaxed here considering we are on holiday and have plenty of time it was nice to go at a slower pace). The hotel grounds and pools are beautiful the sunbeds in the pool are a nice touch and where I spent most of my days. The water is cold but when the temperature is pushing plus 32 degrees (and you’ve been baking in the sun) you wouldn’t want it any other way. The room itself was spacious clean and we had everything we could want. Some of the parasols looked a little tired and need fixing or replacing and due to coming out of season not all the facilities are open such as all the pool bars or restaurants. I’m not sure I’d call it a 5 star but it’s definitely a very good 4 star and we had a fantastic time.,Date of stay: May 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Walthamstow, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gatp19

And God forbid if you walk in with a female me and my fiancé were constantky harraased every day by staff and security asking who we were and what room number.... every day and I was there for 7 nights all we wanted to do was use the hotel restaurant and my fiancé was made to feel like a prostitute by staff. It got so bad my partner refused to enter the hotel and just waited for me outside.    ROOM - the hallway to the room smelled like dirty socks.... God knows how old the carpet is but it stunk. Once upon entering the room it smelled no better it actually smelled like a toilet. Keep in mind this a 5 star hotel... supposedly. Stayed all over the globe and never smelled a 5 star hotel so bad.    ROOM SERVICE - I wanted milk for my tea called 3 days and waited 3 days it never came. Had to go to the supermarket next door. Calling the room sercive team they sounded like they wanted to be anywhere but there most blunt and lazy tone you'll hear it was actually funny. Lol    Bella Lounge - had to wait 30 minutes to be served and this was after getting up twice to be asked to be served. I ordered a shisha smoothie & dessert for 2. After 45 minutes of waiting i approached a lady who I believe was the manager and said their is onky 5 other customers and I have ordered shisha and its been 40 minutes her reply was ""I know you have ordered it. Its coming"" lol after an hour of waiting i left for another hookah bar Mandaloun and the shisha came within 10 minutes. The Smoothie was like water & the dessert was cheap. Staff and manager were really inattentive.    Upom leaving I was furious mainly at how my partner was approached every day and made to feel like a criminal I spoke to the manager who apologised seemed genuine and gave me her e-mail and said the next time I book she would make it up to me and upgrade me as I am a constant visitor in Marrakech. I e-mailed and messaged a few times to no reply. So it was all a charade in front of other customers.    Overall it's a beautiful hotel rooms smell breakfast 5/10 room service is poor.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Lila wrote a review Apr 2019,10,Worst hotel ever,First of all we were greeted by incompetent reception staff who declined credit cards to secure the room but was very eager to have cash instead she asked us for 8000 DH in advance claiming that it’s a regular measure just to secure the room and we will refunded our money at the end of the stay deducting only the room price and any extra charges should they incurred. We agreed as we had no reason not to trust them and paid 6000DH and planned to pay the rest as soon as we settle.All checks were done we were given the card to the room once we open the door there goes the surprise we booked a twin room but the room was double bed we complained straight away!!! Only to be faced with further non professional staff and a bunch of crooks Who simply thought it was okay to put a folded bed kids size in the room and they claimed that they are overbooked so they can not accommodate our choice although that’s what we booked and paid for. After long phone calls to hotel.com they have managed to relocate us so we went to reception to check out and here is the nasty surprise!!!! *Sorry we cashed your money* said the reception staff and we can’t refund you anything !!!! To cut the story short we have been ripped off full stop!!! So we were obliged to stay since they have taken our money. We realised the stupid mistake we have done WE PAID CASH!!! Never ever pay in cash in this hotel and make sure you double check the night rate as we agreed to pay €259 per night instead we were charged over €300 we checked out after 2 nights and paid 6800DH.  BEWARE THIS IS NOT PART OF THE SAVOY WORLDWIDE FRANCHISE which we thought it was with the kind of the rates they have.  The head of management bluntly said we are sorry but we can’t offer any refund back.  And last but not least I have to mention the guest relation manager who thought it was okay to swear in front of guests and was happy to say that THIS IS MOROCCO WHATEVER MONEY COMES IN DOESNT COME OUT!!!

Rafik the concierge is very courteous and spoke perfect English he was very patient and always good at recommending places to visit. The hotel is confortable quiet and perfect for a relaxing week. I would have given it five stars has not been the slow response to some of the mistakes that taken place when we arrived. We booked the suite for five and only provided bedding for four! I had to ask several times for them to bring bedding extra water and towels! My son had to sleep on the sofa not a bed sofa at the end as the matrix provided looked grabby. I had no apologies or discussion from management despite my ask to see the manager.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,umera a wrote a review Apr 2019,50,Amazing break,We came to Marrakech for the third time but this was our second time staying here and this time we wanted to celebrate our daughter’s first birthday.    On arrival we were welcomed by Zahira and Marwane who were so lovely to our daughter so much so she put her arms out fo be held and they played with her. We checked in and we were welcomed in our room with Happy Birthday Pillows and bed runner with petals later on we were also gifted a beautiful cake to enjoy!    We love the hotel for the cleanliness. The staff are lovely and constantly cleaning outside.    Breakfast was amazing just like last time and Kaosar was particularly attentive towards us aswell as making our daughter smile each morning. She was a very kind and hardworking staff member and we want to thank her especially for this.    In terms of using the facilities we enjoyed spa treatments. My husband treated me to full body massage twice and facial. The prices are quite high but you get more then you pay for the spa menu needs more description. For example a back massage includes head and legs so you do get a lovely treatment at the comfort on your hotel which was idea for me to go back to my room and swap with the hubby to have his treatment.    The hotel is next to all the restaurants and the mall is lovely if you fancy a coffee or ice cream. My husband particularly loved the barbers there and I loved my pedicure at the salon also however staff at savoy spa were a lot more pleasant.    We had lunch at the pool and the food is amazing.    The swimming pool was very cold and this was a huge negative as we wanted our baby to enjoy this but the service we got meant we would obviously stay again and would book here in a heartbeat.    We sadly did not see Morad this time round but hope to see him again we did try to contact him before coming but again we can see him next time.

There was an abundance in choice for the buffet breakfast and the service was wonderful! All staff were friendly and helpful in answering any questions we had.  The only slight issue I had was when I brought a pizza back to the hotel one of the security men wouldn’t allow me to take it back to my room. Due to the language barrier he took me to two of the people at the front desk of the hotel but they apologised and said that it wasn’t an issue to take my pizza up.

We love everything about this property. It's a short taxi ride from the airport and a perfect distance from the craziness of Medina (old town).    We were enthusiastically and professionally greeted at reception (thanks Touria!) and quickly taken to our room. The room is luxurious -- I can't think of a more fitting word. It's spotlessly clean well-appointed and it has all the essentials necessary for a comfortable stay.    The hotel is adjacent to a large shopping mall with international brands. The workout facility has four (4) treadmills ellipticals and various weight machines.    Taxis are plentifully available around the clock. There's an ATM in the lobby.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,E15ASF wrote a review Mar 2019,50,Absolutely amazing hotel,The Savoy has to be one of the best hotels I’ve ever stayed at. While I’m not a seasoned traveller/tourist I have traveled enough to know a great hotel when I stay at one.    From the moment you walk into the main lobby you know that you’ll have an amazing stay. A huge grand traditional Moroccan lobby area welcomes you to hotel. This is then followed by the pool area and the restaurants.    The hotel rooms are then located at the rear and side of the hotel.    The Savoy benefits from a lovely spa in the basement with three separate climatised and heated pools including a kids pool.    Clean and spacious rooms with room service daily. The main street outside has a row of restaurants to choose from and there’s also a huge supermarket next to the hotel.    Bahia Palace Jamaa el Fenaa and the old Jewish Quarters are also a short taxi ride from the hotel.    I would highly recommend this hotel to anybody staying in Marrakech. You will not be disappointed.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Nd87 wrote a review Mar 2019,20,The Luxury of this hotel is only skin deep,First impressions when you arrive at the hotel are great grand foyer beautiful pool area and huge suite. Unfortunately it’s let down by the staff / service and amenities.    Our room looked great to start but it’s rough around the edges the tap in the bath didn’t work so had to fill it with the shower head we complained to reception and they said they would send maintenance over 3 days we were told 4 times that the engineer couldn’t find a fault finally he came to the room when we were there and I showed him the broken tap turns out he thought it was totally acceptable to fill the bath with a shower head. Totally useless.    We also told the reception that our minibar was empty they didn’t fix it. From reading other reviews it appears that others had the same issue.    Twice our room wasn’t cleaned during the day the second time we asked at reception in the evening they sent someone and they half-assed it.    The pool area looks great but you will find nobody in the pool it’s freeeezing. When we were there it was 28 degrees outside and the pool was a freezing 19 degrees. Most people just would dip their feet in it and that was enough! Prices round the pool are crazy too a coke is almost £5    Breakfast had a good choice but on two occasions we were sat at dirty tables with no cutlery the staff member walked off and didn’t come back it was hit of miss if you were able to get someone’s attention to get orange juice and a coffee.    Overall whilst this hotel looks great at first glance I wouldn’t recommend it from the service we received.,Date of stay: March 2019,,"Milton Keynes, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nd87

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Wander790286 wrote a review Mar 2019,40,"Fabulous Location, Charming Staff, Scalding / Freezing Showers",We stayed in 2 separate rooms for a week for a well needed family break. Jamal one of the Bell Boys/ Porter was incredibly helpful and helped to make our trip very hospitable as did Imane the Hotel’s Reception Manager. We booked a Walking Food Tour with the Concierge; which wasn’t executed as described. We had to pay for travel into the Medina which we had not been told about when booking and then were provided with the equivalent of a sandwich as our evening meal after we’d been told we would have a meal to conclude the tour. For 300 Durham’s per person (£24.00) which for the 4 of us was (£96.00) this was a real rip off considering the 4 of us could have a Tagine Meal with all the trimmings for £50.00 equivalent. On a happier note the breakfast selection was amazing and we looked forward to it daily.  The rooms were okay and the cleaning staff did a great job cleaning up daily. However the showers in both rooms were very bad. They couldn’t be regulated so the water was either scalding hot or freezing cold!,Date of stay: March 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wander790286

I've stayed at Savoy 4 times..So in a nutshell here's my review.  -Pros  Huge graduation pool  Huge bedroom and shower room  Rooms at spotless  Rooms have a ironing board and safe and tea/coffee/minibar/fridge  Good choice of breakfast  Great location  Hotel ground are very clean and tidy  Great variety of sun-loungers beds poolside sofas etc  Good choice of lunch  Has a poolside Dj playing Beyoncé Rihanna Sean Paul and chart hits  Very friendly staff Zahira and especially Mourad the Guest relation manager  Menara mall is next door so if you've left anything at home you can find it in the supermarket in the mall.  They have a great spa sauna jacuzzi indoor pool hammam etc (extra to use)  The Guest relation manager Mourad was so helpful in getting me checked in quickly and also i asked for the same room i had last time and he made sure i had it.    -Cons    There is no hair conditioner in the bathroom. Only a two in one which didn't nourish my hair    The hairdryer isn't that powerful (for long hair) so take your own.    I found the pool staff a bit chatty and not observant therefore missing my hand that I kept raising for my bill. Took 10mins.    Checking in/out takes a very long time they don't have enough staff i guess on the desk    Biggest downfall the tea and coffee and milk does not get replenished at all like most basic hotels do. I phones housekeeping for one milk (as there wasn't any in 2 days) she said No you have to pay 40 dhirams (which is approx £3) so buy your own small milk carton from the Carrefore supermarket from next door.    -Overall  I would definitely stay here again.,Date of stay: February 2019,Trip type: Traveled solo,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MissVirdee

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Domenico S wrote a review Feb 2019,30,5 stars not fully earned yet,I have to make a premise: although traveling a lot and having a good knowledge of the hotel world in general I have no comparison to Morocco having only stayed here.The hotel is very nice with a large huge central pool and other pools indoor and outdoor. There is a spa. However rooms as well as room services are ordinary suitable for a 4-star hotel. In addition despite being a 5-star hotel there isn't a good variety of restaurants: I counted a couple one Italian. The hotel location is not far from the city center (Medina and Jemaa el-Fnaa square). To me they even messed up with the payments because they had not understood each other with my travel agency and pretended that I would pay the price of accommodation that had already been paid (but sometimes can happen I guess). Among other things it does not seem to me cheap either. So summing up:it has good potential but for a 5-star hotel your expectation are much much higher.It looks more like a good 4-star,Date of stay: February 2019,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Cairo, Egypt",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Domenicosid

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Sue from Yorkshire wrote a review Feb 2019,50,Helpful and caring in a difficult situation,I booked this hotel due to reviews and good disabled access as I needed to care for my son when he was discharged from hospital following surgery after an accident when he arrived at the airport. The staff have been very kind  thoughtful and descrete. Initially he was unable to walk and was swathed in head bandages they helped us locate a nurse to care for his surgical wounds found us taxis to return to the hospital for repeated scans. They all even the domestic cleaning staff speak English as my French is very weak. The room is kept spotless vital for him. Double beds X2 in the room dining could share the room to care and monitor him. I have managed to find vegetarian food mainly cheese and eggs portion sizes are large but the children's sizes sent when requested. We have been here for 3 weeks now sadly the morrocan restaurant is still not open so no tagines. WiFi excellent but poor choice in English films but I could use my Netflix account on my laptop without buffering. Security is very good . Facilities swimming pools which are cold outside but heated one is ok. Families catered for if you want lots of peace ask to be located in that area as main pool has muzac 10am to 7pm. Hoping to be repatriated this week now his scans are ok.,Date of stay: January 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rainbowsue
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,grumpyroadie wrote a review Feb 2019,40,Two trips,Second time here in a month. As normal an outstanding welcome and to be remembered and shown straight to our room. Unsure how this happened but we were put in to the same room we had three weeks earlier.  The room is clean well appointed and with all the amenities you require. Being at the rear of the hotel room 3611 is away from the coming and going of the main hotel areas and is very quiet.    The only downside to using the pool at the rear is there is no pool side service you have to collect you own drinks and food.,Date of stay: September 2018,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Irthlingborough, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/grumpyroadie

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Simon P wrote a review Feb 2019,10,Break in at room in the middle of the night,"A few weeks ago I arrived at Savoy Le Grand Hotel Marrakech with a broken leg from an ambulance from a hospital in order to spend a single night before my flight home to Europe. The receptionist was extremely welcoming and helpful got me a wheel chair and along with another member of staff helped me to my room at the ground floor in the court yard nearest the reception. It was a very warm welcome - and the good friendly service was retained through to the restaurant etc.  My leg was painful and kept me awake until 03:00 but at 03:30 I woke up by sounds coming from the balcony door. Someone had broken up the door and was in my room I started shouting of the intruder and he got startled and ran off knocking over a lamp on the way out. I jumped on my good leg to the door and closed it and then called the reception to inform them. They told me they would contact security look into the matter and get back to me. I was shocked and felt very exposed having a broken leg and especially worried after the murder of 2 Scandinavian tourists nearby a few weeks ago. 25 minutes passed and I impatiently gave them a call to ask for a status. The nightmanager at the reception told me ""Oh it was just a technician looking to fix something on your balcony"". I repeated that the intruder had been in my room and it wasnt a technician. He continued saying the technician might have opened the door to do maintenance and ""we apologizing for disturbing your sleep"" -and we argued a bit back and forth as there was no way in the world that was a technician sneaking into an occupied room at 03:30. An hour later I fell asleep exhausted after 24 hours without much sleep but very very worried.  The next morning I went in wheel chair to the reception to settle the bill and check out - and after that I asked to talked to the manager. I wanted a senior staff to know what was going on at the hotel and 2 managers emerged. I told them the story and the senior manager replied ""That was not a technician"" as in no staff would have an assignment that required sneaking into a guest room in the middle of the night. He said he would look into the matter and gave me his card so I could contact him the next day. Two days after I wrote him a mail but no reply emerged so called the hotel a few times a couple of days later and finally got hold of him. He promised me he would get back to me but more than a week after I have yet to hear from them about the break in.  All in all it seems like Savoy Le Grand Hotel Marrakech has serious issues with security and takes it pretty lightly or wanna sweep it under the rug instead of handling it. That for me is pretty unnerving and if you wanna feel secure in your room at night this is not the hotel for you.",Date of stay: January 2019,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Copenhagen, Denmark",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/simonp572

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,taurus12788 wrote a review Feb 2019,40,Nice,Quick check in . Everyone in lobby was nice . Money exchange counter available . Wifi strong everywhere except your actual room. Rooms are large with nice large showers . Breakfast had large selections of lunch meats if you like that sort of food. We dont but were happy they had a omelette station . Ate at the Italian restaurant one time and then the lounge one time . Everyone was friendly . Always empty . Food was jus ok. We decided to eat off the resort at the restaurants just out front as they had more options at half the cost . Pool was nice to look at but too cold to get in. Hotel is attached to mall which is nice. We never had anyone check our bags when we returned. We brought water at the market in front of the restaurants as the ones provided in the rooms were overpriced . Everyone spoke enough english to understand us . Rooms cleaned daily. We had a late flight and was not allowed late check out .However they did watch our luggage while we continued to explore the city until out transfer picked us up later that evening . Hotel provided us with a converter adapter to plug our phones in . Taxis lined up outside gate of hotel awaiting to take you whereEver for a low price . The square is literally down the street and is about a 20 minute walk in one direction. We went to the souks but realized the souvenir shop in the menera mall sold the same things for the same price . Overall. I would recommend this hotel .

We’ve been visiting the city for over 5 years now and this is the nicest hotel we’ve found.    Special mentions to receptionist Touria and concierge Abdelkabir. Their service and general friendly manner is a pleasure. They truly are a credit to the hotel.    Food was good drinks good. Service is good we never found it slow like other reviews suggest.    One for travellers taxi here from airport should be circa 100 dh - don’t let the taxi con you!  Location good with some nice options for eating just outside and a short enough walk into town centre or 150 dh for a caleche back. So in short this place is great clean friendly staff (not sure who cleaner for my room was - but if manager read this please pass on how good she was).

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Angelica P wrote a review Feb 2019,10,Absolutely Appalling Service & Lack of Care,I’ve stayed in budget accomodation with better service then this place. This was the second stay for my friend and I within a week a part. We had booked two standard rooms for the first stay for 3 nights it wasn’t amazing but it was clean had a great location and was fitted with all the amenities we needed.    Our second stay we booked for an over night stay which we wanted to use as a resting point between driving from the Sahara to our next city. I decided to upgrade both our rooms to a one-bedroom suite we wanted to ensure that we both had a good nights rest for more driving the next day! Big mistake...    We arrived at the hotel around 9 pm. Looking tired and exhausted I had requested that we get the ‘best’ remaining one bedroom suites as we had been on a long trip and that they were in close proximity to each other. Both the rooms were on the first level in the main building. As soon as I got into the room I ordered room service and popped into the shower. As I had finished my shower I noticed a washing machine type background noise that was vibrating some walls and the floor. I was so tired that I just didn’t give a second thought to it and that it would eventually just stop. My room service came around 15 min later. After having ‘some’ of my dinner I began to get irritated as the noise wasn’t stopping. I called the front desk which took another 20 min to get through to someone. They sent maintenance to come and check the noise. Once maintenace came I didn’t even need to say one word before she said ‘yes we already know about this room - it is noisy . Call front desk and they will change your room’. What on earth? They clearly already knew about this issue  yet still putting paying customers in a room that has a ridiculously irritating noise. I called front desk which was another 10 min wait for someone to pick up the bloody phone. I expressed to her how tired I was and how much inconvenience this has caused as I now had to pack my bags again and the only thing she could say was ‘what did you want me to do about it? Call me when you’re finished packing’ . And it doesn’t get any better from here .    Ordered breakfast after a short sleep and a cold dinner expecting it to be what was written on the menu. English breakfast - sausage fake bacon eggs mushroom baked potatoes tomatoes yum and just what I needed! I got none of that . What I got was egg with some leaves muesli cold meats. and cheese?    Completely disgusted with our one nights stay I requested to speak to the front desk manager upon checkout. Waited 20 min to speak to her only for her to say that they don’t offer any compensation for our nights stay ‘perhaps a late check out’ with our bags packed and car waiting at the front... I raised the issue with the breakfast .. no apology given .. instead she took a photo of my photos of the menu indirectly implying I was lying and went to go speak with someone else. Not satisfied with this managers service I then requested to speak to the general manager.    Another 20 min wait ... and he appears. He apologised for our nights stay and breakfast which was nice but once I asked to be compensated he brought out the most offensive remark of all ‘you only booked economy rooms?’ Wow Unbelievable! Besides the point that you should be treating every customer equally whether or not they’re apparently graded in cattle class - I paid for TWO suites. I paid for a good nights sleep service and convenience. I did not pay to be treated as a liar a lower classed guest or literally have all the time in the world to wait for your incompetent staff to answer the phone or attend to a complaint. After all this he proposed lunch as compensation ... yes indeed it was time for lunch after making us wait 1.5 hours to speak to a manager for compensation. After promising to at least compensate me for my breakfast and after speaking with several people that I was in fact correct it was still charged to my final bill upon check out which I had to explain the story yet again haha. Thank you for leaving a bad taste in my mouth.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,LesFlamantsRoses wrote a review Jan 2019,30,Reasonable hotel - but lamentable check in,Our arrival was overshadowed by a protracted and convoluted check in where the clerk (who appeared to be undergoing training but who also declined support from colleagues) appeared unable to comprehend an earlier cancelled booking which had been replaced by a shorter booking. We were sent to sit down four times over a period close to 40 minutes and repeatedly recalled to the desk where he repeated redundant phrases of no relevance and when we expressed growing irritation he then appeared to blame us for the earlier booking!    That apart our accommodation was comfortable and the facilities were good. Breakfast was very good but there was an over-abundance of staff hanging around in conversation with each other and yet pretty unaware of what was going on. As a consequence getting basics such as hot drinks and teaspoons took too long.    One final note - the accounting was way over complicated; part of the account was debited by Prestigia the remaining figures being a mass of confusion entailing credit card blocks against future additional charges placed alongside supplementary accommodation costs with various taxes.,Date of stay: January 2019,,"Altrincham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LesFlamantsRoses

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Eugiegirl wrote a review Jan 2019,20,"Zero customer service, NOISY hotel, total rip off - do not stay!",My boyfriend and I booked this place quite last minute for a 3 night stay over new year’s.  I am frankly puzzled that this hotel has been awarded a Trip Advisor certificate of excellence in 2018 because honestly - I have stayed in 5 star hotels all around the world and I can say with hand on heart that I have never experienced such appalling service as I did at the Savoy Le Grand!  First of all everything was just incredibly S L O O O W! 20 mins wait just to speak to a reception clerk to check in. Admittedly we arrived a few hours before check in time and our room wasn’t ready. But we were told to come back in an hour and when we did receptionist told us to sit in the waiting area “for a minute” until she checked with housekeeping if our room was ready then basically forgot about us. We could see that she was serving other guests! Another 20 minute wait followed before finally we had enough and marched up to the check in desk at which point a room key magically appeared - has she been sitting on it the whole time? Why not walk over and hand us the key? That is the difference between a real 5 star hotel and this place.  The room we got was right next to the (loud) lifts. As soon as the bellboy left I called reception and asked to change room. Reception said no problem we can give you another room the bell boy will be right over to move your luggage. Again - a 20 minute wait followed at which point still nothing happened and finally we had to trek back to reception to remind them that they’d promised us a different room.  I can maybe survive 3 nights of poor service especially as we only had breakfast at the hotel and no other meals but the worst thing about this hotel is the constant NOISE! While the walls seem to have some soundproofing the doors lack it entirely!  For 3 days we endured loud door slamming from multiple families next door who seemed to be running from room to room slamming doors every 10 mins and standing chatting right outside our door. Same goes for housekeeping who completely lack any sort of respect for your sleep and start moving around furniture in neighbouring rooms at 8:30am making screeching sounds on the hard stone floor and again talking really loudly and aggressively we even had to come out several times and actually shush them - I’ve never done this in any other hotel!  We complained to reception multiple times and they said they have spoken to the families but still - nothing changed. The door slamming continued and we were kept awake until 2am one night and woken up again at 8:30am when the slamming resumed (did those people even sleep?)  Kudos to the manager Khalid who came to our room to speak about the issue. However nothing was offered to alleviate or make up for the problem - even a suggestion to move us to a different room or 2 free drinks in the bar at the very least.  Finally room service was incredibly slow. 20 min wait for 2 tonics and a bucket of ice. Another 20 min wait for 2 bottles of still water on new year’s day... I repeated my order for STILL water twice on the phone and the lady repeated my order yet 2 bottles of sparkling water arrived and the waiter even tried to argue with me.  When it was time to check out we didn’t even bother waiting for the bell boy and dragged our bags to the taxi ourselves.  Clientele at this hotel is loud and unreasonably obnoxious.  Also hotel starts playing loud house music at about 5pm - incredibly annoying if you are trying to have a nap before dinner. Combined with the constant door slamming just made for a nightmarish stay!    Pros:  Nice pool area  Great/helpful concierge who helped ring around several restaurants for us  Breakfast was ok  Good location,Date of stay: December 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eugiegirl
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,simontaH3bR wrote a review Jan 2019,10,WORST hotel I've stayed at EVER!,I needed a nice place to stay at short notice and through a couple of websites I was pointed to this property with the attraction of a last minute rate. I booked a junior suite which I have to say was very nice. My complaints however are as follows:    - The room (1102) location was appalling. A LONG way from reception at the back fo the hotel above a loud generator(?) and what seemed to be the staff entrance where employees would stand outside smoking and talking loudly throughout the night. I assume these poor rooms are given to booking.com customers but it’s really not acceptable.    - Staff were nearly without exception disinterested unhelpful and in one case downright rude. Apart from the young lady who checked me out this morning (Moumha - who was lovely and helpful) nobody cared about helping me. I was constantly met with ‘no’ or ‘we can’t do that’ to very simple requests. Not what I expect from a 5* hotel.    - A letter is put in rooms advising guests that to beat long queues on check-out day to pre-pay in advance but when you go to reception to do this they say you can’t. Another guest asked the same thing an hour later (whilst I was still waiting for assistance and was told the same).    - There are simply not enough staff. I queued to check-in I queued again for concierge I called reception numerous times in the evening to complain about the temperature in the room and the phone was never answered except once when I was instantly hung up on.    - The hotel charges 300Dh (£30/$30) for an airport shuttle!!! That is atrocious and downright criminal. I later found out I could simply take a taxi from the front door for 100Dh but the fact the concierge would only tell me about the 300Dh option is wrong.    I could also complain about 70Dh (£7/$7) for a beer at your bar but I guess you have a captive market there as you forbid guests bringing in their own drink (something I’ve never seen before in 20 years of 5* travelling).    Despite contacting the hotel before reviewing they didn't reply.,Date of stay: January 2019,Trip type: Traveled solo,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/simontaH3bR
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,FamilyH wrote a review Jan 2019,10,Far from 5 star experience - Loin d'être un 5 étoiles,We came to Savoy with family and we were extremely disappointed.    Regarding accommodations - Despite an entrance hotel where I think the hotel owner has invested all his budget the rooms are cheap bathrooms seem to be used since 20 years all the materials are very cheap. Moreover we came to rest and we were between two rooms of people making noise all night long. Despite the fact that we warned the management team of the hotel we were left in the room suffering the situation 2 nights in a row. NO compensation or commercial gesture has been made. Have you ever seen that in a 5 star hotel. This is not a 5 star level service. However they do not hesitate to bill 400 euros per night during Christmas like a real 5 star hotel.    Regarding services - Very slow and not client oriented. The waiters are really not involved when they serve the clients and they forget all the time something requested. It is quite obvious that they are not managed properly. And no matter if the client is not satisfied. This does not seem to be a priority in this hotel.    In the room if you have to call the reception be prepared not to be called back and stay with your request. It happened many times to us during our stay. Again client satisfaction is not a priority. Client accumulation only is.    Regarding clientele and security - Another contradiction in this hotel if you enter in this hotel with a sandwich or a drink from outside be prepared to be treated like a criminal. But the hotel is full of racaille scum shouting especially at night (4 am) when you try to sleep and they get back from nightclubs. And at this moment there's NO security to stop this. Maybe if they had entered with a sandwich we would have spent a quiet night.    To conclude we will NEVER go back to this hotel.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Rebecca T wrote a review Dec 2018,20,Expect to be disappointed,Firstly this isn’t 5 star accommodation and to be fair we recognised this would be the case when we booked it. We’ve travelled a lot and are realistic in terms of our expectations however this hotel failed to meet these during our stay.    Positives:    The bedroom was clean and the beds were comfortable.  Decent choice at breakfast.  Shower was good.  Location - an easy and safe walk down to all of the main sites. There’s even a stop for the ubiquitous ‘Hop-on-Hop-off’ City Bus Tour directly outside the hotel. Although amusingly the hotel’s Concierge knew nothing about this when we asked him!    Negatives:    Service - appallingly bad at every level. Slow disinterested disingenuous and baffling. The hotel has a glut of middle managers or aspiring middle managers who do nothing! Although at times this was comical to watch especially at breakfast it quickly became irritating and yet another obstacle to overcome when attempting to access basic service requirements.    Security (!) - You are not allowed to bring food or drink into the hotel. On entry your bags will be searched and if you have brought in food or drink you will be made to feel like a criminal. This will happen each and every time you enter the hotel.    This is not made clear at the time of booking nor during registration. Guests are supposed to realise the hotel has this money making racket in place by observing a notice on a rickety sign (it literally fell apart when we were bag checked on the first day!) when arriving at the hotel. Said sign tells guests that due to local laws (?!) guests are not allowed to bring food and drink into the premises which is utter tosh!    Hotel management wants guests to spend their money in the hotel buying their food and drink. If we had known about this bizarre policy in advance we simply wouldn’t have booked to stay here.    We vociferously questioned this policy when our bags were searched and the door staff attempted to confiscate our property. We’d purchased a bottle of wine in the supermarket next door and apparently this wasn’t allowed to be brought into the hotel. After a thoroughly ridiculous interchange with the concierge and Customer Relations Manager (I’m guessing at his title here) they agreed that the wine could be consumed in the hotel and would be brought to our room ‘as a gift’ your guess as to what this means is a good as mine!    Mini-bar: The literature says that there is one but there isn’t you have an empty fridge. Room service is apparently available but there was menu in our room or instructions on how to access it. The pages had been ripped out of the hotel directory in our room!    Bill signing - Apparently only one guest is allowed to sign cheques. Bizarre.    Concierge Service - We asked the concierge to make a couple of restaurant reservations for us. When we turned up to both restaurants no reservations had been made.    No doubt hotel management will respond to this review with the same anodyne response as they have done previously but be assured that none of the complaints from previous guests have been addressed.    Marrakech is a great place to visit but I wouldn’t recommend you stay here to experience it.,Date of stay: December 2018,,"Huddersfield, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rebeccat616

We booked a hotel pick up from the airport which turned out to be very expensive at 300 MAD. Friendly check-in staff bellboys restaurant and housekeeping staff. The restaurant serves good Moroccan and international food at a reasonable price. Good facilities and good breakfast options although can be very busy if you get there late. Lovely pool although much too cold to swim and the heated pool is 1 floor below ground with no natural light hence it would have been really nice if the outdoor jacuzzi was heated.,Date of stay: December 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MichaelChew

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,ElaineG9131 wrote a review Dec 2018,10,Extremely disappointing stay,I’m pretty appalled that this is considered a five star hotel. Having traveled throughout the Middle East and North Africa I had lowered my expectations regarding service but this hotel fell below even my lowered expectations. So many things went wrong:    - Breakfast was so crowded that our options were 1) wait or 2) sit outside in the cold. Difficult to flag servers down for coffee/tea and utensils. Guy at the omelette station gave me someone else’s order.  - Scammed us on a taxi. As we were going to the airport the hotel staff who got us a taxi told us 15 euros is a fair price (it absolutely is not as it’s a 7 minute ride and our taxi when we arrive was only 7 euros). By then it was too late to negotiate with the driver since he already put our bags in the car. I don’t actually care about paying a few euros extra but the fact that the hotel would do this to guests is absolutely unacceptable.  - Slow elevators. We ended up taking the stairs several times and the stairways smelled horrible.  - Didn’t give us enough towels. We had to call guest services multiple times.  - Extra charge to use sauna and other spa facilities.  - We bought bottles of water from the grocery store next door and they would only let us bring in one bottle of water per person.  - No water/towels provided in the gym.  - Thought I was a dude (everything said “Mr.” even though I am clearly female based on my name).    The only person who was helpful was a guy named Hassan who helped with our bags and gave recommendations.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Mohamed A wrote a review Dec 2018,10,What a terrible experience!!!,I stayed 5 nights in this hotel. The hotel is not within the 5 stars category at all. Some of the staff are not helpful and not even willing to help.The worst thing happned there is that i was forced to check out as the rooms was full the next day. I checked in the afternoon and got another room. Anyway i changed my room and forgot my passport inside the old room safe box. The next day (check out day) i remembered that i forgot to take my passport from the old room safe box. So i called them and told them to get my passport as soon as possible to catch my flight in the evening. I waited for almost an hour. They told me that the guest is sleeping and they cant open the room now. I told them first there is no DND in the room and you can open the room anytime. Second it is your responsiblity to check the room and the safe box before you check in another person. Third this situation is very urgent and i must get my passport as soon as possible. Anyway the funny thing is that they finally opened the room after i was bagging them and guess what!!! I unlocked the safe box through inserting my password and found my passport. I also discovered that the guest has checked out early morning and the room was actually empty.,Date of stay: December 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mohamedaV1663OR

The bedroom was overlooking the backyard and 2 pools graced by surrounding palm trees and snowy mountains in the background.  Both the bedroom & living room jad a balcony which I was eager and happy to use either to watch the sunset or relax late night. As for the shower/bathtub/jacuzzi it was perfect.  I did appreciate the service at every step of my stay: from the room service to the cleaning crew to Buddha Bar to the breakfast restaurant I have only met very friendly yet professional staff.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,LCSussman wrote a review Dec 2018,30,Poor service in nice facility,My husband and I stayed for three nights in a suite in November. First the positives. The lobby and pool area are very nice. Our room was large and well designed. Housekeeping also did a very nice job. It was located fairly close to the city center. Unfortunately poor service forces me to rate this between a 2 and a 3. There were many issues. We booked a car from the airport through the hotel at a converted price of (approx) 20 euros. The driver was rude and insistent that we owed him 30 euro and we later found about 7 euro was appropriate. We waited an incredibly long time to check in with no updates on why. We booked a tour with the concierge who told us he would arrange a late check out. Two things happened. He later raised the quoted price by about 30 euro promising an English speaking guide. He did not arrange the late check out and the front desk told us that the concierge service was not connected with the hotel. Later he insisted they were connected. But there was no effort made to assist us or clear up the confusion. There was a small sign that you could not bring food or drink inside the hotel. After we returned with drinks because we did not see the sign they wrote a casual receipt for the items which were then not available when we checked out. Too many issues that one doesn't need on a vacation.,Date of stay: November 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Paris, France",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LCSussman

The staff were very friendly and were always offering to help us and make sure our stay was comfortable. The hotel is located and has easy access to the Menara Mall (which we love shopping at!). Our suite was very clean and I love the theme of the hotel. It really had that Moroccan feel to it (a mix of Berber and Arab to it).

But it was poorly managed. I stayed in a Deluxe Suite which was very spacious. I paid a massive over Euros 700 for a suite where air conditioning was not working. I complained to the Guest Relations Manager who said that it is the policy of the hotel not to run airconditioner in this season. The thermostat in the room was completely dead and we had to open the window to get some fresh air at night. I paid for a non-air-conditioned room which was hot at night - though the weather outside was very pleasant.  Breakfast was good but most of the items served were cold. Except for a freshly made omelette and fried bread other items were all stale and with a flat taste. They do not understand what English Breakfast Tea is? Mint tea was good and tasty. All tour rates offered by the Hotel Concierge were exorbitant - while we found the same tour for half the price in the open market.  Heated swimming pool was very good. Hotel ambiance was excellent. Room service is poor and very slow. Workers do not understand English.  Mr Khalid at the Reception was friendly and cooperative - though he couldn't much because of inadvertent hotel policies.,Date of stay: December 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RayKhan786

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Sammy C wrote a review Dec 2018,50,Thank you!!,Thank you for salvaging our vacation!    If you are looking for 5 star service close enough to all local attractions (including old Medina) yet far enough from the craziness and chaos then this is where you need to book. My wife and I almost cut our vacation short after several bad experiences around the Medina then we stumbled on this place and gave it a shot. 10/10 would book here again in a heartbeat if ever back in Marrakech. We had a one bedroom suite friendly and super helpful receptionist upgraded us to a suite with a garden view and helped us get checked in very swiftly. Everyone around reception was helpful and nice; Adil also helped us the day before and showed us the suite so my wife and I could make an informed decision before booking.    After check in we were welcomed into our superbly clean and spacious room and our bags followed us up within minutes. The suite is beyond comfortable and I doubt anyone could ask for more. I must include an added bonus: the hotel is attached to Menara mall on one side and has its own access directly to the mall. This proved valuable to my wife as she found herself escaping the city chaos without even having to leave the hotel if she didn't feel like it.    ***I read several reviews here about poor customer service so please read this part carefully as I think Morad (guest relations manager) and his team do a FANTASTIC job:    On our first night in the room there seemed to be loud banging and hammering - construction basically - at around 11pm! My wife was absolutely furious and rightly so as we couldn't understand why someone would choose to do construction work at this hour. We called the front desk someone came within 5 minutes and checked it out then said he knows what the source is and will stop it. Sure enough the noise stopped shortly after and all was well until the next morning - although we were never really given a direct explanation as to what the cause was. On our way out to explore the city the next day we bumped into Morad and my wife exclaimed about what happened the night before. Morad took it upon himself to make our lives as easy as possible with as little hassle as possible (especially as we have a very young child with us). He told us to go out and enjoy our day and that he'll have everything sorted by the time we got back. Sure enough we got back and within minutes Morad was there to explain that we will be moved to a different suite away from the source of whatever renovation work was happening nearby (at this point the renovation has stopped I must include). He still did a fantastic job in following up on our serious concerns promptly after already having somewhat of bad experience in Marrakech altogether and wanting to cut out vacation short.    We haven't had a problem since thankfully and we are truly enjoying our stay at this hotel. Breakfast is great very diverse selection. Restaurants are clean and the food is delicious. Every single employee we encounter on the grounds is very nice and friendly. The rooms are always cleaned promptly and nothing goes missing even if we forget to lock things away.

Did not eat dinner at the hotel but breakfast was delicious and well served. Did I mention good coffee? :D  Hotel is connected directly to a good Menara Mall and families with children could enjoy the upper floor entertainment centre if had enough from medina and attractions around.  We had 3-nights stay but would have wanted to stay for 5 days more. Thank you from all heart!,Date of stay: November 2018,,"Tallinn, Estonia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lendaja

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,John Soneye wrote a review Nov 2018,50,Absolute phenomenal hotel!,This hotel is absolutely phenomenal! The service and hospitality are top class. Morad and Fatima were fantastic hosts and they helped with giving my now Fiancé a great experience for her birthday and the wedding proposal.    The hotel is situated right next to Ménara Mall and close to the old city Madina (approx 5-7mins drive). It’s location is perfect for local activities in the city and for beautiful places to wine & dine (i.e Palais Jad Mahal or La Trattoria)    If you are going to Marrakesh for holiday or for any special occasion - I strongly recommend you stay at Savoy Le Grand Hotel.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,sunshine_1721867 wrote a review Nov 2018,50,The best customer service I have ever experienced,I have just returned from this wonderful hotel & I have nothing bad to say about it. The hotel itself is immaculate & the rooms are fantastic. The spa was relaxing & delightful. The hotel is clean & its better in real life the pictures don't do it enough justice. But what really makes this a 5 star hotel is the customer service. The staff are welcoming & helpful & always there to assist. When we went out at night we felt very secure as the concierge would assist us in getting a taxi & negotiate a price for us. I have to mention 2 members of staff who went the extra mile and made this whole experience more than 5 stars MO & KHALID (Managers).  On arrival & throughout the stay Khalid would check if our stay was pleasant & if we needed anything he also arranged juice and a few pastries in the early hours of the morning as we departed at 4am. Thank you so much Khalid really appreciate your efforts.  Lastly I would like to give a big thank you to Mo he is an asset to the company & a true representation of excellent customer service. Mo has assisted us throughout out stay with excursions places to go money exchange. He has been incredible & goes the extra mile for customers. I'm am amazed and his service and wish every hotel I went to had a Mo.  Overall the holiday was fab and I would recommend this hotel to everyone who is visiting. Booking the excursions through the hotel is the best option as the ones in the markets are not reputable companies.  Will definitely go again and stay here services were fab location is fab. There's nothing to moan about and if there is you should talk to the staff who are very helpful in resolving any issues.  Thanks again to Mo & Khalid & the Savoy team.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,biddlebiddle wrote a review Sep 2018,20,Terrible service ruined the stay,"I recently stayed at the Savoy for four nights and unfortunately it was filled with senseless aggravation from the moment I entered. Check-in and check-out each took an hour and each required a 30+ minute wait for a manager who was supposed to come ""in a minute."" (at check-out the manager never showed up)    House keeping was a constant problem. The most inexplicable thing was not receiving any replacement towels even after they were all gone. They literally left me with no towels. They didn't replace the coffee. On the third day after they finished cleaning my room (at 4:30pm!) I called and asked for the missing towels and coffee. The towels arrived a half hour later without the coffee. I asked again for the coffee and a half hour later she returned with one espresso pod and one sugar packet. I asked for the instant coffee sweet-and-low and half-and-half (the items I actually had used) and... she never came back. Oh and I had no comforter on the first day.    I purchased two cigars from the bar the first night but asked to return one after learning that the bar and hotel had no cutter or matches or lighters and after realizing how obscenely expensive they were (the prices were obscene even judged against the standard of overpriced hotel Cuban cigars). The sticker shock was my fault -- this was my first purchase in Morocco and when they quickly flashed the bill I messed up the conversion math. In any case I asked to return one of the cigars no more than five minutes after I purchased it (and I was in their view the entire time so it wasn't as if I had cut it or put it in my mouth) and was told no. First I was told they don't accept returns. Eventually that changed to 'we can't process returns.' Yes they told me that they have no ability to complete a return or fix an error. It literally took well over an hour spread over two days and involving two 20+ minute waits for managers to get the return completed.    (I was eventually able to smoke the remaining cigar and it was in terrible condition; I later discovered La Casa Del Habano which is a 15 minute walk and has perfectly maintained cigars at 1/4 or 1/3 the price of the same ones at the hotel).    For those keeping score at home there were four issues requiring managers (none of which involved the house keeping issues) each time with long waits. I am fairly certain that before now I had not once in my entire life needed a manager to resolve an issue at a hotel.    There were other smaller annoyances. The room had very little light. They turned my a/c off every time they cleaned the room. They have a crazy policy about not bringing in outside food or drinks.    The upside? It is a very attractive hotel especially the pools. The staff despite the problems were always pleasant. The breakfast was pretty good. It was handy to be next to the mall.",Date of stay: September 2018,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Rockville, Maryland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/biddlebiddle

Close to the airport and only a few minutes by horse and carriage to the Medina this hotel offers the full 5 star experience.    We were here in July last year and decided to come in September this year. The two large swimming pools are glorious to swim in and lounge around during the day and the hotel presents a great location for a wide selection of restaurants and tour pick up points.    The only issue is that hotel management make a fuss over guests bringing in bottles of water or food from the neighbouring supermarket and mall on the basis of guest health and safety but really just want to enjoy a monopoly at highly inflated prices.

Check-in is usually a little slow but not terrible and at least they are consistent as it takes my Moroccan colleagues the same amount of time!    Rooms are very good clean and modern nice comfortable bed excellent shower good fast WiFi.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Ella K wrote a review Sep 2018,40,"Okay, but not 5 star",After reading complaints of slow and rude service we were pretty hesitant to arrive at this hotel for our 9 day long holiday.    Despite other claims our check in process was not as long as we anticipated however there is no wiggle room: check in is at 3 no earlier!    We found the pool space to be good with a large pool that only reaches above waist (I’m 5’4). Whilst this is good for relaxing and wading it takes the fun out of jumping in the pool which is banned! The pool isn’t heated however the morning sun warms it up to a bearable temperature perfect for a cool down midday.    We weren’t expecting music to be played around the pool - bring sound cancelling headphones or prepare to listen to terrible Ed Sheeran remixes lift style jazz music or horrendous dubstep.    On a cloudy day we thought we’d check out the spa - prices were more expensive than England with a 30min massage costing £45 or £25 just to use the hot tub and sauna!    Breakfast was okay but nothing fantastic - an array of similar tasting pastries bread warm-ish cooked breakfast items (no beans!!) sushi and a peculiar green ham thing. You can get fresh eggs and crepes/waffles which were lovely. They also serve fresh OJ and Twinings tea which was nice. Coffee also good.    Service seems to be rather slow especially around the restaurant for lunch. The food at lunch isn’t amazing and is rather expensive for what it is. £13 for average pasta or £10 for an average sandwich and chips is a tad steep.    It seems that if you speak Arabic or French you are treated with considerably more respect and attention than if you are English. We found we were ignored a few times which didn’t bother us a lot but made the process of asking for more water at our table a little longer let’s say.    The hotel manager was very nice spoke very good English and made an effort to remember our names and say hello to us around the hotel. He recommended some nice restaurant dinner spots also.    In regards to bringing in food and water in the hotel if you use the side entrance into the mall found by the pool take a large tote and hide your items under a few pieces of clothing it was fine! We snuck in pringles water and champagne without a problem.    Overall this hotel was lovely for what we needed - a pool a place to relax after a long day in the Medina and a comfy bed to lay our heads. It definitely wasn’t 5 star if you’re used to luxury 5 star hotels however the amenities were great (fantastic gym with loads of weight equipment) the rooms were spacious and the location is a 20DH (£1.50) taxi ride away from the Medina. If you get a cheap deal this is a lovely above average hotel.,Date of stay: September 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Ilkley, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ellaknight666

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Pablo wrote a review Sep 2018,50,Amazing hotel,After a few teething problems at the start of the 2 weeks holiday the brilliant General Manager · Karim Boushra Tadros turned things around got everything back on track and ensured we received the 5 star treatment expected of this beautiful hotel that we had enjoyed last year.    This is an outstanding hotel and we are looking froward to returning next year.    Food brilliant. Cocktails a bit pricey but tasty. Breakfast is a great mix of options and the pools are just what you need for the kids.    Extremely secure hotel with constant discrete presence of security.    Alfredo’s restaurant is brilliant Italian food and the service is second to none - beautiful food! Great services thanks to Jawad Kourti the Outlets Manager.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,LJMcCEpsom wrote a review Aug 2018,50,Perfect,I am currently sitting at Menera airport waiting to return to the UK. We have just had a fantastic stay at The Savoy and I couldn’t fault it Sahira who checked us in and actually just checked us out was lovely she was very professional and helpful and even got us to our beautiful room early thank you!  The room was clean and just perfect the breakfast was AMAZING! The choices were fantastic the staff were fantastic everything was Savoy standard.  Pool was spectacularly clean and cleaned day and night yes you had to cotton on early about trying to reserve a sun bed just because it was the apparent done thing this would probably have been the only down side but hey if selfish people want to put a towel on a sun bed at 8am so they can rock up mid afternoon then it’s a case of ‘if you can’t beat em join em’! Not the Savoys fault they can’t police sun beds all day 😂  The Spa was amazing the massage recommended to me by the lovely Mimo was one of the best full body relaxing massages I have ever had and at a very reasonable price thank you for talking me in to it Mimo!  Perfect location ease of getting around vibrant night life lovely restaurants.  Cannot wait to book again for another stay! Thank you to all the wonderful staff who made our much needed break a truly special one!  Only slight negative note: you are not allowed to bring water/snacks in from local shops which is slightly unfair considering the incredible mark up on a 4 dirham bottle of water within the hotel is 10 xs the cost Savoy should probably have less of a profit margin on basic requirements yes they do provide 2 small bottles of courtesy water each day but obviously you need to drink way more in those temperatures for the sake of your health.  But otherwise a perfect holiday and we will be back!,Date of stay: August 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Epsom,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LJMcCEpsom

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Callum R wrote a review Aug 2018,40,Clean but confused,Overall this was a very pleasant stay the hotel was exceptional really classy reception huge clean pool and the rooms were also a big plus large and clean. When we checked in we were upgraded to a pool view room which was an unexpected nice surprise we also ordered room service as we arrived late food was fairly priced and really nice! For what we were looking for nice hotel and hot weather we got what we wanted however there are a number of issues.    After spending 10 days at this hotel there was a few issues that seemed to keep repeating themselves. The hotel seems confused there’s a strange mix of families with young children and large groups of lads. One minute you can look round the pool and there is a young child playing by the side of the pool next minute in that same spot it’s been taken over by 10 lads smoking cigarattes and shisha shouting out to one another with the poor child batted to the side. The hotel needs to make up its mind. Be a family hotel or be a 18-30 hotel it really isn’t acceptable to do both especially when one minute I’m listening to a kids mini disco and the next minute loud aggressive violent rap music.    With regards to breakfast the selection personally wasn’t great for me. They don’t serve bacon sausage beans black pudding or poached eggs. The hot section generally is pretty poor and we ended up having to have an omelette or toast every day with the odd bit of fruit.    Don’t order a cocktail at the hotel. For some bizarre unbeknown reason they charge 240 dirhams for a cocktail equivalent to about 22 quid. We ordered one and it came out in a plastic glass. The reason I say bizarre is because the rest of the prices at the hotel are all reasonably competitively priced.    The sunbed situation when we woke up on our first day at around 9am looked out and every sunbed was occupied with a towel. This is by no means the hotels fault and they don’t have a sign up to say no reserving sunbeds so no ones really doing anything wrong until some mornings when the pool guys wearing blue t shirts decide to whip your towels off the beds fortunately we clocked this when we were sat at breakfast so were able to go over and tell them to put them back. Some other people weren’t so lucky though and regularly turned up to see other people sat on the beds they’d put their towels on. Again make your mind up either you can reserve or you can’t but don’t have people working to different rules.    The staff are hit and miss some seem to be walking around with their heads in the clouds I lost count of the amount of times I asked for something and it never happened. Majority are friendly and do a good job though.    I wouldn’t come back to this hotel for the above negative reasons but it by no means spoiled the holiday.,Date of stay: August 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Worsley, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/371callumr
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Baladeuz wrote a review Aug 2018,40,Not suitable for people looking to chill out and have a zen stay,The hotel is very well located (very central close to restaurants and even has a private entrance to the mall). It also has a private underground parking lot from which the elevator takes you directly to the lobby  The check-in took a lot of time but the lady was very professional. Staff at this hotels are very polite friendly and professional. We don't remember having seen such a thing in other hotels  We asked for a quie room.... We had a quiet one looking at the small swimming pool (there are three swimming pools; a big crowded one with jacuzzi and loud music a quiet nd smaller one and an indoor pool). The room was wide with a nice view but we only had 2 small towels shelves were dusty and the balcony glass was dirty... These are not the standards of a 5-star hotel  We were also disappointed when we turned on TV.... A poor selection of channels; I guess only the free ones! And when we had the idea to go to youtube nd listen to some music we couldn't connect the tv to the web  The breakfast was great! Staff at the restaurant very professional!  We read negative comments concerning the checkout... Ours took less that 3 minutes!  Our car was in the underground lot so we were handed a card to exit the parking (which is shared with the mall and the supermarket) easily and without paying for anything.  The overall experience at Savoy hotel was nice and we would like to come back but not during summer holidays,Date of stay: August 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Rabat, Morocco",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Baladeuz

You will be disappointed if you expect any kind of service from the staff working at the breakfast or pool side.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Ikram1980 wrote a review Aug 2018,30,5* Hotel with 2* Service,Hotel is Really nice and in the middle of all the hustle and bustle of Marrakech. It’s really lively outside with all the amenities required.    Hotel is really nice pretty much what you would expect from a 5* hotel. We booked the what’s supposed to be the best room in the hotel the prestigious suite and were told at reception that that’s the best room in the hotel.    Room was really nice still standard for a 5* hotel nothing to make it that brilliant apart from a jacuzzi. However the good stuff ends there for the hotel.    The breakfast was at best average and understaffed everyday having to wait ages for juices or tea. The reception once again understaffed with only one at reception even when there where huge Ques no one at concierge having to ask on several occasions for service even though we were trying to book excursions through them.    The room service was non existent as well every time we called no one ever came. The staff are really polite but once again either understaffed or not bothered. The hotel lobby and showers smelt horrible like a gutter smell but that maybe due to the heat... the supposed best room in the hotel was serviced like a normal room. We had 5 staying in the room with one tea bag a day and one mug. 4towels and x3 beds and x4 waters. No consistency what so ever. When we rang to tell them they kept saying they will sort it and never did. Rather book Sofitel or four seasons next time.    Still here writing this at the moment so hopefully management see this and improve and I will write again later on.,Date of stay: August 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Leicester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ikram1980
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Rebecca C wrote a review Aug 2018,30,Rooms a good... that’s about it,The hotel has huge clean rooms however that’s the only good thing about this hotel. It’s seriously over priced and it’s certainly not a five star hotel like it sells its self as being.    1. Checking in takes forever it was 1am and no one else was there but this still took nearly half an hour.  2. Breakfast had a wide selection however it was lukewarm if that every day of our stay.  3. The hotel is not sound proof. Children are running up and down corridors screaming in the middle of the night.  4. Around the pool there are very few waiters and when you do ask for a drink it takes half an hour to arrive  5. I wanted to print off my boarding pass so I went to the business centre.. the printer didn’t have any paper and no one was around to get some more.  6. There are big queues at reception most of the day and very few members of staff on the desk. Be prepared for a half an hour wait.  7. The cost of a can of coke is shocking... £4!! Go to the Carrefour next door and sneak them in in your pockets like we did!

The hotel is very clean accessible into the Menara Mall area with a direct entrance from the hotel modern gym with helpful instructors.

Adil; again at the front desk who has a warm glow feeling about him again very genuine and excellent communication.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Lcdthethird wrote a review Jul 2018,50,Great Honeymoon Hotel,First of all I'd love to start off this review by saying thank you to Abdellah at Savoy Le Grand Hotel. He helped us immensely plan our days and nights out in Marrakech and he was a pleasure to speak with.    We decided to come to Marrekech last minute while celebrating our honeymoon in Portugal and we are extremely happy we chose Savoy Le Grand. Both my wife and I have stayed in great hotels in the USA Thailand Myanmar Bali and Savoy is up there with some of the best luxury hotels we've been too.    The hotel location is pretty darn good. It's close to the Old City at about a 15 min walk or $5 taxi ride. The hotel is adjacent to a large mall so you can grab a bite there if you want. It is also between 10-15 minutes from the airport depending on the time of day you go.    Service at the hotel is top notch. The employees go out of their way to make you feel comfortable and you don't feel a lot of pressure to tip. Although we glady tipped the staff they never asked like some places do.    We had a great and I mean great room on the third floor overlooking the pool and our room was massive. The bed was heaven. We both slept like the dead. Room service was also quick. We ordered and food arrived generally within 20-30 minutes. The shower is top notch and will blast you with hot water. Everyday it is cleaned by the cleaning staff.    The free breakfast we had was superb. Everyday we woke up to delicious fresh pressed orange juice and Moroccan tea. You can eat pancakes or crepes or waffles. They have cereal and yogurt and tons of sweets. It is really really good.    The restaurants at the hotel are great too. One of the restaurants was showing the World Cup games so everyday we watched a match and drank a beer or wine there and it was great. I love how the other guests would come watch and get into it.    The pool is large and the seats they have are very comfortable. We sat in a few different types of chairs and seats but my favorites were the sofas and the canopy chairs. I felt like a celeb when the staff came by to offer a free watermelon slice or see if we needed drinks.    Another pleasant surprise was when we needed to change money the hotel gave a good rate. A lot of hotels gouge you when converting but Savoy Le Grand is very close to the online price and that in itself is a very great sign of customer service and putting the guests first.    Check-in and Check-out were super easy as well. There were no real surprises besides the deposit you pay when you stay. This money is credited back to you when you leave so it really doesn't matter.    I do have a few suggestions for the hotel though. Alcohol prices were a tad bit inflated. I still drank but I would have been more open to staying and drinking at the hotel if prices were more in line with local prices. Also the wifi was weak in our room randomly. I am not sure about wifi in Morocco but sometimes it was weak.    All in all I 100 percent loved our honeymoon stay here at Savoy Le Grand and I would suggest you book a stay here too. Savoy has made me a fan and I will definitely look to stay at their properties again.,Date of stay: June 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Cary, North Carolina",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lcdthethird

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,bholly504 wrote a review Jun 2018,10,Bad Customer Service & DO NOT go during Ramadan,1) The hotel has a limit of how much bottled water you can bring in. I think it was maximum 2 bottles each- they search your bags everytime you go into the hotel.  2) Do not eat at the hotel. The food was awful and really expensive. Service was horrible- we were told by our waiter that its his turn to eat and he will serve us when he is done.  3) Ramadan comes first customer service comes last. Workers at the hotel encourage their guests to follow ramadan and dont understand that you may not want to.  4) Hotel was completely empty when we were there  5) Ordering a drink was frowned upon  6) I used my credit card to hold the reservation. When we checked out my friend wanted to pay for our stay so they cancelled my card (I signed a paper from the machine etc.) and they charged my friends card (she did her pin got a receipt etc.). Upon returning home from the trip I see the hotel charged my card as well and did not cancel it. I have been emailing with them and am still waiting for a response. So far I am out $450 dollars and have not been offered a refund or explanation.  7) I will not be returning here- and I do not recommend this hotel.Morocco in general has no respect for women and people do not speak english. It was shocking that 1/50 people in this hotel spoke english...at a multinational hotel...they told us that english is not their native language and thats the reason...yes but you work in customer service...every city in the world should have some people who speak english at their hotel.,Date of stay: May 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Vancouver, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bholly504

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,james h wrote a review Jun 2018,50,Amazing stay at the Savoy,The Savoy Grand Hotel was what you would expect from a 5 star hotel from the moment we arrived and for the duration of our stay the service was impeccable. The deluxe suite was superb and the size of an average apartment. The suite was serviced twice daily and immaculately clean. The breakfast was superb with nothing to much trouble with again impeccable service throughout. The pool was beautiful and as our stay fell during Ramadan the hotel only had 30% occupancy. The concierge was very helpful accommodating and gave expert advice for restaurants shows and sights to see. The whole trip was brilliant and can not recommend this hotel strongly enough. Like many advertised 5 stars hotels you sometimes think whom gave them the rating. Being frequent dinners and short break stayers at the Savoy in London this did not disappoint and truly worthy of the rating. The adjoining shopping Mall has very interesting shops and the Buddha Bar and the La Villa des Orangers is worth venturing too for a wonderful meal.,Date of stay: June 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Norwich, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/700jamesh
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Kiera wrote a review Jun 2018,50,"comfortable stay, beautiful hotel, service could be better",For the price this hotel is excellent. The bed was SO COMFORTABLE. The room was clean the bathroom had a nice large tub and it was the first time in Morocco where I actually felt I had enough hot water and water pressure. The grounds of the hotel are absolutely lovely. The pool is beautiful but unfortunately is not heated.    I took off one star because the service could definitely be better. When checking in they asked for a photocopy of our passports and then told us there would be a 15-20 minute wait. No problem. But after 15 minutes she came back and asked us to copy our passports again stating that she had misplaced the original copies. When we voiced our concern that there were copies of our passports floating around the hotel somewhere she didn't seem to understand our concern.    We also had a bit of an issue with our room service and the person delivering our food didn't seem particularly concerned with remedying it but clearly still expected a tip. However the food was incredible and delicious so I almost didn't care that the service wasn't.    Funnily enough our bellhop was incredibly kind and attentive and he was the only staff member we encountered who spoke perfect English. It's not a huge deal that the other staff didn't speak great English as they spoke French but I feel like that bellhop is being totally under-utilized.    Overall we had an amazing stay. You won't find a hotel with this many amenities for a better price.,Date of stay: October 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Canada,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KieraBen

Walking distance to the main square. Lovely clean room. Amazing pool area that’s well staffed. Super breakfast. Super service. Amazing Spa area excellent staff. Only downside is security staff at entrance are poor quality & very rude. The policy of not allowing smacks or drinks from local supermarket into the hotel is beyond ridiculous what harm is bringing back a few cans of Coke & Water in the evening apart from having to purchase a can of Coke & a small bottle of water for 100DM (€10)?!!!    This hotel maintains my 5 Stars due to my Employee of the Month (June 2018) MOHAMED BOUJANN this gentleman is very attentive great manners and a lovely person.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Sophie wrote a review Jun 2018,30,"Nice hotel, terrible service.",I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights with a friend of mine.    The day we arrived we were at the hotel early (11am) and were happy to hear that our room was ready. The first thing we did was go to get a bite to eat (after the reception told us the restaurant was open). Upon arriving at the restaurant and asking for a menu a very rude waiter who worked at the pool area told us they were not serving food till Midday anywhere. After looking for menus myself i saw that the pool actually served from 11am and the restaurant too. After showing this he grudingly agreed to let us order but gave us looks the entire rest of our stay.    Some plus points: The room was big clean and very nice! Definitely a plus.The breakfast was also great and the breakfast service was good. Food in general was good we had requested airport transfer which was good too.    Negative points: When asking the concierge for camel riding options he said the only option was a 2 day 1 night excursion and then laughed at me when I pointed at other options in the package he had just handed over. When asking him to organize a private driver for us he gave us one price (over priced) and the next day another which after some time he agreed to the original price but we were introduced to a normal taxi and not chauffeur service. In general the staff didnt always seem to be able to answer questions and it was constantly necessary to google for information. When asking the lady at the currency exchange for smaller bills she did not even look at us and just grunted. I wanted to order some water by the pool and had to walk around to find someone who would then never return to then be told the next day that it isnt possible. I was very confused and after saying I know it’s possible they finally agreed.    We told the guest relations person some of these points at the end of the first day but we didnt think that she did take it seriously.    This hotel has so much potential however the service was terrible. Service wise this hotel is not even a 3star. I dont know if its their lack or knowledge or they just dont want to help.    Tip: if you want your room made up you better put a sign up otherwise it will not be done.,Date of stay: June 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Madrid, Spain",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sophiemB5329DM
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,ife f wrote a review Jun 2018,40,"Good hotel, Poor Staff",This hotel is clean and spacious. The music by the pool was a little loud but i think they did this to cover up the sound of the building works. This just made things worse. Would have been good if they did the building work in less peak times of the day.  Our room was nice - we got upgraded to a suite it was big spacious and not noisy. the bathtub was great came with Jacuzzi features.    Big pool is not heated - annoying but can be managed.  The gym closes at 7pm which i think is too early.  Breakfast was good plenty of selection.  25/30 minute walk to the center of Marrakesh.    The main downside of this hotel is the staff. Some of them jsut seem like they dont want to do anything. When we arrived we got a very warm welcome.  The concierge was terrible they didnt know anything at all. i knew more that they did. Asked them for restaurant ideas - they only had 1 (Al Fassia). what is a concierge for if not to know the area. My guide book was much better at suggestion.  On another day i asked concierge for directions to the Saadian tombs they gave me wrong directions to the point where another member of staff who overheard ran after me to give me better directions!  I asked concierge to book me into a spa i had researched he said he would do so and give me a call in my room! Nothing at all!    Cleaners were fine always said good morning. Mohammed at breakfast was great they should all take note from him. The food staff making pancakes seemed irritated when i asked for fresh pancakes rather than the cold/tepid ones that were left outside.    Lastly i asked for a taxi at reception- i was told to go to the concierge. There is nobody at concierge she informs me to wait there till someone arrives. As i'm on holiday and not here to argue i do as i'm told. i wait for 5 minutes still nobody the girl at reception is all the while just standing there. Eventually another member of staff asks what im waiting for and informs me that concierge is on a break. So i wait a little more whilst they get concierge who then helps to get me a taxi.  All the while the receptionist is standing there and has not picked a phone call or anything - i guess its out of her job role.    Right next to the mall. the issues with bringing things from the mall is minor - really didn't affect uswe really didn't buy anything. I guess if you must  just put it in your handbag.    Would be nice if they made sure the bird poo was cleaned off the breakfast chairs.    Apart from staff the hotel was fine for me.,Date of stay: May 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/280ifef
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Dermott Gillespie wrote a review May 2018,50,Super Staff and Super Hotel,Just back from a stay in the Savoy in Marrakech and it was most enjoyable .The hotel is a great location . About ten minutes walk from the hustle and bustle of the Suk's and close to the airport. It has the added advantage of the hop on hop of tourist bus stopping right at the front door if you need the transport . The staff were excellent from check in to check out .The pool area was great with plenty of shelter for those of us who prefer the shade and a good selection of chill out music playing all day . The breakfast was amazing . It was Ramadam while i was there but there was no issue with getting alcohol in the hotel whilst it seemed to be off the menu in a lot of the local restaurants . The hotel is located right next to a pretty western style shopping mall and a selection of restaurants that would cater for most needs .

Lots of restaurants and the Mall is right next to it. Close to the airport as well.  Upon Checking i informed the hotel manager Moab about my intention to propose to my fiance during my stay and wanted him to help with setup and decorations in the hotel. He was kind enough to offer an upgrade to a beautiful suite at a very nominal charge. Every day he was kind of enough to check in and make recommendations for various activities. The night of my proposal the hotel and staff went above and beyond to decorate the room with rose petals on the bend and floor. even offered a complimentary cake. The staff was very friendly the hotel was super clean. The pool was great and huge. I would definitely stay again.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Sophie M wrote a review May 2018,50,Fabulous & special stay!,So after reading some of the TA reviews I was a bit nervous but honestly I’m starting to wonder if they even stayed here! From start to finish this hotel was amazing. We arrived at the hotel 6 hours prior to checking in time so expected to leave bags and go for a wonder but instead we were upgraded to a suite and checked in early. Check in was quick unlike some reviews have said. Suite was well kept and huge even had a jacuzzi bath. Comfortable and massive bed few English channels. The breakfast included every morning was lovely especially freshly cooked omelettes. We didn’t eat at any of the restaurants as looked quite pricy but loads of restaurants in the near vicinity just outside the hotel. The sun loungers were so comfortable and the pool was always lovely and clean. A little cold but so refreshing in the scorching sun we spent a lot of time in the pool. Nice shisha in the lounge bar and Karim who was the manager in the lounge bar was an awesome and friendly guy and made us some nice cocktails and made an effort to get to know us. Yes there is a policy of not bringing food or drink from outside but let’s just say if there’s a will there’s a way...(I.e suitcases not checked...)    The location is also absolutely perfect! 15 minute walk to Medina 15 minute walk to Menara Gardens 5 min drive to Gueliz (defo go to Gueliz!) and you’ve got the mall tagged onto it.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Tinks21 wrote a review May 2018,30,Good stay but a few issues including hotel works...,We chose to stay at the Savoy as they generally have a good reputation across the globe. We decided to treat ourselves so we upgraded to a two bedroom suite. We arrived in the evening so the hotel was fairly quiet. We were greeted by warm smiles and told we were going to be upgraded to a suite. I explained we had already booked and paid for a suite - so that was a tad awkward. Anyway check-in was fairly smooth and we were given a lovely suite overlooking the pool area. However considering how much we paid for this suite there were a few issues I wouldn’t have expected in a five star hotel. Firstly there were no bath robes or slippers in the room. Not a massive deal but something you’d generally expect in a hotel of this class. We rang for these items and housekeeping brought two pairs of slippers but no bath robes. We explained we needed another pair but never saw them again that evening. There also seems to be an issue in replacing coffee pods and tea bags. We had to ask several times for these to be replenished. There were also a lack of toiletries and again had to ask for these to be replaced. One day we had no towels and had to ring twice before they turned up. Now it isn’t the end of the world. - the room was lovely it was very clean and it was great to have a living space area with sofas. However these little issues can make a big difference to the experience. We were only there for four nights but we had to ring house keeping and reception about twice a day. The other BIG issue is the work that’s taking place on the site. The drilling is so loud and in order to cover the noise of the drilling the hotel cranked up the music so it was impossible to relax with the racquet. I didn’t realise work was going to take place as I probably would have avoided the hotel. Our room overlooked the works so any hope of sitting on the balcony and getting some peace was impossible we practically had to shout over each other to be heard.    Breakfast was great no issues there at all and there was plenty of choice. We tried the Italian on site which was average but could have been very good if they just added salt to the dishes. Waitress brought bread and oil but no side plates. Finally found her and asked her to bring some plates but for the prices we were paying we shouldn’t really have needed to do that.    There is a mall attached to the hotel which is convenient. We tried a couple of food places there again fairly average but edible. I’d advise you to go to the main square and check out the food places there. The three I’d recommend and have good veggie options are Niranj (fantastic food) Nomad and Café Arabe.    On a side note: You’re not allowed to bring food from outside into the hotel and your bag gets checked at the entrance. It didn’t bother us but I know it can be an issue for some people.    We tried the spa and it was FANTASTIC. We’d highly recommend the coconut hammam well worth the price in our opinion.    Plenty of taxis available outside but they do tend to rip you off. The hotel is about 30 min walk from the main square or a 10 min taxi ride so it shouldn’t cost more than 20 dirhams but we did end up paying up to 50 though some tried to charge 100!! We did find a taxi driver who took us to town for 20 but he took it upon himself to take us to various shops. We didn’t mind too much as we wanted to have a look round but considering we only wanted a lift into town it was a bit presumptuous - I’m assuming he was getting commission. One of the shops he took us to was an Argan oil store which was fascinating but I wouldn’t bother buying Argan oil from there. Go to the shop in the Mall where you can buy pure argan oil for 150 dirhams for 300ml (it’s in the souk part). We paid 160 for 150ml so were conned a bit. Lesson learnt.    Overall is was a good stay. If they sorted out their housekeeping and pre-warned guests that works were taking place it would have been great.    We did raise these issues directly with the hotel and the duty manager was great. He noted them down and said he will feedback. He also gave us late check out for no additional cost.    Overall it was fine. We were out and about for most of the days but the incessant drilling hotel works and the lack of housekeeping did ruin the experience a bit.,Date of stay: May 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Manchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tinks21

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,SusieCR wrote a review May 2018,40,"Stay for modern conveniences, not for the Moroccan charm",This hotel delivers on almost every level. The rooms are spacious and well appointed. Everything was clean and there is an impressive pool area. It is like going to a beach resort but located in the city. It is well located and you can walk into the Mall from the hotel which is very convenient. However it is a soulless hotel and does not represent Morocco or its culture. You might as well be in Dubai. The lobby and bar areas are cold and unwelcoming but provide for what you need. The two issues I had at the hotel were noisy guests in the next room and when we informed the hotel they said there was nothing they could do (so we dealt with it ourselves which does not seem like a good idea normally). The second issue I had was at the gym where there were no towels or water available.

We arrived late in the evening the car organised by the hotel was waiting for us in the arrivals lounge which was perfect.  The concierge and front desk team were very friendly and spoke very good English. They upgraded us to a Suite the room was huge large sitting room with TV and balcony and then a huge bedroom space with another balcony and TV. We had a walk in wardrobe off the bedroom as well as a large on suite bathroom with double sink large walk in massage shower and Bath with massage jets.  The hotel was not too busy when we went so there was always plenty of sunbeds they offer towels and drinks/food throughout the day. We loved the pool (though a little cold) it had beds to lie in beach style shallow ends and a large waterfall.  Breakfast was excellent be aware it is a French style breakfast so loads of pastries and meat/cheeses to choose. There is a cooked option which had an omelette & crepe stations eggs sausages mushrooms tomatoes etc...  The Bhudda Bar which is next door is AMAZING! We had dinner at 9pm (opens at 8:30pm) the sushi was the best we have ever had and the entertainment was incredible! You should not miss this if you have the chance!  Overall we had an amazing stay!

The park is across street with the rental bikes a block away to start a proper walk/bike tour. Horses and camels and are also across the street and everything is a fair walk or short drive away. The hotel is quite expansive. It is too large and scattered. I do not understand their concept of filling the further rooms first coming then closer to the reception/entrance and breakfast area. The further rooms are quite far but really quite as they have access to the secondary pool not the main one. Rooms are a bit outdated and old fashioned so are the toilets; sort of early 2000s resorts. Food is diverse and great and staff are really hospitable.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Mai Chashe wrote a review May 2018,50,Extraordinary Stay,Beautiful hotel decor & design. We arrived before 12.30 midday & did partly check in. The lady stated we return after an hour & half. We visited the Menara Mall & had lunch. We returned completed check in. We booked a garden view & had requested pool view through email. The concierge escorted us to our room The room was modern contemporary design with coffee facilities ironing board & iron fridge safe bath rob & slippers modern television with a wide selection of channels in various languages reliable free WiFi  balcony air con & heater. It was my daughter’s birthday so l requested surprise birthday decorations. When we arrived our room was spacious & very clean with pool view with no extra charges. They brought a birthday cake & beautiful flowers later that day. Despite asking the housekeeper not to change our bedding or clean our room. Our room was cleaned daily & different decorations. Breakfast was magnificent & they offer a variety buffet breakfast that is excellent & beautifully presented. A chef preparing  omelette pancakes on request We had meals at both restaurant they are very pricey. Most of our meals were at Menara Mall very reasonable prices. The hotel grounds were cleaned daily around the clock. There is a spa gym several pools including heated indoor pool open until 9:00pm very beautiful well maintained grounds. The waterfall by the pool was breathtaking & spectacular especially at night showing luminous colours. The staff were very friendly despite speaking limited English & excellent service all around will give housekeepers 10/10. We are already planning another trip towards end of the year. It is arguably the best hotel l have stayed in.,Date of stay: February 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dolaya75

Hotel staff were friendly and helpful & rooms were spacious and comfortable. Be careful to close windows as we did get bitten. Also cheaper to eat outside at restaurants by the Menara Mall (we wondered why the Italian restaurant within the hotel was deserted!).

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Andy C wrote a review May 2018,30,Very average,Check in was painfully slow. Check out wasn’t much better.  Housekeeping was shocking. Staff just open the door without knocking and just mumble housekeeping as they open the door. I was naked in the middle of the room one time. Tea and coffee was for one person yet there was two of us and slow to calls.  Housekeeping give you two small bottles of water a day and the security won’t let you bring your own water in. A joke.  Bathrooms are tired with poor quality finishes (grout mouldly fixtures loose) and shower water pressure is poor.  Pool is lovely and beverage staff very helpful especially the chap on the roller skates.  Head concierge was great and very helpful.  Lounge bar and staff was very good.

I would like to specially mention a beautiful lady kaoutar (Ambassador F&B hostess metropol breakfast) she by far was the best person I had come across from the morning breakfast time she was so welcoming with such a beautiful smile.I couldn't resist but fall in love with the place even more.I definitely recommend this place to stay to any body visiting Marrakech.,Date of stay: April 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/222razas
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,AJ3273 wrote a review May 2018,40,Pleasantly surprised,After reading the reviews I was slightly nervous how this hotel would be. We started by using the airport taxi service which was great. Check was late in the evening and took about 20mins but not a problem. Shown to our room which was specious clean and modern. Unfortunately (not the hotels fault) we had some very inconsiderate room neighbours of 3 young girls that kept us awake most of the night. The next morning we asked to change rooms which was handled swiftly and with no fuss. We didn't spend alot of time during the day in the hotel but returned in the evening to enjoy the indoor pool and lovely bar. On the whole a few minor quibbles. Slow service in the bar round the pool and the internet unless you're in reception kept dropping in and out but on the whole it far exceeded our expectations. Only 15 mins walk to the medina 10 mins from the airport. Staff were friendly and helpful ensuring we knew how much to pay for taxis etc  Felt safe and secure and we would return. Any reviews giving 1 or 2 stars I would ignore. Enjoy!,Date of stay: May 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Liverpool, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AJ3272
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,pearl469 wrote a review Apr 2018,50,Best overall stay!,We had one of the suites with a pool view and a large balcony with sunbeds. Very comfortable stay comfortable beds and lounge area. Loved relaxing in our room and balcony whatever the time day or night.    Breakfast was great good selection to choose from. Fresh eggs crepes waffles and dutch pancakes made on request. Deliciously tasty!    Would like to say it was the cleanest hotel I have stayed it was not; however it was still very clean 8/10. Usually I am very picky about the cleanliness but as everything else was spot on despite not being clean to the highest standards it was still a very very comfortable stay.  Other amenities of the hotel which we were pleasantly surprised by on arrival were the mall (Menara mall with Carrefour supermarket) being adjacent/connected to the hotel with quick easy access and also currency exchange service near the front desk. Concierge were friendly and provided good directions notably Rachid.    The pool area was great lively with good music as was the indoor heated pool. The restaurants were also on point selling delicious pastas and burgers with fantastic service from Jawad.    Though there are many riad/traditional type of places which look very pretty they would not have suited our needs. This was more of a modern establishment in line with other great hotels.    Marrakech is a place to visit itself however our stay may not have been as pleasant if not for this lovely hotel!

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Dessy D wrote a review Apr 2018,30,"Great location and design, smell in rooms, breakfast not suitable for vegans",Hotel's location is great - in the 'posh' new area 15 min walk from Medina direct entrance to shopping mall. The rooms are large and spacious - my partner and I stayed in a suite - large bedroom and separate living room a dressing room large terrace and two bathrooms - which made getting our morning showers before our early tour departures very easy. It was perfectly designed but had a strong smell of old and unused space which wouldn't go after keeping the windows open.    The hotel was mostly lacking in its service - the breakfast buffet had no vegan options except for fruit and bread and the housekeeping staff seems to be retaining the caffeine coffee pods from the rooms as they would restock the decaf ones and reluctantly give regular coffee only after you've made several calls each day.  Heads up for those traveling in the winter months - the reception and restaurants are not heated (hence uncomfortably cold) and doors are kept open - we went to breakfast wearing our coats and still felt cold.    Regarding the no food and drink from outside policy - it indeed exists however they would let you bring in a large water bottle per person each day and keep the rest at the concierge where you can get it from at will. We had no problems bringing snacks - fruit and crackers from the supermarket.,Date of stay: March 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/98dessyd

What stood out for me was our head concierge Medhi who was amazing in everything he did for us nothing was to much for him and he was always so so polite and with a smile on his face his staff of porters were always very friendly and all spoke english.  Abdou the assistant front officer manger was amazing we had a few problems with our room and he was very understanding and he and the guest relations was so so helpful  they wanted to upgrade us with all the problems we had but i said no as we only has 3 days to go .. but nothing was to much for them .. the only thing i must say is housekeeping in some areas need to be 5 star service not 4 star and not all the staff in the hotel say hello. if you are guest then every staff should say hello or good morning or good evening it did not happen all the time and it must change and make it feel a bit more welcoming... also the security are so so friendly especially at the front of the hotel.  over all i had a amazing time and i will be staying there again this year i hope  cant wait for the new pool on the roof to open thats going to be amazing  Medhi see you soon    So thankyou Savoy le Grand hotel Marrakech see you soon,Date of stay: March 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fabianbarallon

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,NAZ wrote a review Apr 2018,30,Lovely hotel and staff however.....,Hotel is gorgeous and clean. The staff speak English too so no problem if you like me are zero french speaking! Check in and check out was quick and very pleasant. We had the family room overlooking the pool - it was fabulous. Cleaning top marks and no issues. I would keep coming back however one major let down is the fact you cannot bring and drinks or snacks from outside even water! There is a mini supermarket next door in the mall which is great place however useless for us as we couldn’t bring any nightly snacks in for the kids and water for us. I understand the hotel want to ensure only their food is bought however no matter how posh a hotel is these I feel are basic rights to be able to have a choice where to buy especially when the price difference is say 3DH for a large water bottle at the supermarket and hotel charges you 30DH. Big difference!!  If the above doesn’t concern you then this is the hotel to have a fabulous stay. Yes the pool outside is cold but surely that’s due to the weather and not the hotels fault as they do have a heated indoor pool too! Breakfast top marks !!    HOTEL- feedback for you would be to make your no food or drink policy known at time of booking to agents as it’s very unfair to pay for the hotel only to find out on the day of arrival your stipulations. As guests we should be allowed to make an informed choice. You would also not get bad reviews for this part as guests would know about this beforehand.,Date of stay: April 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Manchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1_uuuuuuuuuuuuuuu

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,thistravelingdesignr wrote a review Apr 2018,10,APPALLING! Rubbish from previous guests under our bed and NEVER cleaned.....,The first thing I noticed when we walked into our hotel room was that it looked dirty. I could see hair and dirt on the floor and also dust on all the surfaces. I looked under the bed and found rubbish (trash) from previous guests still under the bed. When I spoke with reception and housekeeping they assured me it would be cleaned the next day. It was not... I went back to complain again and they sent a housekeeping manager to our room. They said they would cleaning staff up immediately. We vacated the room for over an hour and when we returned the room was still dirty. I removed the rugs myself and wiped all the surfaces with our childs baby wipes. The floors were still filthy. At 9pm that evening housekeeping knocked to come clean the room.... a bit late in the day! I complained at reception again the next day but not once during our stay was the floor cleaned or the rubbish removed. So I just left it....    The pool set up is great but the water is so cold that no one swims. Such a waste. We ordered drinks from the pool bar and our cocktail glass was literally less than half full when we received it....such poor service and quality especially for the prices they charge.    The buffet breakfast is fine offering a wide selection for everyone. The service staff were friendly and helpful.    This hotel is trying to pretend it is a lot nicer than it really is. Everything about it is below bar and overpriced.,Date of stay: March 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Paris, France",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thistravelingdesignr
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Aussie-Nawab wrote a review Apr 2018,40,"Magnificent Property, Great Breakfast",I visited this place as a last minute booking as my first hotel was terrible we didn't want to settle for anything less than excellent. We booked Savoy for 3 nights and while it was pricey the stay was extremely luxurious and comfortable. Great view of the pool absolutely amazong breakfast and good facilities. The staff at the front desk including the manager were very friendly and accomodating. The only suggestion i would make to the hotel is not have that DJ near the pool play blaring loud music all afternoon when someone wants to have a quiet nap. Also many a times their exchange lady was at the counter but the sign read out for lunch. Which probably meant out of currency. Also the concierge/security guys were very creepy. Looks like they had a commision thing going on with the taxi drivers. But the check in staff were superb.    Apart from those couple of issues our stay was pleasant because of the location and quality of food and property.

We were aware check in is from 14.30 and that we might have to leave our luggage as we arrived to the hotel at 11.00am. However we were greeted by Mourad on arrival as we were walking up to the desk. Mourad very kindly informed us the room was available and very swiftly checked us in.  The room was very pleasant we had a ground floor room which was very large and a very spacious bathroom.  We spent our first day by the pool and ordered food and drink from the bar. Whilst the service at the pool is very slow the staff were very pleasant.  Concierge were very helpful to my partner and booked a trip to a golf course.  Breakfast was very nice - so much choice! Fresh fruit cereal eggs - freshly made salad a varity of pastries and even freshly made crepes!  We continued to see Mourad thorough out our stay and he was very welcome and made sure we were okay and always offered his advice as to where we were going.  On our last day my partner got to watch his team play on the big screen in the Shisha lounge and they won so our stay ended on a very high note!

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Anouska88 wrote a review Mar 2018,40,"Lovely hotel, beautiful pool area & cool lounger options but can't bring in any food or drink",We had been to Marrakech before and stayed in a couple of different Riads in the Medina and decided this visit to stay slightly outside in a more modern hotel. For a long weekend break with a pool this was a fantastic option. The hotel is very nice inside with multiple swimming pools including a heated pool (we didn't get around to checking this out though) and the main pool has lots o different lounger and sunbed options it was really enjoyable during the afternoon.  The hotel is also in my opinion a great balance of old and new as it is a simple walk along one main road to th Main Medina gate entrance from which you can explore of the wonderful culture eateries and markets of Marrakech and then retrat back to a nice hotel easily afterwards.  BE WARNED though there is a Carre Four supermarket next door and we went in to get a few drinks and snacks to take to our room and had no idea until security at the hotel entrance stopped us but you aren't allowed to bring ANY external food or drink in even a water bottle which we found quite unfair and really annoying as we were made to dispose of our food etc we had just bought. I don' know if there is genuine health & safety reasoning behind this or the hotel just want to restrict you to only buying food & drink there bu that was the only downside for us otherwise it was a fabulous long weekend escape.,Date of stay: March 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anouska88

All of the comments below were fed back during our stay and before we left - after complaining we were looked after but this level of service should have been standard from day one in a supposedly 5 star hotel    Negatives:    1. noisy construction was going on around both pools the entire time we where there we hadn’t been made aware of this at time of booking or in the days up to arriving    2. Check in took nearly 45mins there seemed to be issues with the rooms we’d booked (a twin room and a double room) and when we got your room it wasn’t a twin so had to move to another room. We had tried to call the hotel to confirm our rooms in the days before at which point we were told to call back..... we also emailed twice no response    3. Air conditioning didn’t work in our room and we had to call someone to fix it    4. One of our rooms was left unserviced one day when we followed up to complain they said they’d sent someone this was at 11:30 at night!    5. No drinking water provided in rooms !!  I found astonishing for a hotel that says it’s 5* !!! . The hotel security will try and stop you if you try and bring water in we still did bring in our own water and argued the point that water is a human be necessity and they don’t provide any free drinking water plus one of the bottles of water we paid for at the hotel had clearly been refilled and had soapy suds on the surface and also tastes of detergent    No service provided around the second pool areas even after waking to the bar to order drinks they never came back to see if we needed anything else throughout the day    6. Food in hotel average  (except breakfast which was always lovely ). There are some great eateries just next to hotel which were much better in terms of food and service    7. Never offered any type of compensation - not even a free bottle of wine for the problems we’d been experiencing - they need to realise “Good will” can go a long way!!    POSITIVES:  Comfy beds and nice rooms  Lovely pool areas with lots of sunbeds.  Great breakfasts !  A number of great staff particularly Mohamed (Bella Lounge) Jawad (Italian restaurant) and Noureddine (Metropole Restaurant Manager).  Nice hotel could be great but needs a lot of work on service to be a 5 star  Good location.  Buddha Bar next door was brilliant  great service and amazing cocktails!,Date of stay: March 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alisonb439

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Andy J wrote a review Mar 2018,50,Excellent hotel,The hotel experience was excellent from the welcome at reception to the quality of the food and the leisure facilities. The gym in particular is very good with all of the equipment one could require for a solid workout. The hotel is next to Buddha bar which offers super evening entertainment as well as a shopping mall attached. The outdoor pool is huge and we were lucky to get some sunshine so sat out and enjoyed the pool area.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,68margaret47 wrote a review Mar 2018,50,Enjoyable stay,Visited early February. This was our first trip to Marrakesh and after reading reviews on the hotel decided to stay here. We stayed at the Savoy le Grande for 7 nights and we were not disappointed. No problem booking in staff were very friendly our room was very spacious clean and we had tea & a ☕️ coffee machine which was topped up every day with tea bags coffee pods and bottled 💦 water the maids even come around to your room in the evening to restock your water tea bags and anything that you wanted. The bathroom was great with a huge wet room and again well stocked with shower gels etc. Our room overlooked the smaller pool and was very comfortable and quiet. Sun beds around the pool are comfortable the pool was maintained everyday although we didn't use the pool as the water was to cold. We used the Afando Restaurant the food although being a bit pricey was delicious the wine was quite expensive but very nice. The staff were all very attentive and friendly nothing was to much bother conciage and bell boys very helpful and always had a smile. If you have any niggles go to Reception and they will sort out any problem there and then. It was my Birthday whilst we were there just happened to mention this at Breakfast when we got back to our room the bed had been decorated with Happy Birthday covers & cushions on my bed and in the evening chef brought me a delicious cake such a lovely touch. We will definitely be returning to Marrakesh at a different time of the year as February a bit to cold and would have no hesitation in staying at this wonderful hotel.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Darren1017 wrote a review Mar 2018,50,"Perfect stay, Perfect price",I came here with my girlfriend and to be honest this was even better than I had imagined. All the staff from the concierge to the restaurant staff the security and the reception team are very friendly and welcoming. Adil from reception was exceptional and Mourad the manager went above and beyond to make sure we enjoyed our stay in the city of Marrakesh. Massage and a hammam was so good we had to go back for another a few times. Hotel is very central to everything (city centre old market bars mosque) and there are many restaurants and a mall next to it but still has the privacy like a 5 star hotel should.    There were other 5 star hotels double the price we paid here!  but the quality here is of the highest its a no brainer that i will definately will be back the next time i'm in Morocco.,Date of stay: February 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Darren1017
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,SNaidoo2014 wrote a review Mar 2018,30,Not completely 5 star,Beautiful resort style property. I arrived at the hotel today. Check-in is supposed to be 3pm but I had to wait a little while as my room was not ready. Air conditioning only provides heat so you need to open the window. My Problem is the room is still really hot. It’s central heating so you can’t do anything I’m told. The suns glare is blinding in my room and does make the room even hotter. My room would be comfortable if it were cooler. I’m also dissatisfied that my room is so far from the main reception. Had I known this in advance I might have chosen another property. Thankfully my mum did not accompany me as she would never be able to walk the long distance daily. I would not stay here again.,Date of stay: March 2018,,"Johannesburg, South Africa",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SNaidoo2014

We went to restaurant for breakfast without bring my bag with us. I put my bag under the quilt. When I went back to the room I found that the door was opened. When I walked into the room I was shocked that one hotel staff was just rummaging my bag and had already taken out the envelop which I put all cash in it. I asked him what he was doing he told me that he just wanted to check the mini bar!!! Actually there is nothing in the mini bar. I wanted to call reception but he prevent me to do it. He kept saying that he had a little boy and he didn't want to let hotel know. I was a little scared and couldn't imagine what he would do if I insisted to call reception/police. I checked my cash and all other stuff fortunately all stuff were there.  I checked the reviews on booking.com and found that other travelers also comments that the hotel staff entered their room at 3am when they slept.,Date of stay: February 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/meiyiy

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Nitra315 wrote a review Feb 2018,40,Perfect for a quick overnight,I stayed here one night before meeting up with a tour group. The hotel is well-maintained and quite expansive. The room was spacious with a balcony overlooking one of their many pools. Room service was prompt and the food in the restaurant was satisfying. The hotel offered a shuttle service from the airport at 20 Euros each way which is pricey but if you’re not familiar with the area or not comfortable using local taxis it’s a nice benefit. Sadly the weather was not conducive to taking advantage of the outside amenities but in the warmer weather months I imagine this property would be awesome for a family vacation.,Date of stay: February 2018,Trip type: Traveled solo,California,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nitra315

A great 5 star hotel that made us feel very welcome. The onsite facilities were great with the outdoor/indoor pools.    Mourad was the guess relations contact point and was very passionate about customer service and went out his way to ensure we were happy with our stay.    I thought in general there were a few names such as Fatima at the reception and at night reception workers called Khalid ousamah who went out of their way to ensure we enjoyed our stay.    Great location to menara mall (next door) and other eateries shisha/clubs bars if that's what u want.    10mins from the airport and 5 mins to jema ul fina (market) by car seriously u cant go wrong.

Two large swimming pools ( empty because it is so cold ! )and the sun beds are extremely comfortable  The rooms are large and made up every day but they are tight on tea bags and milk and after getting tired of seeking out the maid trolley we bought tea bags and milk from the supermarket next door.  It’s bizarre that we have to sneak in purchased tea and milk ( against the hotel rules) to make up for the lack of free tea bags and milk !  They have also run out of beer on tap - again bizarre for such an up market hotel.  The hotels and shopping precincts are safe as there is security at every door !

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,lhow5 wrote a review Feb 2018,10,An exhausting experience,I stayed in an executive room for 6 nights in November.  I had reasonably high hopes for my stay. Given it was a Savoy hotel I thought it reasonable to set the bar high. I was wrong. It turned out to be a very odd not to mention exhausting experience and I was very pleased to leave.    The hotel was undergoing extensive building works. Being forced to listen to drilling and renovation works whilst reading by the pool was not relaxing. The noise was deafening in the lobby and the vibrations woke me very early most mornings. Despite the glorious weather the pool was too cold to swim in. In addition the hotel had placed its conference centre right next to one of its swimming pools so I had Marrakesh's movers and shakers wondering around my sunbed on their mobile phones. I learnt something new – that there's something strangely disconcerting about wearing a bikini when the person next to you is in full business attire.    My room was spacious. The bed linen was so baubelled it made me skin itch but housekeeping soon sorted the issue. I also had a large balcony with sun lounger that received no sun - no matter what time of day.    The hotel has a policy that guests are not allowed to bring in food or drink from outside. This policy seemed to have backfired spectacularly. Rather than guests being able to enjoy a glass of wine on their balcony followed by dinner in one of the restaurants the hotel was a ghost town in the evening. I paid £15 for a tasteless pizza from the Italian ‘themed’ restaurant on the first night. On the plus side I discovered the mall next door is well worth a visit and serves authentic Morrocan cuisine at local prices.    The service: Early on in my stay I was told ( incorrectly) that the gym didn’t open until 9am. I learnt that it was difficult to fit in a decent workout before getting to the breakfast room where kitchen staff were efficiently clearing away food before I had a chance to help myself to breakfast. On complaining about the standard of the food that was left the staff made an extraordinary fuss and bought me a huge plate of freshly cooked food. The amount of food was obscene and it was a misjudged attempt to rectify the situation. Shortly after this I happened to see a printed copy of an email with my name on it with the title ‘incident report’. It suggested that ‘this guest would 'Benefit' from a complimentary visit to the spa and sauna’. Why not just provide guests with a decent level of service rather than placating them with complimentary tidbits?    As the week went on I decided to try and speak to someone about my experience.  This was not so easy. Staff were fixated on job titles often introducing themselves as manager supervisor head of guest relations- the list goes on. A number of senior managers generally dressed in dark coloured suits were unfortunately arrogant and chippy.    The majority of staff spoke very little English. Rather than saying they didn't understand they often smiled giving the impression they understood but then very quickly disappeared. Expect to ask three people the same thing.    Several members of male staff seemed to think it was appropriate to invite me to join them for dinner or a day out. It wasn’t. It never will be.    Check out was disappointing. An attempt to correct a mistake on my bill resulted in 5 members of staff getting involved – all for the price of 1 cocktail. That pretty much summed it up for me.    The Savoy Le Grand aspires to deliver 'world class service' fastidious service but completely lacks the finesse to deliver.    In my opinion its not for those who are looking for understated luxury and exceptional service.  Its ridiculously overpriced- the assumption being that if you have money you’re happy to part with it – that somehow you don’t expect quality in return.    There were some delightful staff. The pregnant lady who served me breakfast always did so with a warm smile and the ladies in the spa were very pleasant. House keeping were genuinely keen to provide a good service and couldn't have been more helpful. One can't help wondering if you swapped the housekeeping staff with the management team whether the experience would have been totally different. I'll never know though. I wish I’d taken notice of the other reviews. The hotel I wanted to stay in was fully booked – and for good reason.,Date of stay: November 2017,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lhow5

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Ariana wrote a review Jan 2018,40,"Excellent location, away from the maddening crowd!",Clearly the Savoy is in a good clean location away from the maddening old Medina - I could never have stayed there in spite of all the talk about riadhs and such places.  Our accommodation was a large and very comfortable deluxe suite with very good amenities jacuzzi tub included - except we were three adults and every day had to beg for three cups three towels three bathrobes three slippers etc. Breakfast was good but the restaurant was freezing cold - we needed our coats/scarves in order to be safe from the cold coming in through widely open doors. December/January seems to be rather chilly in Marrakech!  We found the staff to be rather slow and under-trained - a coffee we ordered at the pool restaurant one sunny afternoon never arrived... One evening 23.00 an extra bed arrives at our door and it was hard convincing them that we had never asked for one - we already had had one for the previous two nights! One early morning someone knocks on our door to check occupancy?!  One interesting and useful feat - the hotel is directly connected to the neighbouring Menara Mall - just make sure you have your room card with you.  We did not try the outdoor pool as the weather was rather chilly. The indoor pool did not impress us much - we would have preferred the water a little warmer or at least the jacuzzi areas. We definitely enjoyed our suite jacuzzi after long and tiring days out exploring Marrakech - the hotel provided perfumed bath salts which were much appreciated!  One other good thing: the hotel is no more than 10 minutes from the airport and that was really helpful especially for an early flight.  Bell boys and concierge services were very prompt and polite reception staff professional and helpful.,Date of stay: January 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Cluj-Napoca, Romania",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ariana_22222

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,darkmarjk wrote a review Jan 2018,10,"No sleep, no point.",We had nice final car journey ready to park our rental car after three weeks of driving Moroccan roads. To end our journey in style we thought we would go for a 5 star hotel.  We arrive and they are still building the hotel it seems. The entrance is lovely and stylish and we are excited with the grand shiny entrance lobby. We arrived a little after check in time and approach the reception desk we are looked up and down then passed on to another unfriendly member of staff that told us to walk around for a bit and then come back. After around 30 minutes we are still waiting for the joke that is check in. We eventually get a room in the back of the hotel possibly the staff quarters. The hallway to the room has a nice view of no mans land scattered with rubbish. The room is okay with a little damaged floor and only decaffeinated coffee and empty minibar. The room is hot. We leave quickly for the pool and enjoy the sun. lunch was great so was the sauna and jacuzzi but for an extra 200d each. Dinner was also marvelous and the restaurant staff great.It all falls apart when we get back to our room. It is to hot and the air conditioning does not work we have a flight at 7am and want a good nights sleep. That is why we pick a 5 star hotel. I try to open the window at the backside of the hotel we hear all the road traffic. I phone reception to ask for help they will send someone round. Then the upstairs room start moving furniture around and screaming I phone reception and they say they will send someone round.. 40mins later and 3 phone calls a maintenance guy arrives with no English and no clue how to fix the air conditioning. Wonderful. My wife loses the plot after this and storms to the reception. Meanwhile I enjoy the events of the furniture removal party above me. My wife returns with a key to another room after telling the receptionist guy that is whats happening. We move harassed and stressed to the other room which is also to hot we give up and listen to the noise from the opened window. Breakfast was delightful but the day ruined because we got no sleep and the reason we picked this hotel was to treat ourselves and get no hassle. What we got was disappointed no sleep and we spent a lot of money on this sadness.,Date of stay: January 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Scottish Highlands, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/darkmarjk

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Hejanace wrote a review Jan 2018,10,First impressions last.,Check in took 45 minutes which it was absurdly unnecessary. We were welcomed by a lady at the reception but a man took over and asked us to go for a wonder around the hotel which we did not want to do because we were tired and all what we paid for was for a room which by the way was very pricy £109 pn. Reception staff was cold and unsympathetic. Once the ostentatious check in was over we were taken to our room by the baggage boy who was nice (we paid him 50 dirhams). The room was located in the left sided building of the complex although the room was nice but a bit tired looking. The mini bar was not stocked in at all so we could not buy anything that we wanted. The room temperature was a big problem as it was impossible to change the settings to a cooler temperature so we phoned the main reception and asked for someone to come fix it. Half an hour later we were still waiting so I rang again. The man on the phone said someone was coming and indeed a young man arrived with no English but French which made everything even more annoying because we did not speak french and being at a 5* hotel one would expect that issue not to be a problem. The man advised us to switch off the air conditioning which we did but it was too hot. 5 minutes after he came round and did nothing other than upset us even more by not resolving the problem. I phoned again and the receptionist said he will send someone else which arrived at almost an hour after we complained. Roaring as a lion I went down and met this man on the way which again did not speak other than french and Arabe so communication was not fluid. Fed up with the situ I went to the main reception to ask for a solution and I was offered nothing but more excuses so I asked to be moved to another room due to the noises coming from the room above and also the heat. The man offered me a room in the same building but above the one we had so I rejected it and eventually he gave me a room in the building beside which by the time we got in it was 1 am. We could not sleep due to someone's children playing in the corridors and still shouting at that time in the night which made everything unbearable. We understand that everybody pays for what they want but some rules must apply for everyone regardless of their position or wealth. The hotel is still under construction and noises were heard throughout our stay. The pool area was lovely and very pristine. Alfredo restaurant was very nice and the service delivered by the chef from Agadir and the man who served us was outstanding so I'd like to thank him for his warm welcome and friendly attitude. The best thing without doubt was the breakfast which was just amazing with a huge selection and display of different foods. My husband and I were sleep deprived and that triggered a long 4 days of a migraine attack on me. We felt discriminated in the way we were treated and also the room we were given. (The second room given had everything and the minibar was full). The hotel is beautiful and elegant but the policies they have let this place down. If you have never been in a 5* hotel then give it a go as a novelty thing but if it's quality what you look for then definitely go somewhere else because this place is opulent and although it may look appealing to the eye it is soulless and all about the money. Rudest staffs ever for a 5* hotel. A detrimentally poor experience!! BEWARE Not all what it shines it's gold.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,BuuBuu16 wrote a review Jan 2018,40,Another great visit.,Another fantastic stay!    Located 10 minutes max from the airport it is conveniently located.    Check in was a bit disappointing this time as we did not get what we booked and needed to change rooms the next day to get what we originally booked.    Room we eventually ended up in was fantastic. Good size well decorated and clean. Lovely bathroom and great seating area. Air conditioning worked well also.    Location is very good with Menara Mall on your door step as well as The Buddha Bar.    One disappointment was the problem we had bringing in milk and crisps for our babies. We were told we could not bring in any food whatsoever. After a heated conversation we were eventually allowed to. The whole thing was ridiculous if you want my opinion. That rule is also outdated! So please update it!    Service on the most was outstanding and special thanks to the chief concierge Mehdi who looked after everything we needed during our stay.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Philippa R wrote a review Jan 2018,30,Mixed experience,We got back Sunday from a 4 night stay at this hotel. Firstly we couldn't fault the hotels facilities. The SPA indoor pool quality of our room the decor and the luxury furnishings were 5*. However there is construction work going on near the main pool area and there was constant pneumatic drilling! We came for a quiet getaway after a hectic Christmas and New Year and felt very let down that this wasn't pointed out to us before we confirmed our booking. There is NO DOUBT we would have stayed elsewhere had we known. When checking out we were asked why we didn't ask to change rooms. This was because we walked around the entire grounds and found you couldn't escape it. We'd booked a suite with a pool view so we could have a large private terrace to laze quietly in the sun. At least we had the view!    Construction aside we would have to rate this hotel 3*/4* on service with the exception of a few individuals and in particular the Outlets Manager Jawad Kourti who was excellent. If everyone emulated him they'd be 5*. Our plates weren't cleared we had to get up to go to the bar three times in one evening to order a drink whilst others around us were being waited on by 2 people the Please Do Not Disturb sign on our room door was ignored. These things didn't bother us too much and made us laugh but having stayed at the Waldorf Estoria in Amsterdam recently and paid a similar amount of money there is no comparison.    We had a number of treatments in the SPA and they were all very good. The food at Alfredos was also very good. Some of the food we had in the lobby bar was below average.    A general note to anyone that hasn't been to Marrakesh airport before make sure you have all your patience to hand. It took us over 1.5 hours to exit when we arrived and more that that to get through to the departures lounge when we left. We were travelling with hand luggage only and still had to queue at check it desks to get our boarding passes validated. Superb security ;) including one right at the entrance to the airport where we had to queue 20 mins to enter. Thankfully it had stopped raining but if not we would have got soaked.,Date of stay: January 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Albufeira, Portugal",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PhilippaR480

You will get cheaper room than from the other sites.  - 2 weeks before our arrival I received email from the hotel asking to provide my complete credit card details for a prepayment. The whole email was very ridiculous and I would never disclose my credit card details to anyone without secure trusted system. I simply told them the facts of online safety and they answered they need to do this. I answered my booking contract doesn't mention about ""prepayment"" and never heard from them again. Even this is very poor communication from a 5 star hotel this kind of behavior is very common in Morocco. Still never provide your complete credit card details via email. We got our hotel room even we refused to play by their highly risky rules.  - Swimming pool area is very nice breakfast is superb room is very comfortable. You will enjoy staying here.  - There is also Carrefour you can go for shopping and even buy alcohol but carrying alcohol back to the hotel is forbidden - the security will check your handbags every time when you arrive to the hotel.  - The food and beverages are very expensive. I didn't care to try them with that price.  - We really enjoyed our time in this hotel! Because of the very weird episode with the email and high prices for every extra service given rating is only 3 stars.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,O J wrote a review Jan 2018,20,Let down by service,The reason you pay more for a five star is to have an enjoyable holiday which is comfortable and luxurious with a good service. Unfortunately this place massively lets you down on service.  It potentially could have been a lot more than it is.    Positives:  On the cheaper side  Grand feel with the lobby and the main pool  Inside pool is pretty big and nice  Breakfast included  Staff TRY to make you feel special  Next to menara mall although the mall is nothing special if you have experienced even a very average UK mall.    Negatives:  Run down in places  A number of things in the room weren't working on check-in such as the safe some of the room lights corner lamp which got resolved after having an electrician for about half hour  Worst shower of any hotel I have stayed in ever no star or five star honestly. You either freeze or burn!  Staff don't understand English properly and possibly that is the reason for them unable to help despite the fact that they keep smiling at you.  Cleaning is not up to scratch.  You have a checking of your stuff entering the property which unfortunately I became a victim of unaware of their policy of no food and drink from outside. Considering they have a superstore right next to them I was bringing in a bottle of wine and nuts in the store's bag completely unaware i was breaking the law I was stopped the bag checked and in a very degrading way the items taken away and I was talked to. I was furious and demanded to see the manager. On meeting their customer relations manager Nora I was surprised to know that it is their financial strategy not to allow food and drink from outside. She made absolutely no attempt to try and make it better. Would have made sense if I was trying to smuggle something into a jail! If only I was aware of I would not have faced the embarrassment which truly messed my day up. You don't go on a holiday and stay at a 5 star to be shamed and embarrassed. Painful experience!    All in all what could have been a great stay unfortunately was greatly let down by poorly trained staff and I certainly wouldn't be returning. If my stay was flexible I would have moved even if it meant paying significantly more for somewhere better for instance sofitel (awesome in Casablanca experienced just the day before).,Date of stay: January 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Leicester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/omerj2014
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Viktorija2012 wrote a review Jan 2018,30,Not a 5 star ....,Hotel location: good. 10 min drive from airport    Arrival: All was smooth and even though we arrived early we didn't wait for the room very long . So it was nice    Housekeeping: Rooms cleaned on daily basis not a problem for whatever you ask. Most of them do not speak in English but i didn't find it difficult - just show what you want you get it in next few min. So well done to HSK team.    Security: This is where the fun part starts. Bag search when you coming back to the hotel. Seriously not nice when someone is looking into your bag and puts their hand in... I have been asked to through away the bottle of coke that i had in my bag because you are not allowed to bring any food or drinks to the hotel! Its like in airport that you have to think what you have in your bag before returning to the hotel. Do you really consider this being normal? Second evening we went to Buddha Bar and i had just my purse with me. So fine nobody asked me to open it however i have been asked to present room key. Which is also fine at this stage. As soon as we entered to the hotel another security stopped and asked to show the key.... I am sorry but why do i need to present the key when i am already in the hotel and obviously to get into the hotel i had to pass via security at the front door? Never mind... on our way to the room another security was RUNNING after us asking where are we going and once more asked to show the key to prove that we are staying in the hotel.. Seriously?? how many times i need to be stopped before i reach my room? I felt offended and it ruined my mood for the rest of our holidays as you always need to think what you have in your bag and ensure that you have a key in your hand just in case someone will ask to prove that you are staying there...    Concierge: We booked transfer via concierge team. Asked this amount to be posted to my room bill. Sadly at 4am when checking out i was informed that transfer is not book and they have no drivers available. On top of that no solution was offered. When i said that i have no cash to pay fro the taxi (in Morocco you have problem exchanging dirhams back to you euros) the only solution was use cash machine and be charged for transaction fee +exchange fee. No discount offered. Manager said that taxi will cost 100 dirhams but driver at the airport asked for 150... I thought that manager would talk to the driver and advise not to take more money from us for the inconvenience that we experience but no. Why they need to bother themselves...    Managers: Last day while having breakfast one of the managers approached and asked how was our stay. I said that it was kind of ok. He said he will let us finish breakfast and will come to get more details. Just before we finished breakfast he walked away and obviously never approached us again. Maybe he expected us to wait for him? i had 2 coffees after breakfast so i believe i have waited long enough.    Its not 5* star hotel for me as customer service is the worst that i have ever experienced.

A not too far walk for us to koutoubia mosque Place de Marché Animée Jemaa el-fna and the medina (about 1.6 - 2.2 km) and not far from Les Jardins de la Ménara in the other direction. We had a room with a large balcony about the central pool.  My only complaints are petty -- if you offer a heated pool you should also have robes easily available (they came quickly once we called the front desk) and the coffee maker should come with not one but two mugs.

I have travelled the world and stayed in many hotels but this is the worst experience I have ever had!!    Firstly check-in was a nightmare! There were insane lineups and no one to help. They couldn't even find the booking. Extremely inefficient and apathetic staff that doesn't care about it's customers. Also the property is very different than in photographs - it is very dated!    The scariest part of our experience was when at one point in the middle of the night we heard these crazy screams from above and it seemed like a domestic dispute. As the screams got louder we got concerned and called the reception. We advised them that we couldn't sleep and we also were concerned for the safety of the woman whose screams we were hearing. Given we were women on our first trip to Marrakech we felt unsafe. The hotel offered no support and no explanation! We woke up exhausted as we hadn't slept all night and requested a ONE HOUR extension on checkout and were denied. We had to speak to a manager to get her to approve this.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,KayKhanom wrote a review Jan 2018,40,Beautiful Hotel & Lovely Staff,This is a lovely gem of a hotel. The grand hotel entrance is stunning with its high ceilings and spacious aesthetically pleasing decor. We arrived a little earlier then the check in time. With 10 adults and & 3 children to accommodate they were very speedy in receiving us and processing us through to our rooms. Altogether we had booked 5 rooms. 4 Doubles & 1 Suit. We were given rooms off the same landing on the ground floor. The pool view is lovely. The Garden View is pleasing to the eye but nothing special.    Ideally we would have liked to be a level or 2 up from the ground floor but these were the rooms they had available. The rooms were all clean well maintained serviced and room service as well as house keeping were impressive. One morning our of the 8 night stay i wasn't very well and the restaurant staff sent breakfast to our room. The waiter noticed I wasn't with my husband and the rest of the family and asked where I was which I found to be very attentive and special.    The Hotel pool was too cold for us to use however we made good use of the Indoor pool Spa facilities & the jacuzzi in the spa area. The Spa is a little over priced for some of the offerings but overall a very pleasant experience. If you are not planning to venture out this is a lovely spa to spend plenty of time in. All 5 of us women (Ages between 28 - 59) enjoyed our treatments & pampering.    The big buffet restaurant had plenty breakfast Lunch & dinner options. There are other restaurants in the hotel too. We tried one by the garden. The decor is in keeping with the environment. The food was tasty The prices are suited to a couple.    Mall is right next door. Food hall upstairs in the mall has a variety of cuisine offerings. There is a door that leads on from the hotel to the mall. Other local shops restaurants & tourist attractions are near by. A short taxi ride away.    Highly recommend this hotel for families that are not looking for a budget basement dive. There seems to be so many of those about. This is definitely a great option for a big family get away as well as couples. Definitely do not recommend a Winter get away here. The hotel is designed for warm weather. The walk from our rooms to the reception was our least favourite in the rain. There is no internal route that we could find. They hotel reception were however; very accommodating to my disabled father in law. Partially paralysed post a stroke they had a wheelchair to hand for any outings we went on.    Hotel is nice and quiet. The beds are cosy pillows are a dream. Sheets are clean crisp and tastefully decorated. Mini bar stocked well. brilliant bathroom and power showers. Fresh towels toiletries daily. The house keeping is exceptional.    For anyone looking for a good dinner and dance.There is the Buddah Bar next door. My husband & I enjoyed the music drinks and vibe overall.

Savoy Le Grand has everything going for itself when it comes to the location infrastructure facilities etc.... However a huge part of a hotel experience comes from the service. Athough the staff are friendly and helpful the service is lacking...An inordinately long check in process and then as a family of four we get rooms in two different buildings( adjacent/connected rooms was in our reservation confirmation)... then the check in staff offers rooms two different floor....after much discussion we managed to get rooms side by side in the far corner of the hotel.  The showers in bathrooms don't work consistently therefore taking a shower is experience in discovery of hot and cold blasts... worse the tub does not drain and each time after a bath you have to wade out of pool of stagnant water...and if you call housekeeping they will do a temporary fix so you are back to square one next day! The staff while trying to help lack service culture...We asked for tea making faclity in the room instead of a coffee maker in the room... Housekeeping promptly placed a kettle and mugs but the tea bags after the first were not replenished and coffee was refilled regularly... duh!

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Paco E wrote a review Jan 2018,50,Perfect for Relaxed Tours to the City and for a quiet way of Life,"The hotel is located in a new nice area 15 min. walk from Marrakeck downtown. The swimming pool area is the best part. There you can enjoy the sun being attended by nice stewards or see important sport events on a big screen close to the pool.  It has also a very nice indoor swimming pool that is open from 9 to 9. Very important if you have children that pool is very nice too.  We enjoyed a Deluxe room with a king size bed nice terrace with deck chairs and huge bathroom with hydromassage bathtub. Really confortable.  With regards gastronomic restoration the best option is an Italian restaurant with very good quality and quiet ambience where the maitre is also very nice. What I find is that the offer of different restaurants is pretty small nowadays it is important to offer more variety to the gests specially for more than 3 nights stay.  Another important aspect to be highlighted is the great service offered by the Chief Concierge Mr. Ghaghda. This person will help you to organice any tour you may desire with high professionalism and with companies used to VIP guest treatment.  In our case we did a very nice tour to the desert with a really good company ""DONSIMONI MOROCCO TOURS""everything done from the hotel.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Louisa M wrote a review Jan 2018,40,Lovely hotel experience,We loved our stay at Savoy Le Grand. As soon as we arrived we were greeted by the reception staff. Adhil was very helpful and made us laugh. We were a bit early for check in but he sorted us out a room and even upgraded us to a pool view!    The breakfast buffet was great every morning room was lovely and the bed was so big! My only criticism was the staff at breakfast forgot our coffee/juice orders a few times but it was very busy and they were still lovely to us.    The hotel is quite a walk to the main town area around 30-40 minutes. You can get a taxi for around 50 dirham for two people. This wasn't so bad for us but just be aware it is not super close to the main area.    Food at Bella lounge was really good I had a great caesar salad. Buddha Bar next door is also very nice.,Date of stay: January 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Sydney, Australia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Louisamcs

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,motheroftwomonkeys wrote a review Dec 2017,30,Could be better for 5 star,Overall it was a good stay however room was quite dusty in certAin obvious areas and last 2/3 days housekeeping were not on top of their game. We had to request items or services frequently such as for them to provide water or empty the bins.  Also at breakfast had to ask 4 different staff at least 7 times for tea and eventually did arrive once I had eaten.  The worst situation was when we requested late checkout (as our flight was in the evening and it was raining so didn't want to be out and about) concierge staff informed us of a price and we agreed. When it came to settling that bill the price was double than what we were told. We tried to argue this and they basically implied my husband and I were both lying which is ridiculous and insulting!

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Niddi34 wrote a review Dec 2017,40,Second visit’ nice hotel and brilliant staff Kaoutar Ahylege,Second time visit to Savoy. Hotel and overall service was brilliant. Unfortunately the weather was not so good. As a suggestion when the weather is not so good the hotel should think of indoor activities to keep people entertained.    My positive feedback and experience was regarding a particular staff who was called Kaoutar Ahleyge who worked in the main restaurant as a host. She was genuinely very welcoming and engaging in conversation.    She went above and beyond by always being very attentive and recalling and rectifying concerns. Always very bubbly and charismatic’ staff like Kaoutar are an asset to the hotel and could see her developing at ease into a further senior role. Her strengths are definitely strong customer relations and satisfaction.    On the contrary i had a negative experience with the main manager (medical physio) at the spa. She was new and was obnoxious and did not have any patience. Due to a bad experience with a massage i was told to wait 5 mins to arrive it took her 50 mins leaving me 10 mins to get ready before departure.    Her excuse was that she was busy and questioned me whether she should wait around all day for me? For this level of staff you would expect to be more professional unfortunate that after a nice holiday i was faced with this issue.    I was reimbursed halve of the money which required me to speak to the director.    Overall a good hotel with good service front desk Adil was also very polite and cheerful.    Would recommend coming here’ its connected a small mall so convenient if you fancy something different to eat.,Date of stay: December 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Biddulph, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Niddi34

I booked for New Year's Eve largely in advanced then they contacted me because they do not accept AMEX. I gave my other card number but they did not upload it and simply CANCELLED MY BOOKING.  When I received the e-mail I tried to call them to understand what was wrong and without providing any explanation they told me that my reservation had been cancelled and my room immediately assigned to someone else...  What they could do was only to put me on waiting list.. Of course I sent them to hell and booked a different place.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,theguvner10 wrote a review Dec 2017,50,Perfect short stay break,This was our first trip to Marrakesh and was to celebrate our anniversary. I had read reviews from other guests and was a bit worried. Having said that from the moment we arrived we couldn't have asked for more. The positives: The hotel is located within about 20 mins walk from the main square. On arrival the porters were on hand to take the bags straight away. Checking in was quick and simple (less than 5 mins). Rooms were clean modern lots of space and we got pool and mountain views. Breakfast was included and the food was as good as most large hotels we've been to with a omelette stations large pastry selections etc. The hostess and waiters were really friendly and attentive. The restaurants in the hotel were also very good. A special mention to the chief concierge Mehdi who was very helpful with his recommendations and arranged a dinner for us at a restaurant with a surprise. Another special mention for guest relations staff and particularly Fatima who laid on a very special surprise for us which was a really special touch. All staff were really nice and very friendly as far as we experienced. Negatives: The room only provided 1 cup when there were 2 of us. That's about all the negatives that I can think of which gives an idea of how good a stay this was.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,fredie786 wrote a review Dec 2017,30,Much Better hotels out there in Marrakech,This was the second time we visited Savoy after such a great visit the the first time in March 2017. The second time what a grave contrast- where do I start?  * on arrival waited 2 hours to be checked in hoping the room would be worth the wait  * We weren't shown our room just expected to find our way when we got a little lost and asked the pool boy and security guard they pointed to above the restaurant where the executive suites are (good job we understand a bit of Arabic as the joke was to send us on a wild goose chase).  * When we finally found our room after lugging a toddler with us we were put in a room next to a corner full of cigarette stubs. The toilet had stains to put it politely and the bathtub had not been cleaned and just a few ants crawling around the floor. We had to take pictures to show reception so we could move and guess what they had no where to move us to. So all in all it took 4 and a half hours for us to settle into a standard room.  * When I went to use the indoor swimming pool the next morning I asked the pool guard where I could obtain towels from he stated I would have to go upstairs and get my own from the main pool area. Only to see him come up moments after to get towels for another couple using the indoor pool.  * My 3 year old daughter broke the glass which was not secured on the balcony table and fell straight into it. We called reception for assistance and they just sent cleaners to clean it up. No follow up or recording or accident or to even check if she was ok.  * The only decent service received was from the restaurant staff at breakfast time other than that the receptionist staff were happy to take tips and in turn put you in one of the worst rooms on a promise you will get a better one.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,SamiunSu wrote a review Dec 2017,30,Good hotel. Awful staff.,Stayed here for 5 days with my husband. Hotel was absolutely beautiful. Room was spacious and clean. Location was perfect. Had a supermarket next door top floor of supermarket had nice food places. There were bars and clubs and restaurants close by. Djema el fna was within waking distance. We were having a really good holiday til we were locked out of our hotel room on night. Our room was a bit of a walk away from reception so we had to keep going back and forth. I was pregnant at the time so it was inconvenient. I just wanted to get into the room and rest. We were told the key card was fine and they couldn’t understand why the door would not open. They gave us new key cards three times. Did not help. Staff at reception were unhelpful and looked at us for answers!!! Finally after 3 longs hours we were able to get into our room (12am) turns out there was a problem with the door handle. Could’ve been dealt with completely differently. We are understanding and know these things can happen. But the lack of help from staff was outrageous. They made out like we didn’t know how to use a key card hence why the door wouldn’t open. They didn’t bother to come up and check themselves! Disgrace.,Date of stay: March 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Oldham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SamiunSu

The concierge service - one of the best I’ve ever come across and they are such a useful source of information from restaurants to car hire to offering guidance prices for things you might want to buy/haggle for in the souk.  I lost my passport at the airport and the handsome concierge had phoned everyone in the town get it back within 45 minutes.    On the plus side the room was very comfortable and spacious.  The buddha bar was very nice time probably the best restaurant in the city.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,S K wrote a review Dec 2017,50,"Charming, relaxed, and ubersome people",This hotel was brilliant. Good location lovely pool brilliant friendly staff. Nice quiet relaxed safe place.    Room was clean and spacious with a nice balcony (albeit little view from ours but we didn’t care). Many balconies have super views.    Breakfast was really good wide range of food including local stuff freshly cooked omelettes/pancakes and plenty of fruit and extras. Also other on site restaurants and LOADS to eat nearby.    Be wary of the hotel’s own cars for rent it ran well but a bit beaten up! And no washer fluid.    Didn’t use the hotel bar but it looked very nice indeed.    And it is literally next to a shopping centre which is very handy.    The location puts you 10min drive from airport and 5-15min walk to various key places. It’s very well placed to be in the edge of the salubrious area and so out of the noisy city centre but near enough to walk.    Strongly approve of our stay.    The concierges were all especially helpful and looked after us really well. And ask them the suitable price for any taxi journey tour and some other things.    They trade currency at the hotel at very very competitive rates - almost the market rate. Do NOT try and get Dirham at the airport it had a 35% charge!!!,Date of stay: November 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M5478EYsk
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Ben C wrote a review Dec 2017,50,An oasis of calm in a hectic city...,This has been a very enjoyable stay in a beautiful location! The hotel is a real oasis of calm away from the bustling city centre; definitely the sort of resort you would choose to come for a relaxing break (rather than a Riad in the centre).    This hotel having recently become part of the Savoy group is making real inroads into becoming a consistently 5* resort. Having stayed at the sister hotel in London a few times - it is when the culture is fully embraced that the experience is transformed. There are clearly a number of managers at this resort who have had some training in Europe and are actively trying to turn their colleagues heads towards a customer centric way of life. I read some of the reviews on this page before coming here about guests waiting hours or days for things to not happen; having seen this first hand there were still aspects of this but equally on other occasions requests were over serviced within minutes. I think there is an angle of making sure that you choose the right staff member to assist with the right task; there is definitely a culture of saying “yes” even if it isn’t in the gift of the individual; especially prevalent when there are language issues (English being a 3rd or even 4th language for some staff members). An example of this would be that the front desk reception seemed to have no idea which of the on site restaurants were open on any given night; but when our coffee machine in the room broke - we had a (brand) new one delivered inside 30 minutes... I have no doubt that if we were to return here in 6months time the standards would continue to rise and rise!    Anyway enough of that rambling here are the important things to take away:    The good:  - well equipped and laid out rooms (big bathroom enormous bed big tv with lots of international channels)  - excellent concierge - Mehdi was extremely knowledgable and friendly and helped make the trip really good fun  - the advice about upgrading to a pool view room is worth following they are far nicer! Also there are 2 pool one with music running most of the day and night the other much quieter (but further away)  - the spa is fantastic we can totally recommend the Moroccan bath and scrub!  - the Italian restaurant was superb Hicham the manager really made us feel like we were eating at his home! His suggestions for Moroccan wines were excellent to  - the breakfasts are out of this world - so much variety and choice! We also want to that Mohammad for looking after us; always happy to see us and knowing what we wanted before we needed it!    The bad:  - echoing other reviews - the slowest check in you will ever experience. Ever. If there is more than a few people ahead of you in the queue you may consider going into town and coming back later!  - it’s a big place it takes a few days to work out where everything is. We joked about getting a site map to when we were given a map of the city but were only half joking.  - only 4 of the 6 restaurants / bars were available the week we were here (one under construction one hosting a conference). With one of these being breakfast only and another being the lobby bar evening food on site was not as varied as we would have liked.  - construction noise (relating to the above bar) went on from early morning to mid evening. Not too bad from our floor but we spoke to one woman who had been put in a room only 2 down - poor customer care.  - the facilities / restaurants tend to open when they feel like it; rarely did the times in the brochures in the room tie up with what was shown on the door; even rarer to relate to reality.  - the gap in service for food at the on site restaurants tends to coincide with western Dinner times; but that seems the same as the wider city - most restaurants don’t open till about 20:00    Thank you to all the staff here at the Savoy who made us feel such at home this week!

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,tweaky25 wrote a review Nov 2017,10,Very poor service. Not 5 star as stated!!!!,Arrived at this hotel about 8.15pm local time. We were the only ones checking in but after handing over our accommodation vouchers we surprisingly  had to wait nearly an hour for the staff to give us our room keys. No explanation was given even after I had stressed that 3 out of 4 of us were diabetic and needed to eat soon.    We had 2 rooms for 4 of us and on entering found the rooms quite tired looking and not well maintained.  No gowns or slippers were provided and only one tea cup per room for 2 people. Limited tea bags and sugar milk etc.    Shower did not work properly in one of the rooms and bed linen was dirty. By this time it was nearly 10pm so went to get something to eat.  Restaurants very limited for vegetarians so had no choice but pizza and chips.    The next morning I went to the front desk to report issues with the room in regards to shower not working properly no slippers or gowns lack of tea cups and items to actually make the tea with and was told the issues would be resolved.    The following day still no response in regards to issues I had raised so mentioned it to one of the managers in the breakfast area who made a note of the room numbers and said it would be dealt with that day.    On days 2-3 and 4 we got no sleep as throughout the night workmen were unloading large steel beams off lorries using a mini crane and the noise was terrible.    Day 3 we went for a swim in the indoor pool. Water was cold and floor around pool area very slippy. Again no gowns supplied so requested a member of staff to have some. He called housekeeping who said they will send. 30 minutes later still no gowns so i called housekeeping. Still no gowns so had to walk back to rooms in wet swimwear. By this time it was quite chilly so we all ended up catching a cold.    Feeling quite annoyed by now I went to the main front desk and requested to speak to a manager.  I was approached by Mohamed Abouzya and so relayed my various complaints to him.  3 days into my holiday without a shower that functioned properly.  No robes or slippers which in the grand scheme of things is not a big deal but as a 5 star hotel this is expected especially if they are not given to you in the pool area.  One mug to drink tea out of for 2 people with 1 teabag and 2 sugars. Does house keeping not see this when cleaning rooms. 5 star......REALLY???  Ok so Mohamed said he will deal with issues.  Sent gowns and slippers....  Sent maintenance guy for shower who tightened a couple of bolts and left. I had explained to him it was clearly a water pressure issue but a difference in language proved difficult to explain.  Mohamed said he will investigate the other issues and come back to me the next day as I had said this was unacceptable in a 5 star hotel. Thats what I paid for and thats what I should get.  Of course the next day came and went and no response from Mohamed. I asked to speak to him in the evening but was told he was not there.  Neither him or any other manager spoke to me or contacted me furthermore.    During check out the check out clerk tried to charge me for items taken from the mini bar.  I explained we had not even opened the fridge never mind eat or drink items from there.  I asked what he was charging me for to which he responded 7UP and Sprite.  I proceeded to explain to him that both my wife and I are diabetic and we do not drink canned sugary drinks and there was no way we had these items.By this time he was quite irate in response to my refusal to pay 100 dirhams for items I never had.  I asked him to call the person who supposedly replenished these items in the mini bar to which he did. When he arrived I asked him to tell me the date and time these items were restocked back in the mini bar to which he responded he did not know.  I was amazed that a 5 star hotel did not keep a detailed inventory of what items were taken and when they were restocked so I refused to pay.  Another check out clerk then dealt with the situation and wavered the charge but its ridiculous that I was being asked to pay for something I did not take.    Finally I was asked to pay additional local tax. This equated to nearly £50 extra for the two rooms. I showed him my accommodation receipt clearly outlining total monies to pay and that indeed it had been paid. I said I will call my Travel agent to confirm and again he got very irate started raising his voice and throwing his arms in the air saying you must pay.  I was quite distressed by this time and just walked away. I was advised by the Travel agent to pay and they will deal with it on my return.  Luckily I had 3 hours to go before my flight as check out took nearly another hour.    In summary I would ask you to note the following.  On entering the hotel it appears very luxurious but the rooms are tired looking and certainly not 5 star quality.    The indoor pool is cold and to make money for an extra 200 dirhams you can access the spa for 1 hour to use there heated jacuzzi. Ive never come across this in a 5 star hotel before but what some people will do to make extra money is ridiculous.    The restaurants are limited and prices are extortionate. Better to eat out and local.  The hotel has a policy to not allow guests to bring any food or drink in from outside which again is crazy. You could understand if it was a full meal but to confiscate a bag of crisps or a bottle of water is beyond belief. Your bags are checked every time you enter the hotel to enforce this.  Again this is another way of making money by charging extortionate amounts for water and snacks.    I found front desk staff and all managers extremely rude and unapproachable. Its almost like you should consider it a privilege that they have allowed you to stay there.    Pools both inside and out are cold but for an additional payment you can lie in warm water. Again a money making scam.    The General manager of the hotel should review his staff and train them in customer service relations. They should respond to all complaints and relay back to there guest any queries that have been addressed or more importantly not.    This was my first time in Marrakech and in regards to the city and people I cant fault it. They are wonderful and its an experience not to forget.  In regards to the Savoy. I will never return there. There are many other options in far better hotels.  I will be taking my hard earned money to places where its appreciated and where the customer really does matter.  Be savvy with the money you've earned.If you're booking 5 star then you should expect that level of accommodation and service.  I visited other hotels whilst out there and some are by far superior to the Savoy for the same cost.,Date of stay: November 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,Harrow.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Mohammed A wrote a review Nov 2017,10,Very rude receptionist !!!!,This is my second time staying at savoy and unlike my first time I was shocked with the treatment at the front desk. A receptionist named Samira which was extremely rude and racist did not make my check in smooth. Firstly she made a mistake with my personal details and when I pointed out the issue she accused me of being closed minded !!!!!!!. I mentioned to her this is not a way you address customers and give them attitude she basically argued and ignored my comment. After a long checkin process I overheard her talking badly about me to my friend which is absolutely unprofessional and an unhealthy reaction from a staff working for a 5 star hotel. Savoy is a good hotel however I believe if they want to posses a 5-star standard rank they need to work on hiring professional staff who can handle diversity and be open minded. The last thing you want as a receptionist is a racist irresponsible person who definitely will undermine the hotel status. The receptionist is the vitrine of the hotel. And having a professional receptionist is a key to a successful hotel. This incident will be shared in all travel website and I will not recommend this hotel to any of my acquaintances due to this bad treatment I really hope that savoy management take my comment as a friendly advice otherwise they will start losing loyal customers,Date of stay: November 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mohammedaI7410ON

The hotel is beautiful the pool facilities are brilliant with a variety of comfortable seating available breakfast was amazing with all the staff being welcoming and quick to help (particularly Mustapha!)and our room was modern and very spacious.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,DG55 wrote a review Nov 2017,20,Bad service and a bad experience,"We stayed at the Savoy for a long weekend break in Marrakech to celebrate a birthday. The hotel seemed to fit the bill as it is touted as a five-star luxury resort style property but is a short distance from the Medina - which meant we could easily visit the sights but retreat back for some much needed relaxation.    On first glance the hotel is indeed impressive large rooms all with balconies two large outdoor pools a spa and several restaurants. However shortly after arrival our initial expectations were quickly shattered.    We arrived late in the evening and the reception area was quiet however the check-in process was not smooth. There were several guests at the desk and it felt like it took a long time to get through each one - ours was the same seemingly complicated with several steps talking to colleagues checking the computer flicking through papers - frustrating after a long flight. Staff did not seem overly welcoming on first impression discourteous and abrupt. After 10 minutes at the desk it seemed there was a problem from what we could gather from bits of overheard conversation between two stroppy members of staff. They told us to sit down and they will be with us shortly. Without so much as an apology a second member of staff eventually declared that the king room (which we had pre-paid several months prior) was in fact not available and they could only offer us a twin room for our first night and we would need to move to the king room the following day. Disappointing as we didn't welcome the extra hassle of moving rooms on such a short break and especially so as it was a special occasion. The staff member justified it to quote: since we are staying three nights at least we would still get two nights in the correct room. The attitude was incredibly insincere and unprofessional.    We set this initial experience aside and settled for the proposed change of room. Rooms are large and all feature a balcony with pool or resort views and the beds are comfortable - however thats where the luxuries end. On closer inspection the rooms are fairly tatty and decoration appears to be done on the cheap - damaged furniture rough paint and tile finishes and untidy sealant in the bathroom. The rooms are overall average there are no big issues and it would probably pass as a standard 3 star hotel however in this case it is very disappointing and certainly not worthy of a five-star luxury resort.    On the first night we explored the hotel in search of a meal and a few drinks before bed. The hotel guide touts the three restaurants and bars which were all still open according to the opening hours. In reality we found the hotel to be very quiet very few guests around and some of the restaurants completely or partially closed which seemed odd. We eventually found one of the restaurants we asked the staff on the door which restaurants were open and we were given confusing answers and a few menus handed to us taking matters into our own hands we walked into the adjacent bars to find out where we could get something to eat - staff were almost nowhere to be seen. We eventually found that we could order food from the bar and we can only guess that because the hotel was so quiet they had resorted to closing the restaurants and simply serving food in one of the bar areas. Once sat down with menus the service was simply a chore staff would not take our order at first - so we had to go to the bar to ask someone to come over. After we had eaten the staff wouldn't come over to offer more drinks and it was a hassle to ask for the bill.    Judging by the prices it is easy to guess why the hotel is so incredibly quiet at night - the prices are outrageous 80 dirham for a small glass of wine - for UK guests this is over 6 GBP. Due to the price and inept service this was the first and last time we bothered eating or drinking at the restaurant. The good news we thought is that there is a large supermarket right next door to the hotel where we could stock up on snacks and drinks which we could perhaps enjoy in the room or on the balcony. This was another expectation which was quickly shot down by the fact that the hotel has a stunning policy that you are not allowed to bring any food or drink (including water) into the hotel from outside. Having stayed at hundreds of hotels all over the world I have never experienced anything of this sort they also actively enforce this by searching bags every time you enter the hotel - not for your safety but to stop 'contraband' goods from entering. The hotel puts this policy down to 'not being able to control the food standards' of external food and drink however I think this is clearly a ploy to try to force you into buying the extortionate goods within the hotel which is fairly despicable.    The second day we were scheduled to move rooms given the issues with our room on check-in. After breakfast we called reception to check the status of the new room - the member of staff said they would send a bellboy up to take us to the new room right away. An hour passed and there was no sign of the bellboy we called reception again to ask if they were coming the second member of staff didn't know but would ask the first member and call us back 'right away'. Thirty-minutes later there was no call so we took matters into our own hands and took all our luggage back to reception to get the new room key for ourselves. We were fairly furious by this point not only because of the lack of communication but also because we were essentially wasting half of first day simply trying to change rooms which the hotel had messed up originally. When we arrived at the desk after queueing again the staff member exclaimed that the room had 'just' become available - different information from what we had been given 1.5 hours ago. Finally with the new key in hand we were able to settle into the new room.    Oddly there was a letter in our new room which was clearly meant for another guest inviting them to a special event which was dated the day before our arrival. We could only assume that the guest was either given a different room or did not turn up meaning that in fact this room had been available when we had checked in the previous night. Given this revelation combined with the fact that the hotel was very quiet we can only assume that the check-in staff were either being very stubborn or slightly inept - we cannot fathom why we could not have been given the correct room or a suitable alternative at the start. To add insult to injury the air conditioning did not work in our new room but by this point we had little confidence in that being resolved quickly and decided to bare with it.    Generally staff around the hotel give a ""couldn't care less"" style attitude. Even though the hotel felt relatively quiet it felt they were never proactive whether in the bar restaurants or even around the pool area. No one would come round to take drink orders at the pool or help out with the sun beds and parasols.    Overall a very disappointing experience. The hotel seems to have some of the correct ingredients for a great resort but it falls down on so many levels.    I would only consider recommending this hotel if you were only looking for a hotel to sleep and shower on a short trip between heading into the Medina during the day. I would definitely not recommend the hotel as a resort or anywhere to spend more than a very short amount of time and I would not recommend for a special occasion.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Marta Rocha wrote a review Nov 2017,30,Lacks that extra mile in service that makes the difference in a 5* Hotel,The building has the comfort and luxury you expect in a 5* hotel but it misses the quality service that's expected.    On the first day we had to ring reception to ask for our bags after more than 30 min waiting for them to be delivered to our room.  Only one Restaurant open at night Italian way overpriced for the service.  I order a carbonara and they understood Aribiata (that is supper spicy). Same thing happened on another table next to our. Order two bottles of wine and they had none of them. After asking the second bottle (which they didn't have despite it was on the list) the restaurant manager arrived with a suggestion and finally solved the problem. The home made chocolate mousse as they say was for sure not home made and was served frozen. The roasted pineapple with passion fruit sorbet was in fact canned pineapple barely roasted with vanilla ice cream (?!). My husband is lactose intolerant and cannot eat ice-cream. Imagine if he was allergic!  We spoke to the RM at the end and the only thing he did was inviting us to come back again on the next day (no thanks).  On the third day I got bitten by dust mites while sleeping (which i'm allergic to). That tells a lot about the mattress cleaning.    On the positive side: the breakfast buffet freshly made every day and with a lot of different bread and pastry options egg show-cooking fresh orange juice and the staff was very pleasant and attentive.  The outdoor swimming pools are good although some of the towel need to be replaced.  The bedroom is big and has everything you need for a nice stay.,Date of stay: October 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Porto, Portugal",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrCp2009

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,SheilaSara wrote a review Nov 2017,40,Luxurious Hotel,I stayed here for three nights with my daughter. I was celebrating my birthday. I asked if they could recommend somewhere for fine dining at their hotel or outside for this celebration. They said they would let concierge know.  Unfortunately I didn’t hear from concierge. He may have been busy. I personally found a restaurant which I did ask concierge to book for me.  The room was lovely spacious. Beds comfortable. Breakfast was ok. A lot of middle eastern dishes. Which personally were not to my liking. However the omelette station was fantastic. As was the pancake chap. There were breads and yogurts. Several pastries.  The breakfast staff were very attentive polite and knew what I liked by the second day. They always served with a smile.  Swimming pool: this was very big. However quite cold. The sun beds and loungers around the pool were plentiful and comfortable. My daughter and I stayed here most of the time. The pool is surrounded by lush plants and flowers.    The hotel is connected to a shopping mall. This is handy if you want to buy snacks  have ice cream shop.    The hotel is located in the New Town. Taxis are plentiful. Expect to pay 50 dirham to the old town. About 30 for local places.    Cons: if you buy alcohol from outside the hotel you cannot bring it in to the hotel. It will be confiscated. They do however serve alcohol at the hotel. It is very pricey.    I found front desk rather obtuse. When I asked a member  I would like to speak to concierge she pointed at his empty stand!  and said over there. Knowing very well that no one was actually there. Which is why I’d asked her in the first place!  Secondly she shouted across the front reception area in very loud tone to the bell boy to find concierge. This is not something one would expect of the Savoy. People sitting and relaxing don’t want to hear a women shouting across the whole area. Would of been professional if she’d walked to the bell boy.    Maybe some retraining for front desk is due. Sorry to say.

Beautiful Hotel & Vibes,I stayed at Savoy Le Grand with 2 other friends from the 17-24th Oct 2017 I have to say it was an amazing memorable stay. The Hotel is beyond beautiful.  From the time we arrived to the time we left all the staff were extremely helpful and always willing to go beyond to make our stay even better and comfortable.    We stayed in room 2419 the rooms are huge we choose the twin bed room they added an additional bed for my friend (same size) even after having 3beds in our room there was plenty of space to move around. We had an amazing room the balcony was very big with stunning views of the main pool we didn't feel once it was noisy although the music was enjoyable and holiday vibes.    I must say the breakfast variety is spoilt for choice there is a lot of choices weather you decide to eat croissants eggs fruits yoghurt moroccan specialitiesfresh juices and the list goes on. A huge thanks to the breakfast team very swift service and always greeting with a smile every morning.    I spent most of my time by the main pool it was very relaxing enjoyed the variety of light music. Also the guest's at the hotel were very friendly.  There is also a 2nd pool more on the quiet side so if you wish to relax away from the music you may want to spend your time there.    All in all it was an enjoyable stay the staff were exceptional and friendly. I have to mention a special thanks to Mourad and Nora from the guest relation team who were very friendly easy to talk with and always ready to help.  Mourad and Nora also helped me arrange a birthday cake for my friends 21st Birthday whilst we were staying at the hotel. Thank you the cake was delicious.    There is a nice mall around the corner from the hotel also it can be accessed via the hotel doors (Need a room key) only for hotel guests to enter and exit. Nice choices of shops restuarants and supermarket.    I highly recommend this hotel to anyone travelling with Friends family couples solobusiness.

Quilt covers had small rips linen napkins frayed bathrobes a little tatty and the chairs in the business suite were beyond acceptable for a 5* hotel. That said the staff more than made up for this they were extremely polite and helpful and nothing was too much trouble.  The 2 swimming pools were great and the restaurants were fine but do bear in mind this is a 5* hotel so prices will reflect this.  Top tip is to use the taxi service at the airport as they charge half the price of the hotel shuttle services (70-100 Dirhams vs. 200!)

After booking our pool view room we were very excited about our marrakesh get away but we noticed the service changes at the hotel which have declined. First we had paid extra for a pool view room. However after check in they had put us in a seperate building that has a view on a secondary pool and that's of much lower standard than the main building (smaller bathroom room and tv). When we spoke to the front desk they told us that that's all what they had left... Also a new rule forbids you from bringing any outside food or drinks into the hotel property which is completely ridiculous!! And that applies to water as well! It is really too bad to see such an amazing property with such a poor managment that doesn't even bother to explain the reasons behind it's decisions to the service crew.

However i was completely surprised. Efficient transfer service from the Airport which was under 10 minutes away. Even the transfer was enjoyable going through the main street seeing all the locals on mopeds and kaleshes - the driver was great and gave us lots of information on the way which was very useful. Upon arrival - i was welcomed by happy and smiling team members and a nice refreshing Moroccan tea was served. Check in was quick informative and not too much after a very long journey (22 hours) . My luggage was in the room before i got there! Everywhere is spotlessly clean....they are currently working on new facilities which will make this hotel even more amazing    Suite - was something incredible and beyond what i expected....spacious living room with a gorgeous large L shape sofa spacious bedroom 2 bathrooms (1 with a jacuzzi bath walk in shower sauna and his and hers sinks! Bathrobes and slippers ready in the room. Mini bar was well filled (extra charge) with vodkagin and whisky miniatures as well as the usual soft drinks and water. Tea and Coffee station were refreshed daily as are the capsules for the Nespresso machines. Largest balcony i have ever seen overlooking the pool!    Reception/Concierge - always smiling and very helpul    Housekeeping did a fantastic job - my suite was spotless    Pools are extremely clean and they have lovely sunbeds with mattresses they also had several beds located inside the actual pool - perfect for sunbathing but cooling off at the same time!    Breakfast - loved the buffet breakfast - plenty of variety and something for everyone (eggs cooked to how you want salads huge variety of breads cereals jams vegetables potatoes sausages tomatoes mushrooms cold cuts sweet and savory pastries donuts muffins etc    Bella Lounge - perfect place to relax and have a drink or nice snacks (Savoy Cheese Burger & Chicken Wrap - highly recommended). Service was faultless    Italian - AMAZING service food everything was perfect. I thoroughly enjoyed the local white wine. Mushroom Risotto and Lasagne were delcious!    The best part of staying here is you are in the centre of everything. Not too far from the airport Menara Mall is attached to the hotel so its easily accessible.

The room was nice comfortable beds and huge rain shower which I loved. The pool area was also amazing with two large pools one with quite loud music and one more quiet. Breakfast buffet was included in the price and had lot's of choices omelettes pancakes and fresh orange juice.    The only thing was as some has mentioned before that there is a sign saying you cannot bring any foods and beverages from outside. We didn't get stopped with a half full bottle of water but we kinda felt like criminals when trying to bring it in. (Water is 2 dirham in the Carrefour and 40 dirham in the hotel). Our bags were also always searched when we entered the hotel (even small purses) so felt a bit like an invasion of privacy even if they might have good reason for security.    Other than this we were mostly happy. A bit slow service at the breakfast at times but generally very friendly and smiling employees.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,BrianTT7 wrote a review Oct 2017,40,Ten day stay,We booked this hotel through a travel agent and expected high standards some of which were met some of which weren’t.  We are fairly fair and appreciate that one persons review might not necessarily be true against another.  On arrival we were met by smiling and happy staff and were shown to the check in desk where we were given mint tea whilst waiting. Check in for us took around half an hour in total but we were shortly shown straight to our room which was on the ground floor facing the smaller pool.  We ate at the hotel a couple of times and spent time around the pools with drinks for the majority of day times. Service for drinks was definitely faster around the smaller pool - which we preferred anyway as there was no loud music being played!  The evenings at the hotel were quiet which seemed a shame as the setting is lovely! I do think the pricing of the food at the hotel seemed a little over the top given the quality and sometimes unorganised/slow service.  Breakfast was a very good selection with everything from omelettes to soups crepes and pastries - definitely try to get there before 9am to ensure you don’t have to fight for an outside table!  It is a shame you cannot bring in water/snacks etc into the hotel (managed to sneak some through the side door) as we were having to make sure we were back in time to go to the supermarket!  The rooms were clean and spacious and were cleaned whenever we wanted it doing.  The hotel is situated around 10 mins from the airport a 5 minute taxi from old town and 5 minute taxi from new town which was handy for us!  Overall the rooms are lovely staff seemed friendly yet sometimes disorganised and the location was brilliant.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Luud G wrote a review Oct 2017,50,Outstanding.,My wife and i are dutch and we stayed in the Savoy from 28 sept till 5 oct 2017. It was fantastic. Big rooms big beds every room with a balcony and view on one of the 2 outside pools. One pool with music (in the afternoon) and one pool without music. The breakfast was enormous in variation en choises. The personel and staff were very helpfull and correct (one small remark of me was immediately solved). Special thanks to Raafat for the services during breakfast very helpfull. The Savoy is a 5 star hotel and it is worth every star of it. What can i say more: good functioning airco (which was neccesary with 36 degrees in the afternoon). 5 minutes to the old city centre and 5 minutes to the airport. Marocco has surprised us and the combination of the interesting chaos in the city and the peacefull rest in the hotel (quiet rooms) is great. We would recommened this hotel to everybody.,Date of stay: October 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LuudG

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Efo85 wrote a review Oct 2017,30,Not like Savoy,The hotel is nice rooms are comfortable. Breakfast is quiet good with lots of variety. I asked for a silent room and they gave me one. But you shouldnt expect regular savoy service quality from here. Front desk is extremely slow. It took 1 hr for 4 people to check in and also check out. The cards are easily broken if u keep with mobile phones and you have to walk all the way back to the reception to fix it. Rooms are far away so costs u considerable time. As a result its a nice hotel but poor service quality.,Date of stay: October 2017,Trip type: Traveled on business,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Efo85
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Mercchris wrote a review Oct 2017,30,"A comedy of errors, great potential let down by lazy staff and language problems.","If you expect someone to take your case to the room you may be successful or not.  The room was potentially great with a view over the huge main pool balcony good size even had a Nespresso coffee machine and a kettle though the mini-bar was empty. The bathroom was a good size with good toiletries but the towels often arrive in stages throughout the day. It took three requests to get the safe fixed so it would shut and two for the Nespresso machine. I arrived on a Sunday and there was a group playing on the stage overlooking the pool and they were very good however music was played very loud all day till 23:00 every day that penetrated the room with the windows shut and got rather annoying. I think a room overlooking the smaller pool might be far more restful. One night about 23:30 I ordered room service burger and chips after 45 minutes I called and they denied knowledge of my order yet he said it would be ready in five minutes. I called after five minutes he said 30 so I said do not bother it was too late. At 01:00 there was a knock at the door. I called the laundry and asked for my laundry to be collected at 08:04 and they collected it within 5 minutes. They claim a 3 hour return but I came back at 14:30 and it had not arrived. I called housekeeping and asked if they spoke English they said yes and sent someone to collect laundry. I called reception and they spoke to the laundry and the washing was returned 30 minutes later. I ate at the pool restaurant the first night and it was good service and a good group playing. The next night I sat for 20 minutes without a waiter appearing despite the place being very quiet so I tried the Italian restaurant where I did get served in a tent outside. I tried the pool restaurant the last night and the service was terrible. It took ages to order a drink and I was gasping before I got the wine. The bread was stale I had to ask for butter and they brought two small packs for six rolls. The rolls were so stale I asked another waiter to change them she did but by then my main meal had arrived. The main meal was not what I had ordered I ordered risotto but got potatoes I had to talk to another waitress to be understood that I wanted to eat some bread and olives then have the correct main meal I also asked for butter. The main meal arrived and it was risotto but the beef had been cut up and reheated not replaced so it was chewy not expected for a 5 star hotel. These are all small things that are unnecessary and build up to really make a stay a bad event. I was attending a congress and wanted to relax back at my hotel but there was always a niggle. I reported these safe laundry and room service incidents to the duty manager who promised to investigate and report back he never did. One afternoon I thought I would lay by the pool and I assumed a towel would be brought to me the same as everyone else after 30 minutes I asked at the pool bar and was told the man in the orange top 100 metres away going fast in the opposite direction provides them. I asked where he operated from so I could find him and the pool boy delivering drinks on roller skates said he would bring one in 5 minutes. Of course 5 minutes passed  I was getting really hot and wanted a dip in the pool so I went and asked at the pool bar again this resulted in the manager coming over the pool boy got agitated and squared up to me! He soon backed down when he saw I was pretty annoyed and I actually got a towel some ten minutes later. At this point a group of males arrived and started playing their ""Music"" in addition to the loud piped music I would suggest using the small pool by the Italian restaurant if you want a quiet life and a towel. The Moroccan restaurant never opened whilst I was there despite rave revues from the staff. I used the spa for a massage and they charge you for everything including the jacuzzi the massage was great but make sure you agree to what you are paying for first. The gym was very basic. I went to see the duty manager just before checking out and they turned up 25 minutes late which probably explains why the staff are so bad in general. We spoke and he apologised profusely and asked how he could make it right. Basically I wanted to a meaningful response rather than the usual apologetic diatribe so I asked for the disaster of a meal to be struck off my bill. He said he could not do that I should have complained to the restaurant manager. I said I asked for him three times but he never arrived so I was asking him now he reduced the meal by 25% which was a tiny fraction of the overall bill and promised me an upgrade if I ever went there again. Breakfast by the pool is inviting but the food is limited if you want hot food. There is the usual continental breakfast and Arab equivalent. The service for coffee and orange juice is very slow and can be very rude. During the stay I tried to speak French first but the local dialect is just not French like any spoken in France or even Quebec so that did not succeed. I always asked if they spoke English and sought out people who claimed to but they all say they can speak English with often disastrous results. I doubt I will ever use the promised upgrade.",Date of stay: September 2017,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Hatfield, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mercchris
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,ButcherFamily wrote a review Oct 2017,40,Weekend trip to celebrate a wedding anniversary,The Savoy Le Grand is a great hotel for a fun weekend break. It's location makes it easy to get to from the airport (15 mins) and far enough from the Centre of Marrakesh to be peaceful but close enough to walk in to the Medina if you wish (20 mins)    Our check in took about 30 mins but during this time we were seated comfortably and well looked after by Hamza supplying us with beautiful Mint Tea. The wonderful Murat was also very helpful and attentive taking the time to ask us about our stay and showing us where all the facilities were that he thought we might like to use.    The facilities are extensive and well maintained. The pools are clean and spacious and in October we had plenty of free sun beds to chose from. The live music played at the main pool in the afternoon/early evenings can be a bit loud and intrusive so we found moving to the smaller pool was more relaxing    The rooms we had were in the 3rd building overlooking the smaller pool. They were nice and quiet in the evening and had a wonderful view of the pool and you could see as far as the Atlas Mountains at sunrise! Wonderful.  The bathrooms were spacious and very clean with a lovely selection of complimentary toiletries. The bedrooms were very large and the bed was enormous and nice and firm.  On our second day housekeeping managed to 'forget' to clean our room. A quick call to reception resolved the situation though so it wasn't a huge problem.    The bar off the lobby makes a very good Virgin Mojito but the service can be a little slow. Even when not busy. The waiter on rollerblades that serves you at the main pool is a novel touch.    The breakfast served at the hotel is fabulous with an amazing selection of buffet and made to order food such as omelette. I can recommend the pistachio yoghurt! It was amazing.  The waiting staff were very friendly and helpful and nothing was too much trouble.    We had lunch by the pool on our arrival day and the food was tasty and nicely presented. The waiting staff were friendly and the food arrived promptly.    We had dinner on our last night in the Italian restaurant which didn't quite go to plan! The first bottle of wine chosen was no longer available the second more expensive bottle of wine was corked but finally the third bottle chosen was fine. Unfortunately the main courses had arrived and been half eaten (to save them going cold) before the wine issue was resolved. One of the main courses arrived completely wrong which meant 3 of us ate together and then we had to wait 20 mins for the correct 4th main to arrive. The waiter was very apologetic and after a little chat with one of the hotel managers after dinner they reduced our bill and gave us complimentary tea and coffee. The food when it did all arrive was very good and the cost for dinner (approx £140 for 4 people) was good value.    The security people and metal detector that you have to pass through at the front of the hotel can be a bit daunting and I'm not even sure what they are looking for when they search your bags. Previous reviewers thought it was food and drink but we came through with water and food that we had purchased outside the hotel without any issue.    All in all we thought the Savoy Le Grand was a great hotel and very good value. We will definitely visit again but make our stay longer than 2 days to make sure we see more of Morroco.    Tip. The ability to speak a little French will help when trying to converse with porters and housekeeping staff.,Date of stay: October 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Reading, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ButcherFamily

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,G R wrote a review Oct 2017,40,Beautifull hotel! But need more training on Customer Service..,Me and my husband Stayed at the Savoy for my birthday for a week. After a tiring trip (as the connecting flight was delayed) arrived around 2.30am.    The Negatives: We Met Mehdi at the front desk no welcome at all compared to other places we have stayed..he just didnt seem interested maybe it was the time we arrived as he did look very tired.. but still no excuse to not smile and welcome you or even ask how was our journey! Would you like a drink? etc.. Especially as this hotel is supposed to be 5 stars..but from my experience I think 5 stars service was only aimed at the the rich business tycoons staying at Savoy!    Completed all formalities( during this process was also asked for credit card details which I refused to give).. bellboy arrived took us to our rooms.    And yes not to forget from my room I called front desk spoke to Mehdi again or somone and asked for an adapter for my charger as my battery was dieing.. i was told this will be sent to our room.. and guess what? it didnt arrive and i never bothered calling again as we were too tired..    Next morning called room service for a charger..bellboy arrived ..argued with me as he would not give me the charger without a deposit! Explained had no dhirhams as only arrived in the night and will arrange this later.. he was rude and refused outright! Made yet again another phone call and was told a Manager would call me.. guess what ? No one rang me back!    And also just to mention no one the following day acknowledged that we was here.. no tour of the hotel given or where and who to contact for booking any excursions.. it was like we didnt exist!! (And this was the feeling we had through out our stay at Savoy from majority of the staff)    Pool: Two lovely big pools.. well looked after with some nice sunbeds.    One Saturday the hotel had around 700 people! Sunbeds had towels put down very early and people gone for hours!  Mentioned this to Mohammed the manager who quickly fixed this.. thank you Mohammed for actually listening..as this is one of the issues i had staff not listening to you!    Eventually a lot of extra sunbeds were brought as me and my husband were not the only ones wondering about looking for sunbeds!    POSITIVES:! The breakfast( yummy) staff and the one and only Jawad! Bravo to the team. Thank you Hamza.. lovely and sweet Nora.. your the best guys!    Jawad the breakfast manager was the only attentive staff member I came across..the guy needs to give others training on what customer service is. Honestly he is the most friendliest person around genuinely nice person and very professional..    Always looked out to the guests..making sure tables were served.. at times you would not need to say anything and he would look at you and say 'Did you need anything'! Brilliant!. My husband had a toothache one day and mentioned to Jawad one morning..honestly the guy would ask every day and kept offering to take him to the docter at the hotel.! It was so sweet of him..as with so many guests at the hotel.. he still paid attention to each an all! Thats talent.!    P.s he even dropped me and my husband off to the airport as we had an early morning flight.. that was so nice of him.. thank you so much Jawad! Savoy needs more staff like you.!    Oh and not too mention how Jawad arranged our breakfast to be sent to our room early hours of the morning before we set off to the airport! Spot on service!!

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Momohe wrote a review Sep 2017,40,A hotel for some ME time,By North American standards this hotel is ok. It is like a sooped up Crown Plaza or Sheraton etc. What will impress you is the staff. The teams are very much in synch with each other especially during meals. This hotel is excellent for families as it has many pools and many places to snack outside of meal times. A fitness centre is also available. The rooms are very comfortable and make your stay a nice one. The option of the jacuzzi in the room is awesome also. In the suite I was able to get some work done thanks to the business corner in the suite's living room. Wi-Fi was fast and reliable all times. Proximity to the Airport and the city centre are also additional assets. As an avid traveller using high end and low end service industry this hotel is just right. I would recommend it if you can afford it. Now there are delays in checking if you come during a busy time. However they recognize that and ask you to enjoy the grounds and the huge reception area where coffee and Moroccan tea are served. If you are going to book this hotel please ensure that you leave all the service to the staff and just worry about things to do and visiting the beautiful city of Marrakech. You will be taken care of and made feel very much like a VIP.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,ale3712016 wrote a review Sep 2017,20,"good hotel, poorly managed",The Hotel is well located in a newly built area with many hotels and modern facilities (Menara). At the same time it is walking distance (20m) from the great Mosque and Jamaa el Fna square.  The rooms are nicely furnished and the hotel is structured around the main pool with most of the rooms and balconies facing towards it.  HOWEVER the Hotel seems to be poorly managed the front desk is clearly not organized. It took them 3 (THREE!!!) hours to check us in due to mistakes on their side in the bookings double beds instead of single beds Queen size instead of King size (King Size was booked on purpose) and barely an apology for the inconvenience. We arrived at 6 and were planning on spending an hour in the pool before heading downtown for dinner and despite telling we had dinner reservation the staff kept saying it was only a matter of minutes. We were looked down and treated condescendingly in a idiotic attempt to sound funny. Similarly we experienced other minor service flaws which we may have overlooked if it wasn't for the amount of these issues. Having to resort to a basic french because the personnel of a grand hotel showed issues in speaking english is not what i would qualify as good service.  The hotel bans snacks and drinks not purchased at the bar including water and charges insane amounts (compared to the average costs) for basically everything. Water cost 3 dirhams (30 cents) in the nearby mall while they charge 40 for the same bottle.  Being checked and asked to open bags looking for drinks and food while entering the hotel and getting asked to leave the drinks bought at the nearby mall felt low-key humiliating.  The SPA is advertised as open 9-21 but nowhere is advertised that even the basic sauna is 300 dirhams (~30 dollars/euros) just for access.  On the other hand I would commend the Breakfast personnel for their great service and professionalism and i would recommend the hotel managers to review their policies.,Date of stay: September 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Basel, Switzerland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ale3712016

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Shirley A wrote a review Sep 2017,40,Best Kept Secret in Marrakech..,We chose this hotel for our 10th wedding anniversary and it didn't disappoint us.  We suggest that you make arrangement with hotel to have airport service...it made our entry into the city very smooth.  Once you enter the lobby you are immersed in stylish Moroccan decor. Our room was spacious with a wonderful walk-in shower. The housekeeping staff were warm and friendly.  The highlight of our stay was the breakfast and lunch service. They have the best ambassador for Morocco managing the food and beverage services by the name of Jawad. Each day he would greet you with such warmth that you are guaranteed to look forward to the rest of the day. The wide selection for breakfast is almost overwhelming there is so many options. His staff are the most professional and accommodating.We cannot speak highly enough about Jawad and his staff in making our stay perfect. This experience is worth booking here by itself.  In the afternoon you must stop by the lounge bar in the lobby. The bartender is the most delightful young lady who has the most infectious smile and demeanor. She makes you want to stay longer than you intended.  In the evenings they have a trio playing poolside with a singer who has the voice of a nightingale. You'll be entranced to sit and listen to this excellent band.  Room service is quick with reasonable pricing. The laundry and dry cleaning service is quick and reasonably priced. Poolside services are top notch as well. Best place to stay for your Moroccan experience.    About the only complaint we have is that we got all dressed up to go to their Touline restaurant to find out it is only open 3 days out of the week. They should post the limited hours so that the guest are aware of this.,Date of stay: September 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Sacramento, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/agmo59

The downside:: chaotic front desk and internet in the bedroom.  In general the staff were great and agreeable. We had a problem with the sink in our bathroom and this was dealt immediately after first mention. Shopping mall and restaurants next door are a bonus!

We got a suite with a view of the main pool modern updated well maintained room which was kept spotlessly clean.  Best pool  massive with music in the background all day pool staff a little slow but give them a tip and then very attentive.  There are other pools in the hotel too one indoor one with subtle lighting mind you  sauna and jacuzzi were an extra to use.Spa was lovely too.  We ate at Alfredo a resteraunt in the hotel fab Italian food but a little pricey for Moroccan standards.  Adjoining the Menara mall was an added bonus  as they have a food court upstairs handy for a quick bite for lunch and great area for kids to play too.  Lots of fairly decent places to eat within minutes away too with great ambience.  Check in was very slowand communication with staff a small problem they pretend to understand everything but never act on it.  Not quite a five star rating but very close.

Both pools were lovely and different the smaller pool was quiet and relaxing and the bigger main pool was more lively albeit still relaxing. Our room was top notch I requested a pool view deluxe king size and thats what we received. They even had their own hotel shuttle taxi's which was the icing on the cake for me. Even down to the smallest things like the maid's upon cleaning the room even folded my girlfriends PJ's each day. The only thing and I mean the only thing that I can fault is the daytime pool service was slow friendly and helpful but slow. However thats me being pedantic. Thank you Savoy!

Breakfast is served between 8-10 with moroccan delicacies crepes waffles and traditional breakfast foods although there was no cereal.    The pool area provides entertainment and there are two outside pools and one indoor pool.    We would recommend the Savoy as it is great for families and couples. The staff are friendly and welcoming although at times you need to ask more than once for something to be given or done.  Concierge was very helpful and the security guard was a lovely.

The staff start arguing that he is doing it with every single guests and its normal procedure. After he completed the check-in process he informed me that 1 room is not ready and we should wait for a while I couldn’t get the room until 17h15 we waited for more than 2 hours we called a guest relation manager and he tried to do some PR but he fail as well on delivering immediate solution he started justifying that the room is still not ready and in process of cleaning I couldn’t understand how come they are requesting guests to check-out at 12h00 and until 15h00 they couldn’t be ready to clean rooms.  When we reached the room after 2 mn walks we noticed that the TV remote control is not working and the safe is blocked. We called them to take action they solve the issue of Safe but took time to change the TV remote control the next day we had an issue with the bathroom door which has been locked and the door handle was broken fortunately no body was inside the bathroom we got the maintenance team around midnight to solve the issue.  Last but not the least on the last day at the time of check-out we faced again huge queues with very slow processing I spent more than 1 hour waiting my turn and at one stage I was obliged to call the Guest relation manager to help and proceed the cancellation of the credit card pre-approval my both rooms was already paid through travel agency and I had no extra to pay on the rooms. Imagine you have a flight to catch for sure with their slow processing you will miss your flight and nobody will care about the inconvenience caused.  Honestly it’s very bad experience and hotel can’t be 5 star ranked with this level of customer service and unprofessional attitude I was wondering if they will offer any commercial gesture for those many incident or at least an apologize letter but no action has been taken. I am not recommending this hotel as it’s not 5 star standard and not delivering high level service even management have no empowerment to solve the problems.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Addy B wrote a review Aug 2017,40,Great hotel for a first visit to Morocco!!,It was our first visit to Marrakech and even though we were excited there was a slight apprehension since we were visiting a completely different part of the world.    The Savoy Hotel is definitely an expat oasis. It has an excellent location and is a 15-20 minute taxi ride from all the major attractions. One of the most important things for us as a traveller is the food. Living at the Savoy you'll have plenty of options both inside and outside the Hotel. Within the Hotel they have an excellent breakfast. In the afternoons you can sit by their pool and order in or do sheesha in the courtyard by the pool. Their Italian restaurant offers decent pizza and pasta so you can never go wrong with that.    Adjoining the hotel is the Menara Mall which hotel guests can access through an entry from within the Hotel itself. Out on the main street there are a number of al fresco dining options. There is a lebanese restaurant just about 200 metres from the hotel however there is a fabulous one about 15 minutes ride away called Azar. It offers fine dining along with sheesha and I would highly recommend it.    If you like doing activities then just ask the Hotel Concierge and they will advise you on all the options and get it booked in for you. I would say this is the best option since it saves you the hassle of finding activity providers while giving you the peace of mind of booking through a trusted source.    We booked a quad biking activity which lasted around 3 hours. It happens about an hour outside of the city but was loads of fun so I highly recommend it. Their is hotel pick up and drop off so all you need to do is get ready and just go for it. I would also recommend doing a tour of the Atlas mountains which includes hiking up to the waterfalls. There are a total of 7 waterfalls so depending on how much time you have you might want to do just 2 of all of them. We did a half day trip of the Atlas mountains and could hike up to 2 of the waterfalls.    It was always great coming back to the hotel after taxing ourselves outside. The hotel provides you with a sense of calm. They have an excellent spa that includes in indoor pool and sauna. We tried both the hammam and the signature massages and werent disappointed by either.    My only reservation about the whole experience is the time spent in check-in. However thats a small minus compared to the overall experience.,Date of stay: December 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/801addyb
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Ridaa786 wrote a review Aug 2017,50,Fantastic hotel,Me and my husband stayed here for one night during our travels around Morocco. I was incredibly impressed. I have stayed in several 5* hotels to say the least and this definitely met the standards. The suite was a comfortable size and the facilities within the room were great. I am very particular about a clean bathroom and this met my high standards. The bed was comfortable and sheets clean. I'm the morning breakfast incorporated a large variety of choices with the staff ensuring tables were always clean and our orange juice glasses were topped up.  Only negative is the front desk staff who are slightly slow which means you end up waiting for a while before checking in and out (if you need to check out and get somewhere make sure your down in the lobby an hour in advance!). I don't think the staff are incompetent but it is a large hotel with tourists from all over and I think there were understanding/language barriers sometimes. Zahira served us at the front desk who was lovely and polite she made me and my husband feel very welcomed. The location of the hotel is ideal with lots of bars and restaurants at a walking distance. Most the sights are also a 5-10mins taxi journey away which was perfect as we had such little time in the city. The husband and I have already agreed that we will definitely be returning to the hotel and this time for longer to ensure we are able to make full use of all the facilities.,Date of stay: August 2017,,"Leicester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ridaa786
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Yash C wrote a review Aug 2017,50,Excellent service and Marrakesh tour package!!,We went for a family trip to Marrakesh and had a marvelous experience of the city and the Atlas Mountain. It was a short trip so we weren't sure how to schedule it to cover all major areas of the city. It was their guided tour that made this enjoyable and one to remember. They offered a two day tour package at a very reasonable price with great discounts!! The tour covered the city and the three valleys in the Atlas Mountain. We were given a private tour experience in an air-conditioned car. The guide was very friendly and gave us detailed explanations of the major highlights of the city along with ample time to roam around. Staff were very friendly and always gave their advice and help whether it was choosing a good Moroccan restaurant to eat or places to shop.    We would highly recommend others to stay at this hotel. Whether you are looking just to relax in the luxurious pools or travel in the city their services are impeccable and you will enjoy your experience of Marrakesh!,Date of stay: August 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/667yashc

Although the hotel has a good appearance and an ideal location the service is mediocre and the staff is incredibly incompetent and rude. We had a different issue every day (construction noise in our room keys not working waiting ages to get served at breakfast being late to the airport because the concierge took too long to bring our luggage down our room not being cleaned etc.). The staff is incredibly rude and treats customers like they don't matter certainly not like a 5* star hotel should treat them. Every time we went down to reception to complain there was at least a dozen of other people also complaining and angry. All employees are rude dumb arrogant and have no clue how to deliver good customer service. For the price paid there are much nicer hotels in Marrakech. Avoid this at all costs.,Date of stay: August 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U1272ENritas

Staff are super nice and helpful location is great just near night life and mall and supermarket.  The hotel has two pools the main big pool and another quite pool.  The hotel ground are so big and to my bad luck I got a room which is very far from lobby which is more than 5 minutes walking.  Breakfast is SUPERB and has a very big variety and the staff at the breakfast are so polite and helpful.  The only downsize is that you cannot enter any food or drinks with you.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,mbarrett2101 wrote a review Aug 2017,20,"Amazing Facilities, Shocking Service",The facilities in this hotel are great - the swimming pool is large and spacious there are even sunbeds built into the pool ensuring you don't get too hot when the 40 degree whether starts to take it's toll! The rooms are good quality and they are very clean. Breakfast is good too and with lots of choice. The hotel is connected to the Buddha Bar which serves amazing sushi great wine and great entertainment (would definitely recommend). In terms of facilities this is almost 5 star.    However the service that we received was far from what you would expect. We arrived at the hotel at midday. We had a guest relations manager who sat us down ensured us our room was almost ready and offered us some Moroccan Tea which was very nice. He set our expectations that we would be waiting for 20 minutes maximum. However an hour passed by and we were no closer to getting our room. I went up to the guest relations manager at 1pm to ask how much longer we would need to wait and he let us know that check in wasn't until 3pm. Whilst I appreciate check in is at 3 this was not the expectation that was set when he sat down and gave us tea and had I not gone up and asked he would happily have had us sit in the reception doing nothing for 3 hours. I had to ask to be directed to a hotel bar in the meantime which he happily did however he should have suggested that we go to the restaurant/bar at the start as this is a better experience. When we sat down for lunch it took over an hour to serve up 3 club sandwiches although there was only one other table to serve.    He also showed us that we were connected to a mall and that there was a supermarket we could use in there if we needed more food and water. However when we tried to bring water back into the hotel security refused this letting us know that bringing water from outside the hotel is against policy and we would not be allowed to take it in. Again a false expectation was set. I also did not find it fair that we could not take water in considering water is expensive in the hotel and if you asked for a large water it would often take over 30 minutes for them to bring it to you. I don't think it's a great experience for us to wait half an hour for a water in 40 degree heat and tell us that we can't buy water from outside to keep ourselves hydrated.    We had two double beds in our rooms and there were 3 of us staying in the room big enough for 4. However they only had 2 towels. When we called reception to ask for another towel they told us it would be up within a couple of minutes however we never received a towel. We would call again after 2 hours and be assured we would receive one and still we would not receive one. Only on our last night they did actually go through with their service and provide a towel but 5 hours later and we already had to share a towel at that point.    On some days we decided to explore Marrakech in the morning and come back to the pool in the afternoon. If we came to the pool in the morning great there is a towel laid out on each sunbed for you to use. However when you leave for the day there is no where to put your used towel so it stays on the sunbed for no one else to use. This meant that when we came in the afternoon there were never any clean towels. When we ask the pool staff for a towel they promise more would be cleaned and they would bring it to where we were sitting in 5 minutes. (You can't sit on the sunbeds without a towel as it is too hot so we would sit in the pool). 15 minutes later they were no closer to bringing us the towel so I went back to ask for an update. They tell me it would be another 10 minutes. 10 minutes later and still nothing. You often have to wait over an hour for a towel. Whilst the pool is absolutely amazing and everything you can ask for in a hotel pool the towel situation is quite frustrating as you would expect it to be better run. All this would take to fix is a towel process in place 1. If you leave the pool for the day put your towel in the towel bin. 2. Clean those towels. 3. When someone new comes have towels ready for them. This is a lot more proactive than reactive and does wonders for the customer experience.    Another thing we noted when we went for breakfast is someone would serve your table with coffee and orange juice. However they were all assigned particular tables and would not come to you if it was not their table (fair enough - but at least tell the person who's table it is that we are waiting). On our last morning we sat down for breakfast there was about 6 staff standing having a laugh some of them made eye contact with us but didn't come up to us nor did they notify the right person that we were there. It was early (we were frustrated anyway and this wasn't helping) and it took 10 minutes for our allocated waiter to come. All it would have taken is for one of the other waiters to come up and say that our allocated waiter would be right there.    Overall while the facilities were great the service was not up to par and caused more stress than it was worth. I really hope this review gets read and my suggestions are taken on board as these little things will make all the difference to the service of this hotel.,Date of stay: July 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Newbury, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mbarrett2101
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Michael H wrote a review Aug 2017,20,Let down by VERY poor service,Whilst the facilities are lovely (Great pool lovely rooms) and very clean the service in this hotel is some of the worst I've ever experienced. I travelled in a party of 3 which is less common but after the fourth consecutive day of asking for an extra towel mugs and ammenities it is very irritating. The towels often didn't come after asking which meant we had to keep persisting. When we arrived we had to wait for our room (understandable) but they didn't point us to the bar or restraunt we were just expected to sit and wait with no more information given.    The worst part was not being able to take WATER into the hotel. The cost of a bottle of water at the bar was extortionate and every time we took bottles in we were accosted by rude staff saying we couldn't bring any in. We had to argue a good 10 minutes each time. Which was appauling the tap water is undrinkable so it's a basic right to bring water inside.    If you go down to the pool after all the beach towels have been used we had to wait for an HOUR to get a fresh one. In the blazing sun it was really frustrating.    Some of the receptionists are lovely however others can be very rude and abrupt and speak down to you. When you're being spoken in such a rude way it can be incredibly off putting particularly if your French is not fluent (all staff are fluent in french).    I would also advise to be careful if your airport transfer is included in a deal. They charged us for the transfer back to the airport and said it was only one way (nowhere in the booking did it say that).    This is a very beautiful hotel but the service and staff really put a dampner on the entire holiday.,Date of stay: July 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O2640RSmichaelh

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,jonathan J wrote a review Jul 2017,20,"Poorly trained staff, especially front desk, ruin what could be good experience","We booked a tour in Morocco which included Marrakech. The agency booked us at this hotel. Mistake! Check-in very complicated. Took 40 minutes and required a manager to be involved. We were pre-booked and pre-paid. Should have been simple and easy. It wasn't. The guy checking us in was obviously poorly trained and not knowledgeable. We paid the price by standing at reception 40 minutes for a simple check-in.    We were there 3 nights. On one day they decided we did not need towels. Had to call but no towels came. Called twice. Finally got towels. Same for bed covers. Call: nothing. Call twice get them after 45 minutes.    They also decided at another point that one of those mini soaps was sufficient for bath and sink for two people. Had to call....etc..    The day we left we had an early departure so decided to check out evening before. Not possible. Had to come back in the morning. Went to check out in the morning. Same guy as for check in. Had us there 35 minutes. We had not charged anything to the room. But somehow was complicated. The guy had to call his manager after having us there 25 minutes making calls talking on his walkie-talkie etc.. without explaining what the problem was. Eventually came out that we have a charge of 4000 DH on our account even though everything was pre-paid. He eventually asked for help. ""Manager"" came. Says the employee was a beginner! If that's the case why not help him from the beginning rather than having us there waiting with the guy not knowing what he is doing.    Manager took another 10 minutes. Then gave me a luggage tag for the luggage that was already in the car along with my wife and kids who have been waiting over 30 minutes. Asked for receipt. No go. They do not give you a receipt showing your balance is paid. First hotel in the world that does not. Further explanation and request did not change that. And it is not a Morocco thing because we stayed at the Sofitel in Casablanca and they like any other hotel provide a receipt upon check out.    So now I leave with absolutely no proof that I settled my account. If they charge Visa (and given the incompetence and confusion I would not be surprised) I have no proof that I paid anything. I have to ask the agency in Morocco who paid for the hotel to give us some kind of receipt and this may not be so easy.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Michelle71 wrote a review Jul 2017,20,4* hotel 2* service,I plan to travel next Summer with a larger group where I won’t be coming is the Savoy with all the competition their customer service leaves a sour taste in your mouth.    Before arriving I got an email from Expedia telling me that as I had booked through them I had VIP check in and 15% off spa treatments.    VIP check is = check in was at about 2/3pm knowing my flight landed at 10am I had planned to spend the time around the pool and have some lunch maybe until the room is ready. However on arrival I was told by the receptionist that she would check with housekeeping if the room is ready I can wait in reception or at the pool come back in an hour. Decided to sit around the pool came back in an hour the same lady told me to come back in half an hour came back come back in 15 minutes the FORTH time I went back directly to the concierge and explained he gave the impression that this is common and they should always tell customers to come back at 3pm. He said he would have my keys on my fifth visit and to be fair he did.    My luggage was stored in reception near concierge in the corner no one watching it I took it with no questions asked or stopped by anyone just be mindful when leaving your luggage. I was shown to my room after going to guest relations as I didn’t have a clue where it was and there was no one around to show me.    Through that night the fire alarm went off intermittently at 2am for half an hour. I looked out in the corridor and nothing could be seen. I rang reception as you think it’s a fault they said they would send someone. At 2.30 it started non stop I rang reception again and asked “shall we leave” their response “I will send someone”. I went out to the balcony to look and see people outside and smoke and the smell of burning?!? I couldn’t believe it the place was on fire and he said “I will send someone” like there was a fault rather than a fire. I told my boyfriend to come to the balcony we looked and could see plenty of smoke but no fire anymore. After 15 minutes people were told to go back to their rooms. I was actually freaked out where I am from recently had a horrific fire where people were told ‘not to leave their homes’ with horrific results. The air con our room now longer worked and the room was too warm to fall back asleep that night.    The next day or during our stay the staff hotel or management did not even acknowledge the incident had happened not a note through the door or anything to acknowledge anything had happened. That most people had been kept awake for over an hour with no information? Surely a note through the door to apologise  yes it may not be their fault it was more likely a guests fault but it happened and effected a lot of people.    Spa – We booked this morning with a lady in the spa for 1pm we returned to change it with the same lady at 3pm. So she had seen our faces twice my partner has a very distinctive look which I didn’t see anywhere else during my stay.    We went to the pool. At 2.30 we came and the same lady was there and we said we were here for our appointment can we use the shower (other spas we have showered and used their robes).  No she told us go to the basement and use their showers by the basement pool (which is a sauna its so hot down there) ask them for a towel we were a bit confused and asked there are no showers in the spa she said no.    We then walked passed two bars the restaurant and down to the pool to use their shower and ask for towels. There was no soap no cream we had to go from the shower to the hand soap and back again I showered in my swimsuit and then had to walk back passed the bars the men in suits looking at us like what are we doing very embarrassing to the spa. I'm not happy that I was made to walk through the hotel in a towel. Nor did we feel properly washed and cleaned ready for a relaxing spa treatment we returned to the spa and sat in their reception area than shown to the spa changing room with a shower bathrobe soap cream. I could not believe it. I said to the lady why did she say there is no shower she said I didn't know you had a treatment I said your colleague who sent us away also had taken the reservations? And if she didn’t know why did she not ask?    I was embarrassed not relaxed and this is how I spent my massage I didn't even want it anymore.    To add insult to injury I emailed them to give them a chance to apologise or anything over the above no response over breakfast someone asked us if our stay was ok I told him about the check in and about the treatment by the spa reception he noted it all down sat at our table took our room number and with that information? He did absolutely nothing. Waste of my time. He was more in the lines of yeah reception are known to do that (second person who knows about the fiasco of check in but it carries on?) and I can’t do anything now but I’ve noted it. No actually all he did was intrude on my breakfast.    The first 48 hours I actually spent time seeing I I could rebook this for next summer with the extended family at the end of the above no chance! They didn’t acknowledge anything had happened with every opportunity I gave them. There is so much competition in Marrakech and I will take my business elsewhere.  The last time I was in Marrakesh I had to move rooms twice due to things breaking or going wrong in the hotel however I’ve not mentioned this as the other hotels handled it so well it was a non issue. This hotel hasn’t a clue.    Pros – The staff at the sunny bar are superb the porters superb they need to swap everyone at the front line of check in and reception with these people I left my luggage behind their bar rather then with anyone in reception on my last day.  The pools are wonderful the rooms are large and clean.    We ate most of our lunches around the pool and every time they were very nice  The location is perfect for the mall next door the top floor would be a child’s paradise numerous restaurants within walking distance.    This is our third trip to Marrakech so we didn’t plan on visiting any sites but just to enjoy the hotels facilities.    I think they need to employ some experienced front line staff with proper hotel experience I don’t care what the reception staff look like as long as they can smile and know their job. Although I don’t actually think they care.,Date of stay: July 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Michelle71

Hotel is next to the Menara Mall which has a great kids indoor playground and games facility. Also has a few restaurants (none are great but ok--avoid Nabab) a food court (didn't try any) shops (there's a good souvenir shop on the 2nd floor better than what you find at the Souks). It's also connected to Carrefour which makes it easy to do shop for daily necessities of a family with kids (milk etc.).    A few things that you should beware: The main problem with the hotel seems to be managing the staff. You gotta hold on to your wallet in the lobby as if you are at the souks! I asked one of the staff at the reception desk (Youness) to break a 100 derham and ended up returning 80 derhams. Most of the concierge staff (brown uniforms) will expect you to tip them for every single time they say hi to you! They overcharge everything (I'm sure some of them are good people but we just didn't have the luck to meet them!). In particular one of the brown uniform staff (Yassine) overcharged us for a city tour by at least 60o derhams. We had 3 adults and a 2-year old kid in the group and he charged us for 4 people. The next day while booking a tour with his boss we found out that little kids tour for free! He seemed to avoid us but finally we saw him a few minutes before checking out and when confronted he got really nervous (first denied then said he'll return the money presumably went to get our money and then disappeared!).    Bottom line try to deal with the manager and avoid the little guys.,Date of stay: July 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,Washington DC,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sepantha
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Lhebb20 wrote a review Jul 2017,50,Like a palace,First impressions walking in to the hotel.. just wow! It looks like a palace and it's hard to believe you get such a beautiful hotel for such a good price. Everything is immaculate and the staff never stop working to keep it so.  Room was lovely loved the rainfall shower and complimentary chocolates every evening is a nice touch :) 4 beautiful pools to choose from spa is blissful and well priced you never really need to the hotel but the location is also brilliant 30 dirhams in a taxi to the old town but also far away enough from the craziness.  The only difficulty is that you aren't allowed to take any food or drink in even a half drunk bottle of water which is annoying at times particularly in 40 degree heat. However this is more than made up for and the staff are so friendly welcoming and helpful they gave us great advice on Marrakech whenever we was heading out and are a real credit to the hotel.,Date of stay: July 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lhebb20
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,zakbux84 wrote a review Jul 2017,50,Excellent!,We stayed in Savoy Le Grand for ten nights from 08/07/17 till 19/07/17. We could not fault anything at all. From the desk staff to the cleaners the service was brilliant Mourad in particular was very kind and friendly. Just one thing regarding the policy of no food from outside of the hotel this can be difficult when you have young children who go to sleep early and the hotel room service is expensive (which is to be expected with any hotel). However this should not take away anything from this brilliant hotel and it's staff.,Date of stay: July 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Bolton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zakbux84
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Hawa N wrote a review Jul 2017,50,Best hotel in Morroco,I took my mom there for my birthday and it was the best moment of my life.    The hotel is amazing and the employees are all fantastic. When we first got to the hotel I had issues with my foreign Visa card but a beautiful and nice lady named Haouda took care of my mom and I.  We forgot about the Visa card issues.  I even had a surprise birthday cake in my room. I felt so special. At Savoy le Grand Hotel Marrakech guests are treated as the image of the hotel itself which is royalty.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Getaway721873 wrote a review Jul 2017,50,Mind blown professionalism,To start I would like to mention that I grew up in the hotel business both my parents managed for over 30 years. After a long trip from the U.S. I arrived to the hotel where I was greeted by the doorman with a welcome smile I was then escorted to the front desk where Ms. Rania greeted me by name and to my surprise my luxe room was upgraded to a gorgeous suite with a swimming pool view it took Ms. Rania literally 5 minutes to get me my keys and send me off to my suite during my entire stay EVERYONE treated me with high professionalism from the doorman to the night shift manager let's not forget the swimming pool stuff who changed your towel each time you got off the pool the breast buffet stuff who changed you plate and asked how the breakfast was and if they can do anything more. I won't submit my review without mentioning every single member of the stuff at the Buddha bar  thank you for making my stay memorable this has been a delightful 10 days of my life.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Alanna G wrote a review Jul 2017,50,Paradise!,I loved my time in Marrakech at the Savoy le Grand!    I was a solo traveller and the staff made me feel exceptionally welcome from the moment I met my airport transfer (a great inclusive service) . All of the staff were exceptional and no request was too much trouble . I asked for recommendations on where was best to find a driver to take me sightseeing - I found the crowds a little overwhelming in the markets to search for one myself - and the staff not only were able to recommend someone they organised the entire day for me which was wonderful. Be aware the cost of doing this is higher that finding your own driver however in my opinion it was worth the extra money.    The staff would always make sure if you were leaving the hotel that you had enough water to take with you . As a solo female the staff would also always be aware of my plans and movements without being intrusive . It really was the thoughtful small things with the staff here that made all the difference!    The grounds of the hotel were to die for - absolute paradise! I spent many hours in the hotel grounds - the only downside is that they did play some quite loud music which I personally found a little annoying however it did make for a nice vibe around the pool  especially if you were travelling in a group.    The rooms were clean and well appointed I was very fortunate to have a balcony with a great view. I also ate in both restaurants a number of times which was simple but good food.

But as soon as you get in the entrance and welcome is lovely. We were in an executive suite which was a really good size with good amenities. The hotel itself was not far from el fenna market about 10 mins cab. We preffered that as we didnt want to be amongst the craziness of a tourist market. There are a long row of restaurants and dessert places along side the shopping centre and also a few good restaurants in the hotel. Breakfast was also good.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Edina wrote a review Jul 2017,50,Bliss!,We booked this hotel online from Australia. We had a couple of days before our tour started and thought a few days here would be nice. It was superb! Beautiful main lobby and greeted with mint tea on our arrival. Taken to our room by the Manager Mourad which made us feel special. I cannot fault this hotel. The rooms are large and spacious and very clean. In fact the whole hotel is very clean and well maintained. The staff can't do enough for you and if you ask for anything it's never too much trouble. The fitness centre is great and the pool area is large and lovely. We had a dinner here the first night on arrival as we were tired from traveling all day at their Moroccan restaurant Maricane Taraquoine it was delicious to say the least. Breakfast was 1st class and again the staff couldn't do enough to serve you.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Eric J wrote a review Jul 2017,50,First Class,We arrived at this hotel not knowing what to expect. Our first impression was a good one although on reflection the website fails to live up to the beautiful decor and style this hotel exudes.    The moment my wife and I arrived we passed through some security and we were aided by some courteous staff who took care of our cases. We were then greeted by a professional receptionist who tried her best to accommodate our unexpected early arrival. We decided to upgrade our deluxe room to a suite and within an hour we were sitting in what seemed like a small house. Suite 1525 contains two balconies and a bathroom the size of a London hotel room.    There are many positives to this hotel. Top of the list is the friendliness and professionalism of their wonderful staff. My wife and I visit many lovely hotels and a good concierge team always plays its part in the success of our stays. I'm pleased to say the concierge staff at the Savoy Le Grand headed by the super-efficient Medhi Is absolutely first class. They rank as amongst the best we have encountered and their restaurant recommendations and overall level of care and advice was faultless.    Everyone at this hotel plays their part in providing excellent service. There are many names that ought to be mentioned but I failed to diligently log them. Ones we do remember include: Guest Relations Manager Mourad (who went out of his way to keep my party happy at breakfast) Rachid and Soufiane from concierge (perfect role models for this hotel) and Ridhuan and Hassan in Security (who always greeted us with a welcome smile).    The excellent housekeeping team always ensured we had a very clean room. On the rare occasion we encountered them they were very friendly.    As for the location we loved it. Taxis into the centre of things is only 30 dirhams. However I must warn future visitors to be wary of unscrupulous taxi drivers who like to take advantage of your lack of local knowledge. It's wise to negotiate the price before you enter the taxi.    One last tip - the adjacent restaurants are tourist traps. Use the hotel's knowledgable concierge to keep you on the right track.    So top marks for a hotel who put their guests first. We look forward to a return stay in the future.,Date of stay: July 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"East Kilbride, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ebjoseph
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Stuntsivt wrote a review Jul 2017,10,8 weeks of bad service that didn't get any better .,So I have recently returned from Morocco with a very large film crew filming Jack Ryan the new TV show.  We stayed at the Savoy for 8 weeks and on the whole the hotel is very nice rooms are comfortable pools are large but the Major let down is the food and the service.  Now I am not a new traveler to Morocco or other Arabic Nations but let me tell you the one thing that never fails to amaze me no matter how nice the staff smile they never come up with the goods.    Sat around the pool on a day off and you try to find a waiter for a drink  you can see them all chatting and they can see you but just choose to ignore you which is probably best because the drinks and food arrive so much faster when you get of you backside and go and order them at the bar yourself so you would think.  The food is very poor and even if you have the same dish three nights on a row  it will always be different.,Date of stay: May 2017,Trip type: Traveled on business,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stuntsivt
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Rod Munro M wrote a review Jul 2017,40,Great hotel with huge pool.,We stayed at The Savoy on 13th June 2017 for a week. Perhaps due to Ramadan it was quieter than it maybe is outside this period but that suited us.  It is not a 5 star but a very comfortable 4 star with a spacious reception - yes reception staff a bit disgruntled when spoken to!- huge and lovely pool with plentiful thick clean mattressed sunbeds.  Breakfast was vast and with great variety but exactly the same every morning - but being fair because of the large variety you could chop and change every day. The room was great ( we had pool view on ground floor) with very large comfortable bed. Staff were very good and polite. We didn't have to wait long for anything contrary to other reviews. The only staff who were a bit sour were those on reception. Room was cleaned every day however very strange that there was only one cup left in a double room (so bring you own cups!) and no milk (so bring your own 3 in 1 sachets!). No robes.  We did buy cokes and water from the carrefour next door and didn't experience difficulty bringing that into the hotel although for security bags would be looked into.  Walk into town was a straightforward 30 min stroll in the sunshine. Taxi 20 dirhams (less that £2). Taxi to Airport from rank outside was about 70 dirhams. Hotel allowed us an extra hour in our room on last days due to last flight. All in all a very comfortable hotel well maintained and cleaned....... It however could have been anywhere in the world as it somehow lacked the Moroccan feel. Would be go back - yes definitely.  Finally the staff comments weread about and were concerned about prior to booking were unfounded for us at least. Great staff who looked after us well and politely!

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Navi S wrote a review Jun 2017,50,Wonderful stay & excellent hospitality!!!,Travelled as a family with 2 children aged 3 and 5 months old. We had a truly enjoyable and yet unforgettable stay here. All the staff were amazing. They always greeted us with a smile and provided assistance whenever necessary. The grounds are always kept clean and well maintained.    Our room was lovely it was clean and always maintained well by housekeeping. All rooms have a minibar ironing board kettle & coffee machine safe and minibar useful for storing baby milk/ food/water. It had a lovely balcony view overlooking the children's pool. We were provided with a bottle of water as a welcome drink in the room.  The breakfast buffet had a wide variety to keep you full from made to order omelettes/pancakes to cheeses hams pastry dessert fruits. Their orange juice is so refreshing. The breakfast staff too were amazing. Again always greeting with a smile ensuring we were enjoying our breakfast. Raafat's kindness was truly admirable whenever our 3 year old started fussing/ playing up with breakfast he would respond gently to her and even a number of times encouraged her to eat without any fuss.  Savoy is situated in a great location. About 10 mins to the main square and in close proximity to all of Marrakech's main attractions. Taxi should be around 30-40 MAD. Some try to charge 50 but if you haggle and persist they eventually give in. Next to the hotel is a supermarket Carrefour. Has pretty much everything you need. We regularly bought water and food items and had no issues bringing it into the hotel.There is also a huge mall with designer retail shops as well as a kidszone covering 2 floors great for entertaining the little ones. Beside this are a number of restaurants.  Just outside the hotel are camels if you fancy having a quick ride around.  As we stayed for 10 nights we decided to upgrade to a suite. Truly perfect experience. It overlooked the main pool. Night entertainment wasn't a problem for our baby to sleep. The suite had a separate lounge to the bedroom separated by a sliding door. The bathroom has a rain shower and bath tub with in built jacuzzi. there are also 2 toilets. Additionally it had a walk in closet. The balcony was twice as large covering both the bedroom and lounge with sun loungers provided. The minibar was fully kitted and whenever housekeeping came they always provided water as welcome drinks. Again service by housekeeping was excellent. Whenever we needed extra towels or bedding changed at short notice they responded very quickly.  All the security staff were wonderful. Always helpful always smiling very polite and friendly. We never had any issues with anyone.  Overall we had a thoroughly enjoyable stay at Savoy. It provides a service that is truly outstanding and unforgettable. We would definitely return again.,Date of stay: June 2017,,United Kingdom,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/72navis

The highlight for me was the stunning pool one of the biggest I've ever seen at a hotel I great place to relax after a hot day exploring the city. It has some very nice bars and restaurants. Other reviews spoke of poor service we didn't find that to be the case we were there during Ramadan and as such it wasn't full so perhaps that helped we got a room upgrade which was nice. However catering around the pool was limited and towel distribution seemed reactive not pro-active. Our breakfast was included I would have to say it was one of the best hotel breakfast buffets I have ever come across and I have seen many. It has a good gym and a large and impressive in door pool and spa.

I stayed here for 7 weeks the employees are not professional at all. I spent my time waiting for them all the time when they came! Because sometimes you don't even get what you asked for.  Restaurants are super expensive (more than in France) and quality is awful they just serve unfrozen food. That's annoying when you paid 14€ your pizza (around 6/7 in the restaurants by the hotel). Plus you have to be very patient 40 min for a frozen pizza 50 min for a burger.  The rooms are ok nothing special. Fournitures may be very used the sink as well.  And you'll be a lucky one to have a full minibar.  By the way they forbid you to take any drinks or food in the building even water.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,SalimM wrote a review Jun 2017,40,Nice hotel let down by poor customer service,We were really looking forward to our stay at this hotel but must say it was disappointing. At check in we were allocated our room and escorted to our room. No one bothered to explain where the restaurants were where to go for breakfast or timings nothing about the pool and where to get towels. Pretty poor as this is basic stuff you get all over the world. Seemed like no one cared or the staff were too overworked to indulge.    Our room was spacious and clean. Here more problems right from the start. The coffee machine was not working and despite numerous calls to have it checked or fixed it took three days before this was done. Downright unacceptable. As if this was not frustrating enough getting fresh towels was an issue. Mostly towels were not replaced when room was cleaned as they ran out. It was not till late afternoon that towels were brought and you had to ring several times to ask.    To the pool area and more problems. Unless you get down bright and early there is no place to sit and even worse you will not get any towels. Deck chairs are reserved with towels and then the guests disappear leaving empty deck chairs. How ridiculous. Management need to seriously look at this and remedy it.    Breakfast in the main restaurant was a battle as the hotel was busy so it was always packed and finding a spot to sit was a challenge. With one guy running round dishing out Morrocan tea you would be lucky to get his attention. When you finally found a table the breakfast was good. But the service was terrible. Not enough staff for the number of people so staff were rushed off their feet and did not know how to cope. You had to feel sorry for them.    Checkout was a joke. Having told them in advance we want a late checkout and paid a charge we were continuously disturbed with knocks on the door or phone calls asking when we would leave. Seemed no one was talking to each other.    All in all too many niggly problems so next time we will try another hotel. Such a shame. They need to get their act together.    This review will be followed by a manager thanking me for my comments and probably offering to look into things but they do that for all comments anyway. And a message for him: We did complain to the customer services manager.,Date of stay: April 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SalimM

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Trixitravels wrote a review Jun 2017,50,"Perfectly located, luxury stay",I am so pleased with our stay in the Savoy. From check in to check out the staff are amazing and always on hand with a smile and advice on the local areas. The breakfast buffet is outstanding has you full until dinner time with a massive selection of hot and cold food fresh pancakes and waffles and every pastry you can imagine. We visited the spa on site and again it is beautiful and left us so rejuvenated after a Hammam and massage. I noticed they have a hair salon here too so handy for a quick blow dry etc. The hotel is ideally located in a very nice quiet area between the medina square and the new town so you pay approx £3-£4 for a taxi to either side. The hotel has its own restaurants (they were closed as it was Ramadan so we didn't get to eat here) and there are four more nice inexpensive restaurants next door in the pretty Menara Mall complex. There is a big supermarket just next to the hotel for things like water and snacks it was convenient. There are camel rides and horse drawn cart rides just outside the door too if you want a fun way to get around. The rooms and bathroom were clean and tidy with everything needed including a coffee machine and a stocked mini bar. I loved the walk in shower room also it was so spacious. We had lovely views at night over looking the second pool area. All in all we were impressed by the luxury and service we received at reasonable rates and I am confident we will return here in the future!,Date of stay: June 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trixitravels

So in a nutshell here's my review.  -Pros  Huge graduation pool  Huge bedroom and shower room  Rooms at spotless  Rooms have a ironing board and safe and tea/coffee/minibar/fridge  Good choice of breakfast  Great location  Hotel ground are very clean and tidy  Good choice of lunch  Has a poolside Dj playing Beyoncé Rihanna Sean Paul and chart hits  Very friendly staff Hasiba and Murad  Menara mall is next door so if you've left anything at home you can find it in the supermarket in the mall.    -Cons  On arrival my room wasn't ready and I had to wait over an hour and I wasn't offered a complimentary drink    There is no hair conditioner in the bathroom. Only a two in one which didn't nourish my hair    The hairdryer isn't that powerful (for long hair) so take your own.    I found the pool staff a bit chatty and not observant therefore missing my hand that I kept raising for my bill. Took 10mins.    Biggest downfall the tea and coffee and milk does not get replenished at all like most basic hotels do. I asked housekeeping for one more milk she said No.    -Overall  I would definitely stay here again.,Date of stay: March 2017,Trip type: Traveled solo,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MissVirdee

The two guys who served eggs and pancakes in the morning were awfully rude and unwelcoming every morning. Bar staff are slow and have a 'cant be bothered' attitude. Took over 10 minutes to bring a menu and 15 minutes after to bring 2 drinks. What a joke!  However i have never seen staff so attentive and working so hard until Mohamed El Ghazi (night manager) was on. I had received the best customer service when he was there. It was the best all holiday. Mohamed made sure our family were OK and got a good experience at the Savoy. More managers there need to have that attitude and the place would be much nicer.,Date of stay: May 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shermaine534

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Helena M wrote a review May 2017,10,The worst experience in a hotel ever in my life,눉  I've been with my daughter at Savoy Le Grand Hotel Marrakech from the past 14th till 17th of May.  I would like to explain with details what happened:  - As a genius client booking.com informed that I can make the check out later.  So in the morning of our depart before breakfast we went to the reception to check at what time we had to leave the room. We were informed we could leave at 2/ 3pm.  We went for a walk and when we return at 1:45pm we couldn't open the door of the bedroom with our key and we've to go again to the reception to ask for another one explaining that we were authorized to leave the room later.  We come back at 2:35pm and we ask at the concierge desk for a taxi to the airport and we sit on a sofa waiting for the taxi.  When it arrived I was asked for the checkout card. As I never heard about that I went to the reception to ask it.  There the attendant( the same woman that informed me in the morning that I could leave at 2/3pm) said that I had to have left the room at 2pm and as I didn't to receive the checkout card I had to pay 50% of the daily rate ( 1.000 Dhr). I explained the informations she had given before and then she turned her back on us and left the reception ( I thought she went to talk with someone who can solve this issue).  When she came back began to talk with other clients while we go on waiting.  Around 10 minutes later when I ask her what was happening she told me that she was not liar ( so the liars were we!) and that I could talk with her supervisor that was also in the reception.  That man explained me in the rudest way I can imagine that those were the rules of the hotel and I had to pay the 1.000 Dhr or we wouldn't leave the hotel!  I feel we were in a jail!  In practice it constituted a criminal act of abduction criminally punishable.  The point is not the payment. The problem was the attitude of the hotel employees who harassed clients very aggressively making them feel so uncomfortable. And I think also that it was a gender discrimination because I don't believe that the attitude were the same if the clients were men!  It is really deplorable that a prestigious hotel chain such Savoy give instructions to its employees to have this behavior. Arresting a customer in the hotel because they left the room half an hour later!!!

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Tony L wrote a review May 2017,50,Well done Le Grand Hotel!,What a wonderful hotel!! On arrival we were immediately upgraded for free to a pool view room with a double balcony. The hotel is quite new and I'm almost mint condition which is no surprise as the staff seem to being constantly cleaning and tidying! We met Mourad Client Relations Manager who gave us a massive smile and a personal tour! What a great guy! Check in was easy the staff were incredibly courteous the room was beautiful and the service impeccable.    The large pool area (there are three pools) is wonderfully maintained and clean with plenty of sun loungers for everyone although some are reserved particularly early so if you can be an early bird I'd suggest doing the same.    Breakfast was plentiful with so many variations to choose from. Freshly made omelettes and crepes to a full English! Even iced doughnuts! Everyone was so helpful at breakfast even at peak times and I can't say a bad word about them. We were looked after by Hamza and it was our pleasure!    Some very slight negatives are;    1. Eating and drinking at the hotel is expensive BUT mere metres from the hotel are a variety ad restaurants offering good food.    2. Check out is a bit of a pain so leave a bit of time set aside for this before leaving for the airport.    3. If you're an early to bed early to rise person be aware that they have live music most nights that can disturb the peace slightly if you're in bed early!    Overall it's definitely a great hotel and I'd love to stay there again!    As a footnote if you're using Menara Airport leave in PLENTY of time to get through. Whilst the airport is only a 5 minute taxi ride away the queues are unimaginable!    Queue to get in the airport through security scanners queue to get your boarding pass stamped (you still have to do this even if you've checked in online I'm afraid) queue to get through another officer who checks you've got your boarding pass stamped queue to airport security and more scanners queue for the gate queue for the plane all the while having to constantly show your documents to another officer or five!!    Enjoy Marrakech it's beautiful and slightly intimidating at times but a great experience and a real glimpse into Morrocan life even if it is slightly sanitised.,Date of stay: May 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V113LAtonyl
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Najwa S wrote a review May 2017,50,Great Hotel ... Friendly and very helpful Staff,My First visit to Marrakesh. I was attending a Conference at Savoy and had reserved there to be close to the event and it was a great decision. I loved everything about the hotel the friendliness of the staff the pools the food the cleanliness and the location.  I was at the hotel along with 2 of my friends and we had booked separate rooms. We asked if there was a triple room available so we could stay together but there were none. To our surprise we were treated extremely nice and were offered the fanciest suite they have instead. I don't normally prefer staying in fancy 5-star hotels but i definitely recommend Savoy the warmth and friendliness of the staff makes you feel very welcomed.,Date of stay: March 2017,Trip type: Traveled on business,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/712najwas
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,WanderlustJayne wrote a review May 2017,40,"Bad start, hotel redeemed itself.",I would never have stayed at this hotel had the problems I encountered have started outside the cancellation conditions but since they did I was reluctant to give them a penny without even staying.    Originally booked for 3 people but at the last minute due to a medical emergency my Mother couldn't come. Since she was paying for the hotel I called them up to pay over the phone since it was her card. I have never encountered such a palaver. Ordinarily you can call any hotel up and they are happy to take payment over the phone. My mother had given verbal permission and was sat next to me but alas it was not so easy.  Fast forward THREE days and email tennis forms to fill in (in French) ID being sent off photographs of the card's front and back and being passed to and from several departments I emailed them saying DO NOT TAKE PAYMENT WE WILL PAY IN CASH. Low and behold within about 10 minutes the hotel phoned me to say miraculously payment has been taken. So after 3 days of their 'email being down' (seriously?!) and being unable to process payment and A LOT of stress particularly due to the family emergency they were suddenly able to process it?! Left me very dubious about this hotel and not at all looking forward to our stay.    That said when we arrived Mourad greeted us with Moroccan mint tea and was friendly as was Noora their customer relations manager. Gave us a room with a big balcony.    The staff itself are very warm and friendly. I couldn't fault their service. One waiter in particular at the Bella Lounge served us Moroccan mint tea each evening with yummy sweet snacks. He was lovely. I've included a picture of him pouring our tea.    Breakfast is also great. You'd have to be very pedantic to fault it. Great selection of hot and cold sweet and savoury Moroccan and continental food and any drink you'd like. We opted for bowls of fruit and cappuccino and orange juice.    Rooms are clean. No gowns or slippers as advertised but I knew not to expect this having read other TripAdvisor reviews. For a 5 star hotel I would have expected a bath. I've stayed in lesser starred hotels with better bathroom facilities. Hairdryer isn't great. Bring your own if you have long thick hair. Only one cup for the coffee and tea making facilities?! So my friend and I had to take it in turns to use the cup! A bit silly! Our room was cleaned daily but on one day the housekeeping took our towels and didn't replace them! Luckily one of the other bedrooms was left open so I popped in and took their fresh towels. With no sign of the housekeeping what else was I to do? Nobody was using this room anyhow.    Hotel was quiet and consequently not all of the restaurants were open. We really wanted to eat in the Moroccan restaurant but it was closed so we ate next door in Buddha Bar and it was lovely. Great food lovely staff and a free belly dancing show. I'll put up another review of Buddha bar in a moment. Worth a try if you're at the Savoy le grand.    Location - I really enjoyed the location. Right next door to the mall and lots of coffee shops and restaurants and shops next door. The area could be anywhere in America though. So if you're wanting authentic Moroccan experience then don't stay in this area. It didn't bother me though. When we went to the souk and medina and jemaa el fna I was absolutely harassed and touched and didn't enjoy all the attention. So staying at Savoy le grand and in this area was much more my cup of tea. People left me be and didn't ogle. It did feel like the USA but I felt safer and wasn't harassed.    All in all I WOULD stay back here. I wasn't expecting it to be great due to the bad start and poor communication but the hotel did redeem itself. But by all means shop around for a hotel. If I went back to Marrakech I would possibly look at La Mamounia a bit more expensive but looks stunning. Or as I said would go back here. For sunbathing and the pool it's good.    Read all the good and bad reviews of this hotel because deciding to stay - it's a mixed bag. On the whole I enjoyed it in the end.,Date of stay: May 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Wallasey, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WanderlustJayne

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Lorraine D wrote a review May 2017,40,Very Nice Hotel,We spent three nights at Savoy Le Grand. The hotel is very smart with a beautifully decorated foyer and is situated in a great location. Approx. 25 mins walk to Medina and souks or quick 10 min. Taxi ride. There is a supermarket and mall next door if you need essentials as well as various cafes/ choices for eating. Our room was opposite Buddha bar so you could hear the music but that didn't bother us. Huge choices for breakfast and attentive staff. There were no slippers and robes but I expected that after reading other reviews. Rooms were cleaned daily with fresh towels. It was my partners birthday and they arranged a surprise cake for our room which was lovely. The only reason I haven't rated 5 is because we didn't really test service or make any requests as we were out most if the time. Check in/out was easy and quick. I would recommend this hotel if you want a bit of luxury at a reasonable price. We would definitely stay again.

Tip:  when you travel Morocco first thing you must know is every place that you will arrive some one will come to help you first they are very nice but there interance is to take you not to the place that you need they will take you to friends stores to buy and get the profit for them self.  you will find after that the same thing in half price or even more.  one example:  someone offer us his help to get to El Fna  he took us to his friend and offer us lamp in 2500 dirham when we said that it's very expensive he took us to another friend and offer the same lamp in 150 dirham finally we bought it at only 50 dirham!!!,Date of stay: April 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Tel Aviv, Israel",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/itzik_levy-il

Have to be honest  I've been checking reviews for a few months now & judging by the mixed reviews I have read I very nearly changed my booking ! Sooo glad I didn't . I'm aware everyone's experience is different but I genuinely can't fault it. If you want international hotel luxury then stay here . If you want traditional Moroccan then book a riad . Amazing breakfast  amazing service throughout  short cheap taxi ride away from old town where it's all happening ! Spotlessly clean & nothing too much trouble for all staff we encountered ! We had a suite over looking the pool which was fab but too big for just the two of us as another double bedroom not used but probably one of the most spacious rooms we have stayed in ! Would I recommend ? Absolutely ! Only slight grumble as per other reviews is check in & check out time ! Could be a lot quicker in my opinion although staff very helpful.. quite a queue when we checked out & only two receptionists when I saw five on other occasions when not busy .. could do better here I feel .. wouldn't put me off staying again though !,Date of stay: May 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,England,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheShoeman

The room service was quite food when food was ordered. The price for Hookah/sheesha is extortionate and flavour is mediocre. I would have been better off making it myself.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Qasim S wrote a review May 2017,40,Holidays with friends,Stayed 5 nights at this lovely hotel with great surroundings with Minara shopping mall attached to the hotel and many major clubs  bars restaurants also 2 minutes by walk.    Positive's    - two massive clean swimming pools  probably the best I've seen anywhere and really well maintained.  - The breakfast was the greatest with so much variety and probably the best service team I've ever seen really attentive caring chef's with positive attitudes and interacting with guests ( great leadership)👏🏼  - housekeeping team very polite and helpful cleaned our room daily with a high standard.  - Roomservice team very efficient and polite from the operator to the service team.  - concierge always helpful and polite and really take pride in there job.👏🏼  - check in was good the lady was polite and informative and did a really professional welcome.    Things to improve    - Have more towels at the swimming pool waited nearly 30 mins one day because they were getting some cleaned. ( can be frustrating)  - Housekeeping dumping dirty trays at the stairs going down from room 2219 just doesn't look great for a 5🌟 hotel  one day a tray was there for 6 hours.  - maintenance in the bedroom wasn't great seals to be changed around shower door water leaked grouting around the door coming off.  - Roks snack bar was shambles we placed a order for 3 people 2 pizza  1 burger.... honestly there was a total of 3 tables no pool guests due to heavy rain and honestly over 4 service staff and 3 chefs and they forgot to post our order what resulted us waiting for 1 hour 10 minutes.  We were sitting in front of the kitchen and I'm shocked no one noticed.  Girl was very apologetic but could be a bit more relaxed.  - The Moroccan restaurant at the back of the hotel next to small swimming pool ( starting with T ) was probably the most bad example of a restaurant in my entire experience of Marrakesh we eat on Sunday the 30th April.  We arrived at 19.45pm and the restaurant was empty we sat on a table what was wobbling up and down with damp wet napkin.  We then moved to another table  what had glitter on the chairs.  I ordered beef shanks and it arrived 10 mins after my friends meal because apparently it takes longer to cook( it was an excuse and he forgot to send my order) so I eat after my friends.  His English was not that good but very polite person ( maybe a trainee)  I asked for a beer he bought me my bill while I was eating.  Beef was tough due to not being cooked for longer extremely salty.  Got the bill and we got charged over 40 Dirhams by mistake what they changed later.  Over all an awful experience on our last night.  - checkout was terrible  no good morning how was your stay no interaction..... A really bad lasting impression of your hotel.  except for your concierge team who  Really made a effort to say goodbye👍,Date of stay: April 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/992qasims
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Tour10554 wrote a review May 2017,40,Great stay,Stayed over Easter for a week. Wanted a relaxing holiday so chose this hotel so I could relax by the pool. But still very close to the city so easy to pop in to explore.  Room was large with very comfortable beds and large bathroom. I didn't notice any noise from neighbouring rooms.  Breakfast was ok. I guess it is personal but I never really found anything I particularly fancied except the fresh orange juice which was amazing. Drinks and food during the day were good but expensive I felt. So had to smuggle in from the supermarket next door and feel like a criminal in the process. The concierge did a great job of booking all my restaurants and even gave a good recommendation.  Gym fairly well equipped for a hotel but way too hot to stay in for long whereas air con in rest of the hotel worked well.  A good base to explore the old city to the east and the new city to the north (5-10 mins in a taxi),Date of stay: April 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tour10554
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,AHR_22 wrote a review May 2017,30,Not a 5*,It is important to manage your expectations well when traveling to one of these resorts.    We had a really lovely stay with the entire family. However this is not a 5* hotel at all. The entire complex looks tired although still nice. Main problem is service: you cannot get towels at the pool food was just ok and took forever and staff would not do anything proactively to elevate your stay at all.    Room are nice though.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Travelbuff wrote a review Apr 2017,40,Has everything you need,It's a very big hotel lots of rooms people...busy place! If quiet and peacefulness is what you want this is not the hotel for you. Although my room was very quiet I didn't face the pool areas and I was in the back building. Rooms very comfortable nice sized and good amenities. The hotel had everything you needed. A bar several restaurants fitness room spa multiple pools etc. Even the breakfast was good for it had options for all nationalities and nice selection of food.    I used the fitness facilities each day. One of the better hotel fitness areas. Nice weight machines and cardio options for when you're away from home.    The location is excellent. You can walk to everything. I even walked from the Medina which took me about 20-25 minutes. There is a market right next door to hotel which has groceries and drug store items which came in very handy and I saw a lot of hotel guests in there! There are many restaurant options nearby too.    Full facility hotel. I would definitely recommend. It was very clean. I didn't use the pool areas but that seemed very popular especially with the kids.    Personalized service and customer service is not at a high level. There are just too many guests to give that kind of service to.

We asked for tea and the waitress said she will be with us shortly but we never saw her again that morning. 2 robes and 2 pairs of sleeper between 4 of us that only after having requested them time and time again.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,SukkyJ wrote a review Apr 2017,30,Don't expect a 5* hotel for service because you won't!,Nice hotel in terms of premises and rooms but:  - You won't get the robes and slippers that are promised for every room unless you ask 10 times  - Not enough towels provided for the number of guests and if you request them they won't bring them.  - Tea/coffee facilities in room but they will only give you 1 teabag 1 milk and 1 mug even if you have a family room with 3 people! Instead you will be asked to order from room service!  - Maids will make up your bed but not clean your room/floors/balcony/bathroom at any time during a full week.  - If the restaurant sends out the wrong meal or your food cold - they will still charge you and expect you to pay the full bill.  - Expect to take 30 minutes to check-in. No preparation is done and the staff are very slow.  - The only hotel in the world that charges you for an extra teabag - just for liking a strong pot of tea!  - Staff are generally rude and impolite - apart from Maurad who is very polite and helpful but he still can't/won't do anything for you.  - When you check out you need a slip to leave the hotel but the staff didn't provide this to us so they were telling us we couldn't leave!!!  - If you like tea at breakfast - expect to ask for a pot at least 4 times before you get it. There seems to be a shortage of cutlery in the hotel too.  Overall a hotel that seems to rely on a few celeb connections (we saw Ronaldo and his family at the hotel) and give all of their attention to these more high value customers.,Date of stay: April 2017,,"Wakefield, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SukkyJ

The room was nice and comfortable but nothing special was arranged for us as honeymooners. 5* hotel should have done it as we mentioned that we are on honeymoon already on the booking. The check in process at the hotel was super slow and we waited almost 30min. The service at the Pool Area was poor too se waited and waited for drinks / someone to bring us towels.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Ortlieb wrote a review Apr 2017,10,Racist hotel,I stayed at this hotel which enjoyed a lot BEFORE this last weekend and it was a disaster indeed. The night people at this hotel are racists and are simply not capable of looking after guests.    I have family friends in Morrocco hence I visit a bit and had one member staying with me in my sweet registered and all and upon his departure without me as I already left he was treated like a prostitute because he is a young Marroccon coming from a good family from Rabat. These people are outright rude presumptious and have not guest services in mind.    Never ever will I stay here again this behaviour will at one point bite Marrocco in the butt and I hope it does.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Chris K wrote a review Apr 2017,50,Fantastic hotel 5* service at 3* price,I've visited Marrakech several times and always stayed in the Medina and loved being in the middle of the hubbub. This time i was travelling with my 11 year old and knew we'd need breaks from the madness that is Marrakech from time to time.  This hotel provide a perfect oasis and although it ws full it never felt over busy.  I was amazed at the quality of the hotel for the price.  The pools were perfect the food great for a fussy child (international style rather than Moroccan) and the service and cleanliness spot on.  This is not the place to come for a true taste of Marrakech but it is only a 30 min walk to the Medina or 30DH taxi.  For clubbers its next door to the Buddha Bar not that you can hear it.  All in all highly recommended for anyone travelling to Marrakech that wants a retreat from the Medina.,Date of stay: April 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Bristol, England, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChrisK272
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,486217 wrote a review Apr 2017,50,Everything and more that you could wish for.,My friend and I booked this hotel at the end of march beginning of April for five nights. We had initially booked a double room but upon checkin we were surprised and upgraded to a suite for free for the duration of the stay. Absolutely thrilled as the suite was gorgeous with a jacuzzi living room spacious bathroom 2 balconies and huge bedroom. Thank you  Breakfast is lovely a variety of items to chose from cereal tons of different pastries and got cooked foods pancakes crepes fruits omelettes juices really really nice and fresh. Service was great and everyone was friendly attentive and helpful.  The pools and hotel surroundings are breathtaking beautiful. Clean pools waterfalls lovely atmosphere throughout the day and evening with the different restaurants and bars on site.  Concierge staff and welcome staff absolute stars especially Murad Khadijah and Mohamed. They went above and beyond to make our stay enjoyable and memorable from recommending dining spots and advice which came in great hand when dealing with taxis. The hotel is clean and constantly smells beautiful.  The location of the hotel is about 10 mins from the airport and central to many of the main tourist areas such as the souks the city centre YSL garden and Medina. The main mosque is at walking distance as is the Menara Jardin. Menara Mall is connected to the hotel as is Buddha Bar W Club and a lot of fab dining places and a fountain display which is a great to watch as the water dances to the music.  I would definitely recommend Savoy Le Grand to anyone to stay whilst in Marrakech for the easy of how close everything is and the service we received. Can't wait to come back.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Minky09 wrote a review Apr 2017,10,Not sure if we where prisoners or hotel guests?,We have just returned from Marrakech with another couple after a five day break. I have outlined the issues below and hope that I don't receive the automated ignorant response from the hotel manager:-    1 check in is diabolical. It is slow and they are unhelpful and rude and explain nothing about the hotel's facilities. Even more annoying though was how they let other people they know push in and get checked in ahead of other 'guests'. Also on a minor point the hotel lobby has an overpowering floral smell that hits the back of your throat. The staff particularly the women are arrogant and rude.    2 Our room had not been finished when we arrived as we had nothing in the mini bar and no robes or slippers. It took until the last day of my holiday to get the bath robes. The room was very comfortable as clean and the maids cleaned the room well. They were super friendly every day...the only ones.    3 Service is agonisingly slow. You can never get anyone's attention and when you do they wander off to do something else.    4 The large pool is crowded and very loud and people reserve sun loungers from very early. The attendants are not happy to get any additional beds or move any around but are happy to do it for their VIPS. On the plus side the smaller pool is much quieter but the towels are not put out first thing so you have to wait. The waiter took a while to warm up but was quite friendly. He did though run out of rose wine and Fanta? He couldn't be bothered to get it from the main bar!    5 Occasionally we ordered drinks from the main bar by the large swimming pool. Rather randomly we would often receive the bill without the wine we had drunk on it. We would then be asked to pay cash for the wine?!!! They obviously wanted to pocket the money for the glasses of wine?!    6 Security is good. Perhaps too good as you are not allowed to bring drinks or food into the hotel that have not been bought there? Have you ever been to a hotel where you are not allowed to bring water or something to eat? Happy to report you can get round that one though by taking it through the mall side door entrance.    7 Breakfast was good. There was a great variety with better than the usual diabolical service. Handy tip though look away when the pancake man is making your pancakes...he uses his fingers to flip them. In fact the staff also used their fingers to replenish the pastries.    8 The front of the hotel is always.congested with locals and their big cars. It makes it very difficult for taxis to drop you off. In fact on one evening the hotel car attendant told our taxi driver off for trying to drop us at the front because of all the parked cars.    9 Don't bother calling room service front desk or house keeping. They never answer the phone and on the rare occasion they do they pretend to help you and then the promise never materialises.    10 Checking out! We checked out the night before as you have to queue for ages. We were presented with a bill of £500 as we had been charged the daily bed and breakfast rate despite having already paid Expedia. When we queried it the man that had presented us with the bill went away and a new man appeared. He was sarcastic and rude not apologetic but he did redo the bill.    11 We decided to confirm our check out on the day of departure and queued behind another couple with their young daughter who had had an awful experience. The father was very upset and the hotel were so rude with one of the managers trying to tel us that this man was awful and complained about other hotels. He said his daughter had been sickinnthe night and housekeeping would not change the bed linen......    12 Marrakech is quite beautiful but this hotel is not. We have stayed in the meridian over the road from this hotel before and although the rooms are a little tired the ambience is much more Moroccan and authentic and not vulgar and arrogant like this hotel. Staff at the Meridian are friendlier and more helpful.,Date of stay: April 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Minky09

Although i was upgraded to a suite there was work going on which no one seemed to know about so no sleep on the first night!    However once the morning came we had a great breakfast great service and were able to relax by the pool content. My one year old son loved it.    All our troubles were sorted by a sweet talking del boy like yet very personable and customer centric helper called Murad! Checked in with us daily and helped us with the room and most importantly a late check out on the house due to a changed flight! When he wasn't there his colleague named Sara was on hand to help us too she was just as helpful.    The hotel itself is great nice breakfast nice pool and lobby area to chill great location with the mall and restaurants outside. Only 5-10 mins taxi to the square or other areas. Family have to pay 20 but you can pay 6 only if your happy to share with others! Great people too got a free ride on a scooter to Friday prayers by some random guy!    So overall a great experience at this hotel a big recommend from a previously nervous parent!

On arrival we were greeted and introduced to the customer guest relation supervisor Mourad.  Mourad is one of the funniest guest relation I have ever met and so genuine.  Mourad reserved us a table at Buddha Bar next to the hotel for me and my 7 friends on our first night after he found out it was my friends birthday and arranged candles and sparklers in his desert he then arranged a cake to be sent to the room the following day and was just on hand to always have a laugh and joke with and also gives great advice and recommendations on where to go out in the evening.  This hotel is so peaceful and relaxing breakfast was great with loads of choice staff are really friendly and attentive.  Room service was really good and came literally 5-10mins after u call for anything extra for the room.  Shopping mall next to hotel and loads of restaurants around for a quick snack or desert.  Madina is walking distance about 30mins away and nice walks to have around the hotel.  Would definitely come back to this hotel and would say without a doubt Mourad made our trip that much more enjoyable he added his touch and made our holiday at the hotel amazing.

I've stayed in Rotana and Sofitel in Dubai which are PROPER 5 stars. No bath robes. Twice staff members knocked and before I answered they let themselves in to our room. My room was close to the lifts and you could hear the lift going up and down every second. I asked for a pray mat (Muscat - musala) on 2 or 3 separate occasions and staff members started panicking so I decided not to bother with them instead prayed on a clean scarf.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,MrsGolding wrote a review Mar 2017,50,Fantastic!!!!,I decided to do something different for my birthday celebration and Marrakech had always been on my travel bucket list. So off to Morocco for a wonderful girls trip!! Savoy Le Grand was absolutely superb when we first got there after an absolutely long and exhausting flight we were greeted by hotel staff who worked to coordinate check in of which included traditional Moroccan mint tea and suggestions for dinner at a popular off site restaurant. They booked us all in rooms very close to each other which for a group was highly appreciated. Bravo to our guest services and concierge staff that pretty much accommodated to our every beck and call . And with five women there were a lot of them. I got an unexpected surprise to my room birthday cake!!! with sparklers and all. Not to mention the red roses and turn down service with rose petals on the bed. We were able to book excursions with concierge but word to the wise when you see the word included its not part of the overall cost of the excursion there is the option at the additional cost. (Like lunch included however you pay 180 Dirhams as part of the tour for lunch) My group was obsessed with the vegetable pizza on the restaurants menu (they ate it four of our five days there). But the onsite restaurants were great we had Italian the daily breakfast bar and the poolside restaurant. At night we would hang out at Bella where the service was amazing. Forgive me for not including names! We were even able to secure henna by the pool as opposed to going to a henna café and it cost us way more minimal amount. Please go to Buddha Bar right next to the hotel the stage performance was great but I've had much better sushi. I could ramble on and on about the experience! Everything was perfect I would beyond recommend this hotel the staff the food the people it was all magnificent. Thank You Savoy for a phenomenal birthday!!,Date of stay: March 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Charlotte, North Carolina",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrsGold87

Check in was quick and easy.  Offered some lovely Moroccan tea whilst filling out some paperwork.  Staff are very helpful and concierge are very knowledgable with booking nights out / excursions etc.  Would be good if the hotel can ensure the taxi drivers outside have a fixed fair to specific locations as they try ripping u off!

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Steph93047 wrote a review Mar 2017,50,Perfect 5 day getaway,Highly recommend this hotel.    The staff were extremely accommodating to all our needs polite helpful and friendly.    Rooms were a clean and airy bathroom was huge (had a sit down shower).    Food was delicious breakfast every morning had an eclectic range of cuisines.    Swimming pool was nice unfortunately the weather wasn't great when we were there so only used the inside pool. It did the job however it was quite dingy.    The location was perfect for our needs a walkable distance from the medina and a supermarket shopping mall foreign exchange and strip of bars and restaurants on our doorstep.    Concierge were extremely helpful in booking us restaurants taxis and day excursions for a decent price.    My only critique is that I tried to email the hotel through with a request for a specific room in advance and they never got back to me.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Makstar123 wrote a review Mar 2017,30,Decent.,My husband and I just got back from staying at this hotel for 4 nights on Wednesday.    The pros: clean good location and perfect if you just want to chill at the pool and not leave the hotel. The hotel has access to the Menara Mall and Carrefour is right next door which was brilliant (especially if you have kids). There is also a dancing fountain just outside which is lovely to view at night. The mall has a variety of food places and the rooftop dining at the mall nearby was a great with a variety of options for food. Mourad (the guest relations guy) was big on recommending the Buddha Bar but unfortunately we weren't won over by the options so gave it a miss. Speaking of Mourad - he was very friendly approachable and having read loads about him on Trip advisor reviews I was really expecting a wow factor. But he didn't live up to it for me (personally). He was trying too hard to 'act' British because he had lived in the U.K. for a short period of his life but he would've been better being himself and sticking to his roots. His mimicking passing guests and mocking them for their clothing was disrespectful and some may find this offensive. On a slightly positive note the Hammam at the spa was nice and the back massage was very relaxing. Prices were very reasonable and easy to book.    Cons: When we arrived our room was not ready the receptionists could hardly speak a word of English and came across extremely ignorant. Liaising with one another in Arabic/French we were completely unknown to what was going on! My husband mentioned it was our first wedding anniversary - no acknowledgement no happy wishes and it was like she didn't know what he was on about!    The first room that we were given was in a rubbish location and had a view of only palm trees in our face - so we got him (Mourad) to change it with immediate effect. Whilst this was getting sorted we weren't given anywhere to freshen up or sort ourselves out and were just told to wait outside by the pool area. (Nice!) By the evening we had a 'Happy Birthday' macaron cake left in our room - clearly attention to detail is their thing - (or not!) When my husband complained that they had got it wrong the same cake stayed in our room for a further two days no changes made and nothing new to replace it. They didn't make the stay feel special at all and in fact it felt as though any requests made were completely disregarded. When we requested water bottles (complementary from the hotel) and replacement coffee cartridges they took almost an hour (or more sometimes) to deliver them to our room. There were no facilities for tea in the room (only coffee). The tables on the room collected dust for days but the cleaners didn't bother to wipe the towels were fraying and had to request for slippers and a robe (not readily available).    Breakfast options were OKAY there were no baked beans (they didn't know what I was on about when I asked for some) and it seemed very rushed after 10am. Everyday that I was there a different piece of the crockery was chipped and it just screamed health and safety to me. Chipped teapots and drinking cups and the plates sometimes had cracks on the edges. Again no attention to detail!    All in all I wouldn't give the Savoy 5 stars due to the lack of attention to detail and service. They really need to up their game in order to be competitive and maintain the level of standards that they 'claim' to have. It's okay to stay if you want somewhere with a good location and close to amenities (no headache).,Date of stay: March 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Leicester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Makstar123

I was very pleased with Sarah she made us feel very welcomed and comfortable and Khadija was super nice and helpful at Reception and Mohamed was very lovely and quick at breakfast. They were all very good to us throughout our 6 days in the hotel. The breakfast was very nice the pool and the hotel in general are very clean and tidy. The bed was very comfortable and we loved the pool view. Location is great and the Room service was brilliant and very quick. Overall it was a lovely holiday and I think I will go back to Savoy... :-)    - Unfortunately it wasn't perfect as I was expecting it to be from a 5* hotel like Savoy. They were really understaffed at breakfast. I was asking for a glass of water and a tea spoon every day and I never got them until the last day. :-) The general Reception staff were very slow and easily overwhelmed with people I had to wait endlessly all the time. The room was a bit stinky and it was a non-smoking room btw! The WiFi was very temperamental. I wanted to use the sauna for 15 minutes and they said it's 200 MAD (£16.00) for one hour including the tiny Jacuzzi and nobody was in the spa at all. It should be free or give us a day pass at least for that amount of money very disappointing.,Date of stay: March 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/laszlo0916

I didn't want to take the cab. Going to medina 10-15 walked- it all depends if you have luggage or if you like walking so the time is insignificant but enough for guidance. Hotel I recommend for business or family or couple- I was a solo traveler. Be warned the hotel doesn't allow you to buy food or drink from outside. Mind you I bought 6pack of 1.5 liter of water doorman have to assist or bring it to my room since security stop me?  Grocery and mall next door convenience!

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Mags_Frankie wrote a review Mar 2017,30,Good hotel but not 5*,"At first it's a lovely hotel.  We stayed in Savoy in the Egypt and that was definitely a 5* hotel.  The Savoy le Grand Hotel Marrakesh isn't 5* it's more like 4*.  They love their reviews so they will make sure you are happy but mistakes shouldn't happen in first place when it comes to Savoy.  The pool outside and inside are great. Very clean.  People as everywhere leave their towels on the beds to reserve the"" good spot"" however you can easily remove the towels as there is not policy to keep the beds unattended. Which is great as some people leave their stuff on beds for 3 hours while they are gone to eat the lunch..unbelievable and selfish!  The highlight of that hotel is the location and the Buddha Bar next door! Amazing atmosphere and service!  The staff Murad is really good he will make sure you have been looked after. It was our wedding anniversary so we got a cake surprise in the evening of our arrival.  The Gym is very good however the air conditioning isn't great so it's like working out at the sauna!  The Spa: well where to start... we have booked a 50 minute massage and sauna for my husband. You pay £20 for sauna/hour took 25 minutes to get the sauna hot because the staff was in and out there was no water so he had to keep asking for it.  Massage was ok but they were running late so they did only 35 minutes instead of 50 minutes.When we complained the manager was arguing with us likely the region director of Savoy walked in and said that we must have great experience so they gave us 30 minutes massage for free which was great and very appreciate as the girls were amazing! But we had a bad experience at first so that wasn't great.  Breakfast is good so much choice. However the seats inside are very dirty- food cramps and hair!  Food is very expensive! When you ask for the bill it take ages or they will forget about you. Someone broke the glass took them 15 minutes to com end clean everything up.Just outside the hotel there is a small restaurants with better prices but the same choice of foods.Some of the restaurants don't have English speaking waiters nor menus.

The concierge service was an horrible experience. abdillah the concierge is very rude and not helpful at all. Jamal was very nice and helpful on the other hand. He should be the head concierge. The hotel told us that the trip to the airport will cost 70 DHS but when we got to the airport the driver asked for 100 DHS. It's all quite confusing. It was convenient to go and eat at menara mall. When we ordered room service it was a mess. The lady who is in charge of room service was very rude on the phone. Some staff are nice but some rude and they are not really fluent in English. Breakfast was good but could have got better fruit selection. If I would go to Marrakech again I wouldn't go to this hotel. I was very disappointed as it's not as the same standard as a Savoy hotel in London. It's just an average hotel. I told Sara the guest relation advisor at the hotel about the concierge behaviour. She apologised but she didn't do anything to make our stay better. She was nice but she didn't go out of her way to do something about this. This was disappointing. I have stayed in so many hotels and when something goes wrong they do everything they can to make the stat better so that they don't get bad reviews but the management of the hotel didn't care.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Colin P wrote a review Mar 2017,50,"Relaxed atmosphere, pleasant experience",This is my 6th visit to Marrakech Morocco. I've stayed in all kinds of hotels riads and villas. I can say this place is top notch. I stayed here with my wife and our experience was very pleasant throughout. I will be coming here to stay from now on.    Accommodations: From the second you walk in you're getting a truly luxury Moroccan experience. You walk in from the hot sun to a stunningly beautiful and cool entrance I still remember the smell of orange blossom.    The staff is super helpful and accommodating! I really felt like I didn't have to worry about a thing and that I was being taken care. From A to Z the attention to detail is evident. I'd especially like to thank Amine Lamnyi for going above and beyond to give us the best experience as possible!    The lounge is great to just sit and relax to while enjoying complimentary Moroccan tea and live music (also really good quality italian coffee ;)    The rooms were awesome! Spacious and clean with great views. I could not ask for anything better.    The pool area is probably my favorite - a huge beautiful pool with a waterfall and super comfy chairs. The food and smoothies are delicious. Perfect place to just relax and unwind. The ballroom/restaurant area next to the pool is quite stunning.    Location: Savoy Hotel is in the perfect location - sitting right outside all the hectic areas giving you a bit more quiet and relaxed atmosphere but still 5 minutes from everything. It's close to many resorts the airport shopping Buddha Bar restaurant and minutes away from all the wonderful Marrakech tourist destinations (Jemal Fna square the artisan souks Menara etc).

Once again like to say thank you Mr Mourad 😳  The rooms where excellent clean big beds and cleaning staff where great also we had down breakfast only which was amazing overall I give this hotel 5/5 👍🏽 and would recommend for a nice getaway for a few.

We did not have time to make the most of the hotel facilities but they seemed quite wonderful. The staff were friendly polite and helpful.    The hotel is well located right next door to a mall where there is a Carrefour supermarket. We were able to walk into the Medina in about 20 minutes along beautiful tree lined roads. What a contrast between the modern hotel and the ancient city!    One or two quibbles. We visited at the start of March so the season had not got underway. However where we were in the Moon wing the sound from outside on the corridor was evident sometimes which I would not expect of an upmarket hotel.

No robe or slippers and air conditioning was set to hot which hotel would not change. Even though it was 32 degree weather. Strange.  Breakfast is superb possibly one of the most extensive I have ever seen and is probably the highlight of the stay.  Pool area is good pool itself is freezing I guess in summer the pool temperature will increase but for spring it's really cold!  Service at the pool is a little hit and miss waiters forgot to bring our drinks and got the salad order wrong. Not major issues but in the long run its the small attention to detail that differentiates a 5 star from a 4.  Location to Buddha Bar next door is handy we ate a fantastic meal there.  All in all this hotel is good. They just need to pay closer attention to small details.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,umera a wrote a review Mar 2017,50,Amazing,We stayed here on the second half of our holiday and my husband and I were just taken aback by the tremendous service. On Arrival we had a tour by the lovely Guest Relations Agent Sara she was amazing at explaining everything and giving us ideas about where to try out in the evenings. My husband and I found her very professional and what was extra nice was that she gave us every reassurance that if we needed anything that she would help us. Another member of staff that we liked was Zineb who was also very lovely. Our new friend Mourad the Guest Relations Manager was very helpful and very active throughout the hotel. You would often find him walking round the hotel just to check on the guests and always made sure they were happy. For those of you who are considering this hotel should simply know that this place has everything. You have the hotel facilities spa and gym as well as the most amazing breakfast ever! The restaurants within the hotel are lovely too. You will have access into the Menara Mall from Within the hotel and for families there is a huge Kidz Zone which looks like a lot of fun for the little ones. At the front of the hotel you have a variety of choice for restaurants. You can grab a bite at lunch sit back and enjoy the atmosphere under umbrella tables or you can have a romantic dinner and enjoy the dancing fountains which look stunning. Right next to the hotel there is a Carrefour Supermarket which is great for last minute items especially if you need toiletries nappies or just snacks for your day to day exploring. If you want quality service away from the hustle and bustle or want to mix it up after staying in the centre I would definitely book here. You will not be disappointed and my husband and I cannot wait to come back to for the third time.

We were greeted by a lady called Sarah who was very friendly and told us to sit down and she would organise check in. After half an hour we asked for an up date and were told it would be a few minutes to organise keys. Eventually we went up to the desk and checked in ourselves. Nothing had been done for our check in but we were promptly checked in at reception.    On checkout it was a very slow service and took 20 minutes although the receptionist was friendly. I had put a card down on arrival for one room as security for one room. I paid for one room on check out.    On arrival home I checked my bank account. I have been charged for one room AND the total for BOTH rooms!    I have email them and hope it gets sorted out promptly.,Date of stay: March 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joannemccarthy1986

As we walked into the hotel we were greeted by Mourad who instantly ushered us to a couch where we were served tea while he checked us in.    The room was gorgeous and very comfy. It was clean and spacious. The concierge was very helpful and found activities for us to do (don't turn down the camel ride) and made reservations for dinner multiple nights.    While we were having lunch our second day Mourad walked by us and asked how our stay was. He even remembered our names and was once again very friendly.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,briannanealeigh wrote a review Feb 2017,50,Once in a LIFETIME experience,This hotel was even more beautiful than the pictures on the internet. I had an amazing time here with my family during our stay in early January. The hotel is it's own paradise and a true jewel in Morocco. The lobby is elegant with a modern decor. There are fresh roses placed daily. When we first walked in the hotel we were warmly greeted with traditional Moroccan tea and very friendly employees from the doorman Mehdi to the Moroccan tea server Hakim.    The head concierge also named Mehdi was very welcoming and extremely helpful in answering our questions regarding local customs and restaurants. Mehdi was always patient kind and gracious towards my family and I during our stay. He also set us up with an English speaking tour guide Zaky who is very knowledgeable about the history and culture of Marrakech. We all thought Zaky was a fantastic tour guide. I would highly recommend him.    The rooms we stayed in were very spaciousclean and comfortable. We had balconies with a gorgeous view of the beautiful pool and courtyard. The sight is as stunning at night with the lights as it during the day. My family and I dined at the Moroccan and Buddha restaurants on the property and both were outstanding. The atmosphere and food were excellent. The breakfast buffet at the Savoy was incredible-a large and delicious assortment of a variety of foods. Throughout the entire hotel the staff was very pleasant happy and accommodating.    This is certainly a hotel you should choose to stay at if you are in Marrakech. You are guaranteed to have an exceptional experience. My family and I are looking forward to staying at the Savoy Le Grand in the near future.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Michael C wrote a review Feb 2017,50,Luxury at affordable price in Marrakesh,Truly a luxurious hotel in Marrakesh that it is affordable and an excellent cost/benefit choice. The hotel is located right next to the Menara Mall and is conveniently situated within walking distance from the main square. There is a bike station right outside the hotel which is a great option to go around the city on a nice sunny day. Be aware of the traffic though!  Service is impeccable! Rooms are spacious clean and an essence of luxury.  Hotel amenities are great! Pools are clean and nicely laid out. Restaurants and lounges are amazing. SPA is good but a bit overpriced.  Breakfast buffet is the most complete I have ever seen in the world. Perfect variety to all tastes and extremely efficient staff!  Room service was absolute perfection with local and international dished and definitely a great option for the rainy day we caught while in Marrakesh.  One downfall is that there was no bathrobes in the room only slippers.  Also no complimentary airport shuttle as in other luxury hotels.  Hotel reception and concierge were of utmost efficiency and very helpful. Concierge assisted us with booking an all-day excursion and it truly enhanced our stay in Morocco. He is very helpful and knowledgeable. I highly suggest an excursion or day trip to embrace the true Moroccan experience.  Highly recommended stay in Marrakesh for a luxurious stay yet with a local feel.

Thanks to these amazing staff my birthday was such a success from the cake and flowers left in my room to the complimentary Hammam in the spa Latifa the masseuse was amazing. I can't thank these three enough. They are a credit to the Savoy. Our suites were extremely clean and I definitely recommend booking one of these rooms as the jacuzzi bath was lush. Our room 1122 faced the main pool and we had a table and chairs and sun loungers on our huge balcony. Mourad also booked us the best table at Buddha Bar which is located next door to the hotel.

It is located near the Menara Mall next door to Buddha Bar and many restaurants. The hotel has great rooms I usually stay in the suite which is very spacious with an amazing bathroom - huge shower jacuzzi tub with a glass wall to the bedroom. The hotel has a good breakfast buffet. Service is on and off... some days better than others. The pool area is beautiful good gym and also a heated indoor pool when it's a bit cooler outside. Parking is free sometimes arduous outside but always some available in the Menara Mall underground parking. So overall very nice especially for business travelers.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Simone M wrote a review Feb 2017,40,Birthday Celebrations,"Traveled to Marrakech for 4night from the 19th Jan. Had an amazing time even though I was ill and it rained all in all Marrakesh is a must do on the travel calendar. So prior to I had arranged transfer pick up from the airport I think it was the best idea as it avoided hassles from the airport to your hotel or raid. Be prepared for a lengthy processing at immigration control as you will need to fill a landing form once in immigration plus the que is long and no one rushes in Marrakesh. It a great idea to change your money at the airport after you have collected your luggage out the baggage hall as there are better rates there. So after all that arrived at Savoy a beautiful hotel about 15 mins drive from the airport in a great location next to the Buddha bar and the me Nara plaza . On arrival you are offered Moroccan tea  a wonderful little touch immediately exposing you to the hospitality the check in service was ok we had a few hiccups due to room situations but all in all the were resolved fairly quickly the hotel staff were friendly and wanted to go the extra mile to accommodate you.The facilities despite the time of year and the weather being a little cold everything was available to you. Absolutely stunning    The beds oohh 😍😍😍😍lovely comfortable I had amazing nights rest the cleanliness of the hotel was superb and staff providing this service vey friendly . We tried the Italian restaurant it was lovely food freshly made and top notch hospitality given. That spa facilities ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ absolutely loved my treatments I will definitely be back the ladies did an amazing job on my group. However there was a little frustration with regards to paying for our treat as we did not want to add it to our rooms the payment machine appeared to not be working and took forever for them to work the bill out eventually asked I asked them to go over to the check in desk where we were able to pay 💰that took a bit away from our our relaxation. The business centre where I was sent to print out my return ticket for my departure simple stunning in all white no hassles easily accessible .    The breakfast provided a wide variety with adequate choices for everyone  nice hotel great touch I would definitely returne everything that was requested was provided including my birthday dinner booking at Buddha bar highly recommended the tour guide or company used to sight see around Marrakesh ""special kudos to Sam who was our guide we had an amazing day to the birthday cake sent up to my room great gestures .

They also don't make eye contact on reception which comes across rude    Breakfast was nice but again poor customer service with a lot of staff standing around not really doing much the service from the pool bar was very slow    I cant wait to go back to Marrakech but would never go back to this hotel,Date of stay: September 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sarah33338

Had reserved a superior room and at the check in the clerk said he made an upgrade but I didn't see any difference with the pictures and description of the room booked..may the upgrade was for the room with a partial view of the secondary pool?  The room was big the bed was huge and very comfortable; complimentary Nespresso coffee and a balcony.  The room location not overlooking the main pool was surely more quiter.  Breakfast buffet was big and good but the table service was a bit slow had to ask two times and to different waiters for a coffee. Nice the violinist playing music.  From the hotel there is a direct access to the mall.  Beware that if you buy something to eat or drink in the mall and you want to bring it back to the room you can't hotel security will search you then it's not allowed. (First time in all my travels).

I was reading some reviews of this hotel and I agree with all the excellent ones! People with bad reviews obviously have mistaken this hotel for a crappy one! The staff is so friendly and caring especially with children. Since we've came back to gloomy London weather my daughter says everyday ( literally everyday) that we need to move to Morocco! Medi who was at the concierge helped arrange our tour to the Atlas Mountains. We booked the package the hotel offers. we got a lovely car with the most friendly driver and tour guide. The atlas mountain is beautiful!  The next day we booked a city tour. Again we got lovely service. All thanks to Medi who arranged it for us.  The breakfast was the highlight of our stay! Food was fresh and hot and yummy! We had dinner in the Italian restaurant and the Moroccan restaurant at the hotel. Amazing food! And again very friendly service.  There was live music in the evenings. The singer was beautiful and friendly. My daughter loved the attention she got from her and loved her singing.  Lastly I would like to thank Mourad from guest relations for his exceptional hospitality. He would walk up to us and have lovely conversations. Helped us with anything we needed. A real gem of a person.  To everyone planning on going to marrakech ..... stay at this hotel. Location is very central. Don't follow any bad reviews.

The food was great and the number of restaurants and bars at the Savoy provided for a sufficient choice as one would expect.    Two tips if you are on your way to Marrakech...  We flew from Stansted...I can highly recommend the services and staff of APH Airport Parking...their facility is next door to the Holiday Inn Hotel (where I stayed the night before the early flight out)...They are very flexible with times which helps if you arrive early or late...and they got us to and from the terminal efficiently and with good humour (yes even at 4.00am)...  The second tip is TRY NOT to use Moneycorp at Stansted (or anywhere) to exchange any sterling to Moroccan Dirhams. They gave me a rate of 8.7 and when I asked if this really was the exchange rate they said it was and that sterling had taken a beating... I later found out that the quoted exchange rate on that day was over 12... obviously less the usual appropriate commission which would not be anywhere near Moneycorp's usurious rate which amounted to over 25%...  There are many ATM's in Marrakech which will give you up to 2000 Dirhams per transaction at your bank's normal exchange rate which is usually very acceptable and far far less than Moneycorp. The banks that I saw in Marrakech also had exchange counters if you want to take sterling with you...you should get around 11.5 in the exchange.    Have fun!",Date of stay: January 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B16gls
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,JunelovesMarrakech wrote a review Jan 2017,50,Outstanding Hotel with Excellent Service,My husband and I as well as our two adult children recently stayed at this wonderful hotel. The lobby of the hotel is decorated beautifully with fresh roses displayed each day. Complimentary mint tea is available in the lobby for the guests. We had two spacious rooms which both had large balconies with a table and chairs that overlooked the hotel's stunning pool. The beds were very comfortable and the room was impeccably clean. The service at this hotel was excellent. The front desk bellmen and housekeeping were very pleasant and efficient.    Of particular note to compliment is the Head Concierge Mr. Medi Gbhaghda. Medi was extremely helpful in providing us with information about the local customs restaurants outside the hotel and setting us up with an excellent tour guide Zacky. Zacky spoke excellent English and was extremely knowledgeable about the history behind the Marrakech sites. One of the many things that made Medi stand out as an excellent Concierge was that he was genuinely interested in hearing about our experiences in Marrakech both in the hotel and outside the hotel. He was ALWAYS pleasant kind and patient in answering our many questions and offering helpful advice. He is indeed an asset to this lovely hotel.    The breakfast buffet offered at this hotel is incredible!! A variety of foods is offered and it is indeed delicious. Pancakes made to order omelettes eggs meats all types of breads fruits yogurt dessert etc are a few of the items that are offered. We dined at the Moroccan restaurant in the hotel one evening and had a delicious Moroccan meal in a beautiful setting where two gentlemen were playing traditional Moroccan music. We also dined at the Buddha Bar another uniquely designed restaurant adjacent to this hotel that has an elegant atmosphere with its center having a large gold Buddha. Our meals again were delicious.    This hotel is also connected to a modern mall with a variety of stores huge child's amusement center and fast food restaurants that are located on an outside terrace. A wonderful plus to this hotel.    My family and I will definitely return to this fabulous hotel in Marrakech. I don't usually write hotel reviews but I felt this was definitely a hotel that should be commended for its high quality service as well as its beautiful accommodations and excellent location.,Date of stay: January 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Los Angeles, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JunelovesMarrakech

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,ALP1215 wrote a review Jan 2017,50,Excellent Hotel and Staff,I have had the pleasure of staying at the Savoy Le Grand for both personal travel and work travel - all of the times I have stayed there I have thoroughly enjoyed myself and find it to be my favorite hotel in Marrakech. Everything you could possibly want or need is either in the hotel or nearby - swimming pools (both indoor and outdoor) spa nightclubs variety of restaurants comfortable accommodations friendly and helpful staff a mall and grocery store right next door and walkable to Menara Gardens and Jemaa el-Fnaa. I stayed at the Savoy for three weeks for work and had the pleasure of working with their staff day and night to meet a multitude of hotel room needs and issues that would spring up many times at the last minute. Their staff was incredibly professional accommodating helpful and timely in meeting and exceeding all of our requests. They were outstanding to work with and I always feel incredibly welcome whenever I stay even for personal travel.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,farhanarkan wrote a review Jan 2017,40,Beautiful hotel,Arrived at the hotel and had an issue with the rooms. however Laila in reservations was kind enough to help me and went out of her way to make sure the matter was sorted.  The hotel is a nice hotel but what really stands out is the porters and the staff during breakfast service.  This is the second time i've stayed at this hotel and many of the staff remembered me by name which was touching  I was greeted by the outlet manager Morad who is such a lovely guy The chefs Saleheddin Latifa Mohamed and Sabria are amazing chefs. The food really is some of the best i've had in a buffet breakfast and the service provided by the staff was exceptional. The people who stood out in particular and should be applauded for there commitment are Chaimae Saffah Kaoutar Mustafa Mellouki and the brilliant tea boys Imad and Hicham.  I met a really nice young gentleman called Oussama Ghafari who was very warm and helpful and the guys at front desk Badr and Lotfi went out of there way to when i had a couple of issues  Overall the hotel is really nice for those wanting nice surroundings and polite friendly staff and I would recommend staying here.,Date of stay: December 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/farhanarkan
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Jgoyeneche64 wrote a review Jan 2017,30,"All the great, ruined by little details !!",Hotel as a whole is great. Breakfast is amazing and the concierge service is unique. Rooms were clean and confortable with great spaces and ammenities. Unfortunately I had an issue that in my opinion was not handled properly. Our second night was a nightmare since at 12.30 am some workers started working with drills and hammers. I called to alert the hotel but didn't know anything about this work. I had to call at least 5 times before someone decided to take an action which was moving us to other room. We had to pack all our stuff at 3:00 AM . That is crazy. Of course we were not able to sleep any more since we were apointed for a tour and we had to woke up early. I understand this things coud happen but the difference between the good and the great is the way you react when this situations appear. In addition to that bad night we didn't eve receive an apologie letter from the hotel. This seems pretty normal to them.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Alkhaja-Faisal wrote a review Jan 2017,50,Exceptional Hospitality & Stay at Savoy,I stayed at the Savoy during the first week of January 2017. it's an amazing hotel I don't really know how to explain my experience but here it is.    First of all I don’t submit reviews that often even though I travel a lot but this time I believe the Savoy and their team deserve this review for all their efforts and making my journey exceptional.    Two notable people made our stay unforgettable. Mr. Murad from guest relations and Mr. Khaled at the reception. Well done gentlemen. Very professional resourceful people.    Mr. Murad whom I didn’t know before this stay approached me while checking in and introduced himself and immediately started assisting and guiding. He was kind of to take us to the suite show us all sort of different things the hotel offers.    Throughout the stay Murad was always there even when he was off duty. Exceptionally hospitality and service well done Murad. This kind of service is priceless and what I always look for.    The hotel is luxurious. Beautiful and elegant lobby large swimming pool (even though I didn’t use it this time it was cold but I think this is the place to be during the summer time). Checkout some of the photos we took.    I’m from Dubai and we have the best hotels in the world and to find something close to that level of hotels we have here in Dubai is a challenge every time I travel. Fortunately I didn’t face this challenge at Savoy as it’s a high-end luxurious and elegant hotel.    Staff: Extremely friendly staff from the valet all the way to the housekeeping. Well done guys you made this trip unforgettable.    Location: The best location without exaggeration! It’s in the heart of the city it’s connect to the mall (you have carrefour Apple store barber shop….etc and you can access it from inside the hotel). Moreover it’s within a walking distance to Buddha Bar it’s actually attached and part of the hotel.    The room/suite: We booked the two bedroom suite which was beautiful. Two master bedrooms with a living room and a huge balcony spanning over the complete suite. The main master bedroom had a walk-in closet and a huge bathroom. Spacious shower room with a rain shower.    Room Service: Great food fast service and again super friendly staff.    Wifi: Fast speed internet for FREE.    Price: Very reasonable for such a hotel with this class and luxury.    I didn’t experience everything the hotel offers but I will on my next visit which is soon. Don’t forget to have the Moroccan tea at the reception (it’s FREE by the way).    You won’t be disappointed try it for yourself and stay at the Savoy and thank me later on :)    Savoy is the hotel to stay at when you visit Marrakech.,Date of stay: January 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alkhaja-Faisal

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,hrh747 wrote a review Jan 2017,40,Impressive accomodation,I stayed at this hotel from Jan-7-2017 to Jan-11-2017. I would have given it the highest rating but there were some issues. Here are the pros and the cons with the Savoy Hotel.  Pros:  The hotel is located in a super convenient location. It is in a walking distance to Medina (the old city) the train station and it is right by Mohammad VI blvd the longest stretch in Africa. It is adjacent to the beautiful Menara Mall and the Buddha Bar restaurant. Staffs are amiable and courteous. The rooms are spacious and nicely decorated with view of the pool and the court yard. There is an expresso machine in each room with several free packs of expressos and 2 complimentary waters. The hotel has two large court yards 2 outdoor swimming pools 2 indoor swimming pools and several choices of dining rooms and bars. There is a complimentary mint tea (typical Moroccan tea) service at lobby and FREE WIFI is available throughout the hotel and the rooms. Make sure to book a night at the Buddha Bar Restaurant next door they have great food with 3 segments of dance and acrobatic performance. The daily breakfast is absolutely impressive and delicious.  Cons:  The hotel doesn’t provide currency exchange service and if you need to change money urgently you have to go to the bank or currency exchange office steps away from the hotel. This is fine except on Sundays banks and currency exchange outfits are closed so make sure to change enough before Sunday.  The concierge people aren’t very pro-active in giving you insightful information. For instance I made a reservation through concierge for the Buddha bar restaurant next door for the Monday evening primarily to see the show and of course they failed to tell me that on Mondays there aren’t any performances later I found that out from other guest and I had to cancel and re-arrange my plans on the last minutes for the Monday night.  On a Sunday morning I asked the concierge for currency exchange and she told me they don’t have such service at the hotel and so she recommended that I should change at the currency exchange place next to the Menara Mall (70 meters away) but she failed to tell me that the currency exchange venues are closed on Sunday in Marrakesh.  The hotel pools are FREE to use but they will charge for Jacuzzi because that is part of the SPA services.  In general I recommend this hotel for its location services esthetics and courteous staff but bear in mind its mentioned limitations.,Date of stay: January 2017,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Tehran, Iran",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hrh747

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,466Smits wrote a review Jan 2017,40,Western and Moroccan ambience,Savoy manages to blend western and Moroccan ambience so the culture shock is somewhat muted if you stay here and visit the tourist spots. It is a luxurious spacious hotel. Rooms are big and bed and breakfast is sumptuous. Showers work very well. The baths in the rooms are quirky and delightful. There are little balconies which give a spacious feel. They organise day trips well. Pools are delightful and sitting around n the sun in winter is a great way to spend time. The indoor pool toilets were badly maintained.  Restaurants are pretty but the staff can be a bit quirky. One gets the feeling that they are trying their best and those that do really need a pat on the back. They love it. The use of the gym is a challenge as one shares lockers with the spa guests (I think) and the girls manning the spa try to hide keys to lockers.They need a management policy on this rather than this strange game of hide and seek.  If you have booked early (booking.com) and got a good price you will most probably get rooms without great views.,Date of stay: December 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Milton Keynes, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/466Smits

I also booked the transport with the hotel which to my surprise was a brand new Mercedes S Class driver was very polite and helpful.    On arrival we were given mint tea hope we checked in which took a little while.    Rooms were very spacious with 2 double beds and a cot for the baby. We had a pool view room with a great view of the massive pool.    The breakfast was brilliant and had a massive selection really impressed. I wasn't impressed with the food at the Italian restaurant.    The pool is spectacular really big but it is freezing cold it was 40 degrees when we were out there so the cold water wasn't an issue it took a while for the kids to get used to the cold water.    Location I have to say was a major plus point for Savoy Le Grand as it is 10 minutes on a taxi to the main Madina square it it next door to Menara mall a nice night time destination for family's as there's loads of food and dessert places as well as some decent shops. There is also kerffour (Major super market chain) next door so you can pick up all necessity's for next to nothing from here.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,AMCollins wrote a review Dec 2016,40,Very enjoyable stay- don't let bad reviews put you off .....,My partner and I spent a week here in September and it was a very enjoyable experience. Yes the very mixed reviews worried us but overall the pros for the hotel convinced to go ahead.  We had a big modern room with a pool view which was spotlessly clean and the standard of the entire complex was extremely high. The staff were more polite than friendly but this may well be a cultural thing - one morning when I had a bit of a bad stomach a very kind waitress brought be some camomile tea without being asked. Yes the breakfast service overall was a bit chaotic but so what we weren't in a rush anywhere and the selection at breakfast was wide and varied. Service can be slow in all areas.  Our bags were checked on a regular basis entering and leaving the hotel but we were never stopped bringing in water or snacks alcohol I can't speak for.  Overall I would definitely recommend - we got a 4.5 star hotel ( sorry it's not 5 star in my opinion) for a 3 star price and who doesn't love a good deal?,Date of stay: September 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,kerry,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AMCollins

Just in the middle of the Hivernage the hotel sits next to the luxurious Buddha Bar and the diverse Menara Mall all of this at just about a 20 minute walk from Koutoubia Mosque. The rooms are amazing clean full of amenities and the showers are stunning. The pools are super nice and you get access to the outdoor one (if you are brave enough to use it in winter) and the indoor one although you have to pay to access the sauna and heated pool in the spa. Breakfast was delicious and there was an incredibly vast choice of both international and moroccan food. All in all the hotel is highly recommended if you're looking to experience pure luxury.,Date of stay: December 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/egondargi
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,MChris76 wrote a review Dec 2016,50,Concierge is the best,We found this hotel online based on trip advisor reviews and it did not disappoint. Decent sized rooms with a beautifull bathroom. We were unsure about what to expect from the size and english since its Morocco but got a really good experience there. The people that worked there where good in english and very good helping us if we needed directions etc. We felt that the enjoyment of our stay mattered to them. Special thanks to Mehdi (chief concierge) and his team who helped us find restaurants recommended tours and activities. thank you so much guys and looking forward to our next visit.,Date of stay: December 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MChris76

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Meo129 wrote a review Dec 2016,50,5 star,Me n my husband stayed there for three nights in December. It was a real 5 star experience- service was amazing- very nice n modern hotel with big indoor n outdoor pools. However you will have to pay extra (ridiculous amount) to use their jacuzzi n sauna. Their spa has beautiful setting n got variety of treatments. Breakfast was excellent. Only complaint I have is that the curtains in our room were not providing us black out so I woke up early due to light.  Staff is very polite n helpful n service was very quick.    Another big plus of this hotel is it's prime location- only 20 min walk from jame- al- fana n 25 mins to their new town.  Overall I am very happy with this hotel n I will highly recommend it to anyone going there.,Date of stay: December 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Meo129
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,AZuberSarwar wrote a review Dec 2016,50,Everything was Perfect!,My stay at The Savoy was perfect from start to finish.  I stayed for 2 nights with my family we've all come back with great big smiles on our faces.The hospitality was warm the staff are so helpful and genuine.    The day we arrived we were served Moroccan tea which was absolutely refreshing after a journey.  We made friends with everyone at Savoy including the kitchen staff.  My birthday was on the following day about 15 members of the staff gathered around our breakfast table and bought my birthday cake over and sang a wonderful Happy Birthday song in Arabic.  I most certainly wont forget my stay in Savoy and can not wait to go back.  I have visited many hotels but Savoy has been the most memorable one out of them all.  The food in the hotel was delicious the room service was punctual and prompt to every request.  The actual hotel from inside is so comfortable and smell exquisite the interior decor is wonderful i couldn't stop taking photos. The hotel is kept so immaculately clean and polished to perfection.

Two giant double beds  my own personal Lavazza coffee machine giant flat screen tv balcony with furniture welcome fruit platter and assortment of Morroccan suites. The bathroom was straight out of a magazine with an amazing waterfall shower . I had to pinch myself! I took a tour of the hotels 4 stunning bars  2 outdoor pools  the spa with a really good gym and the Italian and Morroccan restaurants and was gutted that I hadn't stayed here the first night. But what really leaves a lasting impression are the staff who are constantly ensuring you are enjoying your stay and treating you like a VIP. I've already planned my next trip for February .

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,explorer2790 wrote a review Dec 2016,50,What a hotel,By far one of the best hotels in Marrakech.    We liked it soo much that we cancelled another hotel booking and came back to stay here.    The service and breakfast is 5*.    The property is vast we made use of the indoor pool which was fab for this time of the year.    Would recommend the spa too.    The adjacent shopping mall is very convenient with decent food shops. Close to the airport and both the old medina and new part of Marrakech.    Taxis are easy to find.    They have a very annoying door check policy which is bizarre on one occasion they stopped me from bringing in my half drunken water bottle.    The property also lacks from attention to detail such as wonky plugs very amateurish grouting in the bathroom to paint splashes on the wall if they can in time add the attention to detail and get rid of their stupid bag check policy this would absolutely be a 5* hotel.    Would we go back and stay here again possibly if theY get rid of their door policy but theres soo much choice in Marrakech now that there is not one single thing that stands out compared to all the nearby 5* hotels.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,A B wrote a review Dec 2016,50,Wow!,I stayed at Savoy Le Grand Hotel for a week and observed the following:  - Very dedicated pleasant and efficient staff.  - Breakfast buffet is excellent with choices for everyone.  - Clean rooms with all the required amenities. Love the shower and hygiene products provided.  - On-site Moroccan restaurant was very good.  - Hammam and massage at the spa were very good as well.  - Several amenities nearby. With that comes a little bit of street noise that could slightly be heard from the room at times depending on location within the complex I guess but it is greatly offset by not having to drive if one choses not to.    Mourad responsible for Customer Relations is pleasant caring and takes his job seriously as he should.    All in all a very positive experience. I will certainly be going back!

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Aye Grunser wrote a review Nov 2016,10,Don't go even if they offer you the room for free....,It's one of the most shabbiest dirty and badly managed place I have seen in my life.  Somehow the owner got the idea to build a massive resort hotel that would attract all the tourists on the all-inclusive package who don't mind anything except that they get to lie in the pool and get some free drinks and food.  So everywhere you saw were these hoards of people who were lying getting toasted not wanting anything else.  This has led the staff to think that their job is to just hang around chit chat and have no reason to get engaged in running the hotel. No one knows anything in the breakfast room no clue about where food is whether it is coming or it is over. One day they decided to change the venue and when we reached the original venue they pushed us away like we were some beggars looking for free food.  The rooms are poorly made. We upgraded to the VIP suite but I can tell you it is still the worst suite you will visit in your life.  I mean the owner has gone the extra mile to build a cheap and tacky resort and it shows so well.  Some clever man has put a curtain in between the bathroom and bedroom inside out. So you could see a person using the toilet from the bedroom while from the bathroom side you cannot see anything i to the bedroom. We didn't even try and explain it to the staff because their English and desire to serve is so totally non existent that it would have taken us 4 days to get something done.  The pool - there are no tiles in the pool. But all you have is a rubbery layer that warps and folds everywhere. And he has painted it in the lines to look like tiles.    The food is terrible music will burn your ears and service is non existent.

The check in process was great although we did have to wait as other people were in front of us. We were shown to our room 2425 it was a breath taking pool view with 2 double beds a bathroom and a shower room inside it. Bathroom was SPOTLESS it was honestly perfect.  The pool area was great when the sun shone very clean although water was freezing. Our room rate came with breakfast such a wide selection of foods cold meats cheeses breads sushi omlette and eggs that can be made for you great service at breakfast. We enjoyed morroccan restaurant food was very delicious.  We enjoyed the souk markets bought lots of things and I enjoyed the art of haggling we did rent a guide as I reckon we would of gotten lost.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,AmSoo wrote a review Nov 2016,50,Great hotel and great customer services,Great stay at the Savoy with my sister earlier this year. The pictures do not do the hotel justice. The lobby is stunning and smells gorgeous. I wish I could bottle the smell!! We were originally given a room above the restaurant which was noisy but the staff were more than happy to move us to a pool view room. Lovely room two double beds and good shower facilities and products. Pool facilities were great and it's generally quiet around the pool all day. The hotel has a private entrance to the mall next door which is convenient... however it's opening times seemed to change daily which was confusing. Breakfast was not great for me being a coeliac as there were not many gluten free options.,Date of stay: June 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"The Royal Town of Sutton Coldfield, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aksooms

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Rosie1943 wrote a review Nov 2016,20,A never to be forgotten experience!!,My friend and I were guests for a week in mid October. We arrived at the Hotel at 11am and were informed that check-in time was 2pm. I explained to the receptionist that we had travelled since 3am and that we would be grateful if she could find us a room before 2pm and that as had been requested at the time of the booking we wanted a twin room. She said she would endeavour to get a room for us and told us to sit in reception. An hour later I again asked how much longer we would have to wait there. She then suggested we go to the small restaurant beside the pool and have some lunch. We decided to do that rather than hang around for another hour or so. The lunch was awful - a very thin heavily salted cheese and tomato pizza - without the tomatoes!! An hour later we went back to reception and again asked for a room. Yet again told to sit and wait ....and wait.....and wait. After speaking to three other receptionists whilst the original one was on the phone we both started to feel very upset and by now it was after 2pm. We were then allocated a room but this turned out to be one with a double bed which we refused. Back to reception and the receptionist told me that the two young men I was standing next to had also been waiting to check-in since 11am. All other people who had arrived at that time had long since been given rooms. Shortly after that the Receptionist arrived with a room key but that was handed to the two young men. By now I was furious and extremely upset. I told her that my friend and I were both over 70 years of age had travelled since 3am and were completely exhausted. I felt as though the holiday had been ruined before it had barely started. My friend who was sitting in reception was approached by Mourad who was extremely kind. She explained the situation to him and he said he would try to resolve the problem. He asked us if we would like a drink - first time one had been offered. We finally got a room at 4pm - after a wait of five hours!!  The food in the Italian Restaurant was disappointing. We had one meal in the Morrocan Restaurant and the food was plentiful and very well prepared. The waiter was charming and explained the various dishes. The only drawback there was the very loud music from the two musicians which drowned out having any conversation. On the last night we went back to the Italian Restaurant and decided to have the soup and the sweet course. The minestrone soup consisted of a few small chopped courgettes and carrots in a very thin tomato liquid with a piece of lambs lettuce and an artichoke leaf floating on top. The vegetables were hard and had obviously not been cooked for more than a few minutes. We managed to eat half of it before giving up. However the ice cream was delicious!!  The breakfasts were plentiful with lots of choice - I loved the pancakes and scrambled eggs. The little cakes too were beautiful. Milk jugs seemed to be in short supply. When we asked for milk for our tea the waiter came back with milk in a teacup.  The bedroom was beautiful and spacious and the beds were extremely comfortable. However there were no towelling bathrobes or slippers and only one coffee cup. The cleaners were very pleasant. One in particular was very kind but I didn't know her name otherwise I would have added that to the comments. My friend had become unwell half way through the holiday and the cleaner recognised that she was struggling to breath and quickly organised for a paramedic to come to the room. Fortunately my friend had recovered by the time he arrived. The cleaner has to be commended for her quick thinking and her kindness afterwards.  Mourad was at all times very courteous and helpful.  All in all I would have to say we had good value for the price we paid but the speed and efficiency at check-in were non existent and the same applied to the staff friendliness at check-in.,Date of stay: October 2016,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Milton Keynes, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rosie1943

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,karl786 wrote a review Nov 2016,40,Top Hotel,"This is a new hotel located next door to menara mall Buddha bar and 'W Club'.    The valet service is very helpful and the overall service is of a very high standard.    You will be hard pressed to find better service at a hotel in marrakech and I've stayed in over 10 decent hotels here now.    They are trying to sell a Dubai-style experience with this hotel and they are pretty close in every way.    ...after taking a left turn illegally the hotel staff even helped me out of a pickle with the police (thank u ""Lamiye"" !).    The entrance is very grand as is the pool area.    The breakfast is quite possibly the best I have ever experienced. The breakfast buffet and service is second to none.    The room was large and very well fitted; really good quality.    So the only gripe I had was this.... we were given a room at the far far end of the hotel and asked for an upgrade. After 4 hours of waiting we managed to get another room that was on the ground floor facing the main pool.    ... we didn't want a suite but it was the only above-ground-floor option available and they refused to give it up even after 4 hours of waiting.    Perhaps it was a bit cheeky but after 4 hours of waiting I think they should have given it....

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,asb18 wrote a review Nov 2016,40,Great hotel let down by untrained staff,The hotel itself is lovely and the staff are friendly. However the overall customer service experience was very poor due to inexperienced and relatively untrained staff which led to a lack of organisation and administration. It took almost 5 hours to check in a member in our party was charged twice and one party could not check out as they were told they had already completed the process the day before which is clearly ridiculous and a great shame as the hotel itself has the potential of fulfilling its 5 start status.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Travelguru1007 wrote a review Nov 2016,30,Service here is a complete joke.,"Problems began at check in where it took our group over an hour to get deposit paid on card and passport checks done. We were earlier than check in time and no rooms were ready (which was expected) so we had to come back later to pick up keys. After a wander into town we returned to the hotel to pick up keys and unpack in the rooms. All of the areas of the hotel are very nice and you cannot fault the pool / lobby / bars / restaurants - they are all laid out very well and spacious with nice decor. When arriving at the pool bar furthest away from reception (close to the breakfast restaurant) we ordered some beers and sat poolside. When going up for the next round we were told they had run out of beers. Looking across the pool there is another bar as well as various other bars inside. I asked if they could kindly go to another bar and restock their fridge so as we didn't have to go wandering round to various bars in search of drinks as we just wanted to sit at the pool and relax. The 2 guys at the bar said they wouldn't go and restock their fridge anywhere and we would have to go to another bar and get our own drinks and bring them back. At this point a man in a suit walked behind the bar so presumably a food and beverage manager or manager of some kind. I advised him that we had recently got to the pool bar and they have run out of beer I asked one of the bar men if they could restock the bar and they said no. I asked him if there was any chance he could restock their fridge as we wanted to sit at the pool for another couple of hours and have a few beers. He said ""absolutely no problem sir we will get that sorted for you right away"". Excellent I thought that would be problem solved. Anyway the chap who originally said no to restocking the fridge returned from another bar with some drinks and was clearly furious that he had to do some work and was screaming and shouting at the 2nd barman who originally said they wouldn't bring over any beer. We were served our our drinks reluctantly and were then shocked when we went to get the next round to find out that they had run out! The barman that was shouting at his colleague had by then calmed down and said he would go to another bar and get however many beers we wanted but he wanted to open all of the beers on the table that we were sat at rather than put them in the bar fridge! In the end we settled with him putting all the beers in a bucket on the table with ice - all very strange.  Service in the Italian restaurant was very good and the food was good too so you can find service in some places.  Checkout from the hotel was no better than check in. The rooms had been paid from the card that was left with them for the deposit and when asked for a receipt this seemed like an impossible ask. At any hotel that had a reasonable level of customer service they would have had a receipt in an envelope ready to pick up straight away. They couldn't locate the transaction but they knew the rooms had been paid for from the card. It took 30 minutes to obtain a receipt for the payment that was taken which was ridiculous and stressed out some of the group as it meant we were half an hour later than anticipated arriving at the airport.  Be prepared for a lack of any sensible procedures and lack of anyone wanting to do any work at Marrakech airport and allow 2.5 hours to get to your gate. Most annoying was the procedure of having to queue up at the airline check in desks to get your online boarding card stamped and ripped in half - to confirm you are a valid passenger! Any other airport I have been to can accept the scanned barcode on your phone or printed boarding card and your passport as proof that you are a valid traveller. At Marrakech they won't let you in to departures without the stamp. It would have been helpful if the Ryanair check in desk member had advised us this after we all queued for 45 minutes at the check in desks to drop 2 cases with them. So after not being allowed into departures without the stamp on our boarding cards we had to get back in the check in desk queue that we had just left and queue again for another 30 minutes!",Date of stay: October 2016,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Saffron Walden, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travelguru1007

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,RehanHassan wrote a review Nov 2016,50,Why You Need To Stay At Savoy If You Come To Marrakech...Yes Really!,If you are thinking to come to Marrakech whether it is for 2 day or 2 weeks the Savoy Hotel will not dissappaoint you.    Here's Why...    Location: It's in prime location for outgoing and seeing the beautiful city by walk or by Taxi. The great Jam el Afna is walking distance if you dare (20+ min) or a 5 mins taxi ride.    Gueliz Shopping centre and the Train station is within 5 mins and super easy accessible if you want to go to the Mall.    but what is even Cooler it is virtually connected to a Mall (Menara mall) that has endless food places and restaurants to if you want to snack on even if you want to get a great haircut they have a cool Barbers there.    Carrefour for Food is next door too 10 seconds walk along side Budda Bar which has some really awesome Dancers and Sushi!! Yes I know a crazy mix...You will love it.    Airport is about 10 mins away and super easy pay about 100 Dhms to go or come back however I happily paid 150 even because the driver was a nice man.    Rooms    I initially came to stay for 4 days and ended up staying for 3 weeks at this hotel and I am now back for the second time staying at the same place.    The hotel has a really awesome Lobby The Restaurants has has a huge upgrade and you have a super wide selection of food.    I have stayed in around 4 different rooms and believe they are very clean and space all serving great balcony's with great Pool views.    The showers work nice and so did all the air conditioning along with wide cupboards so store all your clothes in. Our rooms even had desks and big TV's.    I never had any issue with any of these at all.    Front Desk Staff    The people at his hotel are very friendly always smiling and going the extra mile whenever you need to.    The front desk girls also are really nice and friendly...Hajar and Co looked after us very well and made us feed welcomed.    Guest Relations    Guest Relations at this hotel are by far the best that I have come across Mourad who helped me any thing and every thing I could need.    The Bellman also were very friendly always got us a taxi whenever needed some really great guys there.    The DJ.    Mido the Dj is an awesome guy very entertaining ensuring all the guest are really enjoying the music around the pool and the entertainment. He really understands how to keep his guest entertained If you see him go say Hi to him. You will like him.    Restaurants    The food here is really good no complaints from moroccan Italian to the room service who are very passionate and polite. You even get served tea upon arrival. :)    So If you are looking for an amazing stay and are in search for a great 5 Star hotel then do not hesitate to make Savoy your first choice.    Enjoy your Trip.    Rehan,Date of stay: November 2016,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Marrakech, Morocco",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RehanHassan
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Lisa C wrote a review Nov 2016,10,The hotel with the pretty face and poor personality,I recently stayed at this hotel with my husband and young baby as part of a large wedding party. We all travelled from the UK.    I felt like I was working at the hotel rather than staying there as a guest. It was hard work!!    The staff need to actively listen to their guests. There is a massive cultural divide between the staff and the guests. It seems like the staff say yes to everything and don't follow through. They do not listen and some staff do not apologise which is very frustrating. If they are trying to attract European guests they should understand the mindset of the European guest.    We contacted the hotel 4 times before arrival to arrange a hotel pick up with a car seat for our 6 month old baby a cotbed and a kettle to sterilise baby bottles and prepare formula.  We arrived at 7pm and had to wait 1 hour for our room.  None of the items that we requested were ready.  We had to wait until 9pm for a bed for our 6 month old baby and we didn't receive a kettle until midnight.  Our ground floor patio door wouldn't lock and we had to wait until midnight for the duty manager to organise a maintenance man to fix the lock.  The duty manager advised that he would waive the first night. Later on both he and other staff members said that this wasn't possible.    After many hours at reception complaining we got a room upgrade (we had no room key for 3 hours) and we were given a massage but the night wasn't waived.    I can't describe in words how difficult this whole experience was. It was incredibly painful.    On the upside we did come across Mourad who was the only logical and human member of staff. He followed through and got results. He also understood our mentality and managed to make us smile.    The breakfast staff were also very pleasant spending time cheering our baby up.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Tom wrote a review Nov 2016,20,We cannot recommend this hotel,On the surface it's lavish and glitzy; it's huge as well. Our room was a long walk from reception.  However that was not the main issue for us. We arrived at 4.30pm to find the room being used as a base for house-keeping staff. It was full of bed linen and cleaning materials. Moreover it was not the twin room we'd booked. The cleaners were in no hurry to leave so we sat there while one went to report to HQ about the room problem. We tried to ring reception a couple of times but all we got was a recorded message saying they were busy.  After 15 minutes I hiked back to reception via a Monty Pythonesque lift system (very slow and took you to all the floors you didn't want to go to) to be told there were not other rooms (incredible in such a vast hotel). No apology or expression of regret.  We were told an additional bed would be put in the room while we were out that evening.  We returned at 10.30pm to find a child's fold-away bed in the room with a pile of bedlinen on top and no quilt/duvet.  Once again back to the distant reception where we were told someone would come with blankets. Given the hour and the unreliability already experienced we told them not to bother.  As we were getting into bed half an hour later the night manager arrived saying 'I understand you have a problem'! He was dispatched and then 15 minutes later a member of staff arrived with blankets!!  So all in all a very poor performance. No apology as we checked out.,Date of stay: October 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,North Yorkshire,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TomNorthYorkshire

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Adam R wrote a review Oct 2016,40,Great for couples and excellent location in the city.,Excellent location much much better than the other large complexes further south. Walkable to the Medina with Buddha bar and the mall next door. Check in was handled very well by the customer service manager (who remembered our names 4 days later on departure nice touch). The complex is beautiful with clean areas fresh roses; the ambiance is spot on. The room was ample in size with the biggest bed I have ever seen. Bathroom is nice but the shower sometimes went from boiling to freezing randomly. The onsite restaurants are excellent for breakfast (get the included breakfast you wont be disappointed) but average and very very overpriced for supper. Get a taxi to Lattiude31 or go next door to Buddha bar or the cafe outside the mall. The concierge is very handy and bend over backwards for you. It's well worth using them for an excursion to the Atlas mountains our guide Marbrouk Hamid was second to none. We had a minor issue with our late check out but that was eventually resolved. All in all excellent for couples - the surrounding area feels safe clean and new and close to all major attractions. The only thing that lets it down is expensive evening restaurants and the ubiquitous problem you'd get across the city with language barriers from some staff. Otherwise I would stay again in a heartbeat.,Date of stay: October 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Colchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adamrT7743OW

Check in took over an hour  2. Receptionist were moody and typically not helpful. Palmed us of to all areas of the team  3. We had a 6 month old baby and we specifically asked for a crib and kettle in the room prior to the trip. This was confirmed by them via email and low and behold no cot or kettle in the room  4. Being on the ground floor security was lame... Patio lock did not work and we had to call out a maintainence man to fix it once we finally got access to the room. This got addressed at midnight..grr  5. Ordering drinks took and ice age but they were very quick for us to sign the bill. Even if its wasnt even the drinks we ordered    The first night meant that my baby had to go to bed unfed and having a disturbed sleep (due to the numerous calls i had to make to chase down a kettle ask for bottled water fix the patio lock)    I spent the 1.5 days arguing with the management team in reception and finally they admitted this was poor service... They did upgrade us to a suite and sent a VIP basket of goodies... Again they managed to balls that up. They sent a fruit basket and biscuits at in the middle of the night when our baby was sleeping which then woke him up.    I requested for money to be taken of the bill but they refused to do this however offered 2 complimentary massages for my wife and I.    Overall we paid a lot of money for a nice hotel but severely let down by the service. If you plan to stay there then speak to Mourad. He was the only bright spark in this poorly run hotel.    Be warned your better off spending your money elsewhere,Date of stay: October 2016,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GugiSingh

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Globe Trotter wrote a review Oct 2016,50,Really wonderful stay,We stayed for 4 nights while celebrating my fiancee's birthday. The staff at the hotel really went out of their way to make her feel special. I just mentioned at check in that it was her birthday and there was a big flurry of activity - ending with the manager bringing us tea and upgrading us to a suite (which was bigger than our flat at home!) The look on her face when we walked in was priceless!  I came down the next day to thank the receptionist and the manager. There was a different girl behind the desk - and when she found out about the birthday there was another flurry of activity and the next time we came to the room there were rose petals scattered and a chocolate cake under a silver tray.    .........What if it's not your birthday?    Still a cracking place.  Breakfast every morning is a real feast! Enormous selections of pastries cooked breakfasts fruits yoghurts cold cuts and (best of all) 2 chefs who'd make you pancakes crepes waffles (even parathas!) - on demand. The only thing I would say is to go early on the weekend. The spread of food really is impressive and when the masses arrive - some can get over-excited and it can get a little frantic. (I saw a woman in a panic grab about 15 fairy cakes and nothing else...at 10 in the morning).  The concierge was charming helpful and seemed to work 24h a day. There must have been hundreds of people staying but he remembered our names every time we popped down. All the staff really went out of their way to make us feel welcome.  Location wise - doesn't look great from the outside (it's attached to a mall) - but once inside it really is impressive. The old town is a 20 min walk or a £3 taxi ride away. The outdoor pools are enormous (and pretty) but unheated so could be chilly if you're going out of summer.  Rooms were clean. Bed was super comfy. The suite has a bath/jacuzzi as well as a walk in shower.  All in all - a really great place.,Date of stay: October 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Coventry, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlobeTrotter20XD6
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Mark H wrote a review Oct 2016,30,Comfortable but still a work in progress,This hotel is 10 minutes from the airport and ten minutes to the Souk (both by taxi). Very security conscious with control of entry screening for cars and a metal detector to pass through to enter. Check in was horrendous - it took 45 minutes for the 5 of us. Check out was much faster!    The rooms are large specious and air conditioned. However the air con switches off when you leave the room and the room quickly goes back to 28c. There was a mini bar price list on display but no minibar. My colleague's identical room had a coffee maker but I did not. Another colleague had an iron with a U.K. plug on it! I occasionally found myself locked out of my room because the key card stopped working.    Breakfast is a bit of a trial. A huge and enjoyable buffet but trying to get tea or coffee involves a complicated system of asking a passing waiter several times until you find one who is interested in helping you. Then you have to remind them 3 times.    The pools are superb and definitely the highlight. Lots of loungers towels umbrellas poolside service.    Evening meals are Italian (the best) European (average) and Moroccan (below average).    Although the cost of the rooms were very low and great value the cost of food in the hotel was significantly over priced for what you get.    Finally and helpfully there is a small shopping mall attached to the hotel which includes a supermarket - ideal for bottled water and snacks.    This seems like a new hotel still finding it feet. If you want to lie by a pool for a week and eat simple food this is the place for you.,Date of stay: October 2016,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Ipswich, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/222MarkH222
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Tina S wrote a review Oct 2016,50,Trutly amazing place,we stayed here for 4 nights and as soon as I saw the place from my taxi the outside view looked amazing and grand. The checkin was quick took 15mins as we arrived to the hotel early 11am and they said to wait for 1 hour and the key will be ready to collect so we went to restaurant next door to the hotel near menara mall and there are 4 big restaurants..  Rooms were great size and nice balcony with pool view we went for my fiancé birthday and they arranged special chocolate cake and fruit basket free of charge in our room so that was a nice surprise for us especially for my fiancé..  pool was big size and looked very good -we were facing the small pool which was nice too.  The staff is very good but few staff members in outside area for breakfast provide slow service. inside the breakfast restaurant staff is attentive and fast to bring teas.  overall its amazing hotel with good service and polite staff.,Date of stay: October 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W3931WKtinas
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Yasmin M wrote a review Oct 2016,50,Amazing Holiday Girls Holiday,We booked the hotel last minuet as a group of 5 girls. It was a really lovely hotel but I feel what made the hotel even more special is the staff. Everyone was always so pleasant and always said good morning etc. Our first night we ate in hotel restaurant Taliouine. Jihan Zayoud the manager of the restaurant went over and beyond. She was chatty and really informative - she made our stay really lovely.    Around the swimming pool bar the two gentlemen called Mohammed were also really attentive and helpful.    The hotel was beautiful and in a great location. I am glad we choose this hotel as a large pool was needed because it was still so hot. Only down side is the small fixtures and fittings. I felt the plug sockets were poorly fitted and sometimes I was worried I would damage them.    Overall I really enjoyed my stay at the Savoy and would love to return sometime next year.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,kev133 wrote a review Oct 2016,50,Two sides to a coin,"On the back of some pretty terrible reviews of this hotel I will try apply my experience which showcases a more positive angle for this hotel. As a point of advice to Amine who responds to comments on TA posts please respond to people's feedback with something constructive which addresses their points rather than a standard ""Thank you for your feedback and we will take note"". It is better to say nothing than provide a robot-like response.    This is a large fully equipped hotel a stone throw away from the hustle and bustle of the old town. Situated in the new ""posh"" side of town it adjoins a shopping centre / food court with multiple expensive cafes and restaurants along the main street.    Room - Large sized rooms with two doubles and a balcony as standard. Everything is new modern and comfortable. Stayed in the far end of the complex which was perfect due to the lack of noise and a private albeit smaller pool and lounging area. Rooms were cleaned daily and complimentary water replenished constantly. We did have a plumbing issue on the first day where the hot water stopped intermittently for a few times during a shower which was a huge annoyance. Much better for the rest of the stay although still not a power shower.    Security - The main talking point for this hotel. Let me clarify that security DO NOT confiscate water to make you pay for expensive room service. They check your backpacks for security purposes as well as external alcohol which is forbidden. This looks common across most big resorts in Morocco and guards were always friendly throughout.    Concierge and Reception - They checked me in early (~11am) with no fuss and within ten mins. Check out was again no more than 5 mins. As we were leaving slightly later to the airport I called up reception to ask if we can check out an hour later the day before departure. They instantaneously said this will not be a problem and extended my door key pass by an hour. Whilst walking to breakfast in torrid rain one morning one of the porters gave us his umbrella and decided to walk in the rain instead. Concierge then passed us another umbrella so we wouldn't get wet as we went into town for the day.    Pool - Two large outdoor pools with plenty of spare sunbeds as well as two large indoor pools with no one using it as I went one evening. The indoor pools are open till 9pm.    Breakfast - Wide variety of options over breakfast and the waiters do try hard to provide a good service of drinks and replenishing of tables. They are generally very polite and most will smile and have a quick conversation when serving. In the four mornings here it was quiet and pleasant for three of the days. On the fourth day where it was the weekend and we arrived late for breakfast it was slightly chaotic to say the least purely due to numbers. I agree the restaurant will need to look to improving this although the staff cannot be faulted completely on this.    Location - 30 minutes walk to the old town or ten minutes taxi ride. You will HAVE to haggle but do not expect to pay more than 30-40 dirhams (3-4 Euros). Taxis to airports will be about 15 minutes and you should not pay more than 70 dirhams from the hotel.    Overall I can be fussy and pick up on issues which can be expected from any hotel especially large ones. But my review is heavily biased towards the people I met in my time there - from reception concierge security the porter that decided to get wet on my behalf the waiter who will ask about my day every morning the pianist they hire every evening in the bar who shared stories of his life as an artist in Marrakesh. It made my stay feel more human and will not hesitate to stay again.",Date of stay: October 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kev133

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Zohib wrote a review Oct 2016,50,Outstanding Service,We found the hotel to be in a brilliant location close to all the local hotspots. It had free safe parking which was great as we had hired a car to get around in.    The hotel was generally very clean and well maintained rooms were immaculate although a few minor issues were present but when a hotel is 5 star you shouldn't expect any less. For example the clothes hanger on the bathroom door was missing our room safe didn't work and we didn't receive complimentary water bottles daily amongst other menial things. But the hotel itself is fairly new so I'll give them time to iron out the details.    Nonetheless this didn't detract from the sheer magnificence of the hotel itself the pool area was outstanding and absolutely spotless shisha and cocktails by the pool were a real joy.    The hotel breakfast buffet was also great from cereals crepes to fresh omelettes they had it all every taste bud was catered for.    The real standout from my stay was Murad the guest relations manager he was a true gentleman and did everything he could to make our stay as memorable as possible. Nothing was too much for him and I'd sincerely like to thank him for his hospitality I can honestly say him and the team made the hotel worth visiting again!,Date of stay: October 2016,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zohib

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,alm2024 wrote a review Oct 2016,10,Not even close to a 5-star hotel,I give the lowest rating to this hotel as it claims to be a 5-star hotel but is nowhere close. The personnel couldn’t be less helpful and on many occasions was rude. The service was really bad and slow and the room was not cleaned properly. For example the window glass was really dirty and my used coffee mug was left in my room throughout our stay. Also empty tissue boxes were left empty and shampoos were not getting replaced. This 5-star hotel also run out of shower gel and only shampoo was available until the day we left! Last but not least they make you feel it’s all about money they even asked for a £10 deposit to provide us with a UK adaptor to charge our phones. On our way out the last day an employee at the exit stopped us to ask if we had checked-out and then he asked us to wait until he can go at the reception and check!  The only good thing about the hotel was that rooms were really big and had a good breakfast. There are plenty of hotels in that area that are probably what they claim to be so don't waste your holidays at this one.,Date of stay: October 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alm2024

That's why I rated them with 3***. The house keeping needs to do their work better. We asked several times if they want to make up our room on our second day. They forgot. We had to ask for towels then because with a toddler and using the pool people needs towels. Also they were not consistent with how many towels a room needs. Sometimes they gave us two towels for 3 people. Sometimes 2 large towels and a small one. It was weird and not how it suppose to be in such a hotel. Breakfast was very good! But too many employees that did forget a lot. Every day I needed to ask for salt and pepper. A tea spoon. Sugar and so on.    But my biggest complain is that they charged me the deposit on my creditcard! This was an amount of 5000 MAD! I emailed them but no response. Now I have to wait and see if and when I will get the amount. My booking agency is taken care of it. Not nice and not how it suppose to be!

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,samwel n wrote a review Oct 2016,30,Very Poor Service,"I am generally very much disappointed with the overall service offered during my stay: stayed from the 27 September to 4 October 2016    The Moroccan Restaurant (Talioune)    Positive:-The food is authentic and very well presented the waiters were excellent and I would like to to give special thanks to Akram and one of the lady (can’t remember the name) who went into length of explaining on how certain dishes are cooked.    Le Metropole    Negative:- The restaurant reminded me of my earlier days in a student dining hall very chaotic plates are not cleared off the table earlier on several occasions we couldn’t find a cleared table no enough waiters waited for coffee for almost 20 minutes    Positive:- the food is good and the fresh Juice waiter was very good at his work.    The Swimming Pool:    Very good swimming pool facilities however I had to wait for 30 minutes to get towels and those pool attendants’ needs to come off their mobiles phones and do their work.    The Pool bar:    Very poor service one could die from thirsty if you didn’t ask for a drink because nothing is offered.    Rooms and Room Service.    Very specious room with all the facilities one could expect from a five star hotel.  However room service was very poor I stayed there for 7 nights and my bed linen were not changed our balcony was very dusty never cleaned at all and our min bar was empty despite several requests made for bottles of water to be placed in the fridge.    The smoking policy:    This is a major obstacle and problem for non-smokers I will suggest that the hotel designate special areas for smokers  me and my friend struggled every day whether it was by the swimming pool or by the breakfast table we kept on moving places because of the smokers coming to sit next to us.    Finally the Savoy is supposed to provide five star services but I am afraid the Savoy Le Grand Hotel Marrakech does not offer that service you need to understand the concept of a five start hotel we were looking forward to a grand relaxed atmosphere at the Savoy but all we got was daily aggravation from small things that are supposed to make us happy.    You have got beautiful facilities let your service also be beautiful because that is what visitors will remember and please go through the visitors reviews you can see that all visitors are complaining of the same thing “poor service"".",Date of stay: September 2016,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/samweln

Coming from 35c heat and dust and pollution I was instantly revived and optimistic about my stay.

Lowlights included: the chavvy club music at the poolside the fact our room had faulty electrics the steep restaurant prices (far undercut by practically every surrounding eatery).

From the moment we arrived into the scented air conditioned reception until we left for the airport we received fantastic friendly service from all members of the staff nothing was to much for them. The hotel is cleaned and maintained continuously in the background security was discreet but very effective and the breakfast spread one of the best we've had in a muslim country.  The hotel was very well located just a 10-15min walk from the Medina and souks or 5 mins in a taxi. Do use the hotel recommended taxis they may be a little more expensive but after using a couple of other taxis and being let down we quickly reverted to the clean modern and safe taxis recommended by the hotel.

Location was quite good as well in terms of the airport and restaurants and the shopping mall. Now u would think everything is so fab so why was it bitter sweet! Well the staff let the place down completely. At breakfast if u want a Latte then you have to be prepared to wait for 45 mins but not just that you have to ask three different waiters. If u are lucky one of them will bring it over. Sometimes they bring you tea but forget milk other times they forget to give you a spoon. Language is also a barrier. Everything takes place at snails place so if u are used to an organised well orchestrated service then forget it. There are times when the staff give you incorrect information at reception and frankly they should all be sacked for how thick and rude they are.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Elizabeth M wrote a review Sep 2016,50,"Fantastic Hotel, lovely staff, great location",We have just returned from our 10 day holiday to Marrakech. We decided to go for this long to see all the places we wanted to see. It was important therefore that we stayed in a nice hotel in a good location.  The Savoy Le Grand Hotel was a fantastic choice. From the moment we arrived we were welcomed warmly by the reception staff. Our luggage porter called Mehdi was delightful. He spoke excellent English and was so helpful to us throughout our stay always with a smile on his face. The Concierge also called Medhi was also so helpful and helped with any queries we had in a pleasant and professional manner.  The amenities in the hotel were excellent. We opted for a suite overlooking the pool. The suite was very big with a large balcony. Spotlessly clean and towels changed every day. It was a delight to come back to at the end of an exhausting day. At night the pool and palm trees were lit up and looked magical from our balcony.  On the days we decided to stay around the pool we were given clean towels for the sun beds. It was meticulously clean and the pool attendants seemed to work non stop in keeping it so even washing the sun beds down in the evenings. The only thing that could perhaps put the icing on the cake is for waiters to come round to take drinks orders from the sunbed areas as you do have to go up to the bar to get them. Although waiters do bring them to you.Do note however it is a hotel and so the prices for drinks are more expensive.  We opted for bed and breakfast only so that we could eat out whenever we chose. The breakfasts were plentiful with lots of choice. Even freshly cooked omelettes while you waited and pancakes and waffles also freshly cooked. I particularly enjoyed the fresh fruits that were always available. On our first morning we were greeted and shown the procedure by a manager called Jawed. Every morning he was there to greet us and made us feel very special. All of the waiting staff were delightful.  Next door to the hotel is The Budda Bar. This is an amazing place that serves beautiful food. They also have entertainment.    We would thoroughly recommend this hotel. It is situated in the Hivernage district which the newer part of Marrakech. It has only been open for 1 year but all of the staff are paramount in the successful running of it as they all take the time and the trouble to make sure that the guests are treated with the utmost respect.

Had a lovely view both day and night over the main pool area a separate living area two bedrooms two bathrooms and three flatscreen televisions. Room service was very reasonably priced you will get free wifi which worked well and a buffet style breakfast is also included. Every part of this hotel was a joy to wander through with its beautiful Morrocan style decor. Check-in was a bit cumbersome check-out very swift and staff were in the main extremely courteous at all times. My only complaint is that the security staff at front of house were at times a bit heavy handed but we did our best to just shrug it off as we figured that this being a luxury hotel means that VIPs would stay and they are entitled to feel safer with having that level of security available. I would not hesitate to recommend this wonderful hotel to my family and friends when staying in Marrakech as you get a lot of bang for your buck!,Date of stay: September 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Perth, Australia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VickiR641

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Majd T wrote a review Sep 2016,50,Great experience! 100% recommendation,I've been to Marrakech many times over the past few years and continue to stay at the Savoy Le Grand Hotel year after year. It's a perfect blend of value comfort and location. Upon arriving you are greeted by a lovely Hotel Manager named Mehmet Mengilli and his welcoming team. The lobby is full of art there are comfortable couches and it's a great sense of arrival. The rooms are super nice especially the ones overlooking the pool. They have two big pools and exclusive sunbeds as well as an outstanding restaurant and a great selection at the breakfast buffet. In general it feels like a comfortable home and I love returning. Marrakech has tons of stunning new hotels but there is something about feeling at home.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Stevenn1983 wrote a review Sep 2016,10,biggest joke of a 5 star hotel ever,I will try to keep it short because that's exactly the way the hotel staff dealt with me and my wife frequently when seeking for help or asking some simple questions: the Savoy is a parody of a 5 star hotel in almost every aspect.  The staff is hugely disorganized some staff members are incredibly rude some rooms have a lot of deficiencies and the prices of room service items are very very steep (cappuccino espresso orange juice 4-5e simple salads or pastas can be around 15e of higher).  The staff is mostly a joke. We had to request 5 times to fix our locker but nobody came to the room. People at the buffet breakfast don't know what to do don't do what you ask them to do and most of the time simply ignore you (plus the food is very very bad). The concierge desk is the worst of all (except Soufianne who is great) but especially a woman called Fatima is one of the most rude persons i've ever met. She never smiles does not look at you and does not want to say sorry if her or her desk made a mistake.  I can go on and on but what's the point. I think you already got the point: this hotel is awful and has absolutely no value for money.  Across the street you can find le Meridien please go here if you don't want to experience a proper 5 star hotel.,Date of stay: September 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"The Hague, The Netherlands",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stevenn1983

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,dolapo o wrote a review Sep 2016,40,Luxury for a good price,I was to be in Marrakesh for a business conference and had booked several months in advance. The amount i paid was nothing compared to the luxury and grandness of the hotel. It was beautiful. The reception area was grand. The pool area was big and not too deep so anyone could swim. They had several pools though. You want to be near the main pool. Thats where all the fun is. The rooms were lovely and cleaning was available round the clock. I had a good view of the Atlas mountains from my room and it was quite the sight. The only downside was that you could hear planes fly over a few more times than you would like but i had no issues with the hotel.    The best part. I got into the hotel a day before my birthday. So on my birthday morning i rushed out for my conference and came back to meet a cake and birthday card waiting for me in my room. I was really pleased. I would recommend it for anyone. Its a great holiday hotel.,Date of stay: March 2016,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Lagos, Nigeria",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dolapoo108
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,The Eager Tourist wrote a review Sep 2016,40,A fine luxurious hotel,Me and my wife stayed here for 6 days and only just left today to go back to Casablanca for the final tour of our trip.    Savoy Le Grand in Marrakech is a new hotel. During our stay we were told that it was the hotel's 1 year anniversary on 18 September 2016.    Like all Savoy's across the world the service for this hotel was great. It is definitely a 5 star hotel and everything about this hotel was just fantastic. The pool area is beautiful with a bar restaurant a huge TV and a live band almost every night. They also have an indoor pool for those wanting to avoid the hot Marrakech heat during the day.    Me and my wife took a suite for our room. It was a very big suite with a large bedroom and 2 bathrooms! We also had a TV in the living room area of the suite and another TV in the bedroom. The room was beautiful with elegant decor and extremely clean.    One downside was the AC. It wasn't very powerful in either the lounge area of the bedroom area of our suite. I played around with the settings and couldn't get it to be any stronger. With a city as hot as Marrakech it might have made sense to install a lot stronger AC's. However that being said it wasn't a huge inconvenience as the AC did keep the room cool but just not as cool as we would have liked.    Another thing was that we had no mini bar in our room. When we checked out the woman at the reception asked if we used anything from the mini bar. I laughed and explained there never was a mini bar in all the 6 days we stayed. She laughed with us. I don't know if she was joking or just didn't understand what I said!    Anyway this is definitely a lovely hotel for anyone. Couples families with kids young friends or solo travellers. I would recommend this to anyone.,Date of stay: September 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Luton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/The_Eager_Tourist
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,DemiRogers wrote a review Sep 2016,40,Beautiful hotel,After reading countless hit and miss reviews I was slightly anxious about my stay at Savoy Le Grand however thankfully it succeeded ALL my expectations!  What an amazing place! The entrance is definately Grand to say the least and A beautiful aroma that is soothing and tasteful lingers in the foyer I wondered if they had the scent for sale!!    We arrived quite late in the evening so it was quiet and check in took no longer than 10 minutes.I did not have to give my card and paid the hotel taxes in cash avoiding any extra charges being made.  There is a cash machine to the right of the reception desk which was extremely convenient.    A kind young man took us to our room he offered to have our bags brought up separately but we insisted we could take them ourselves.  As we walked through the hotel to our room we caught a glimpse of the extraordinary pool such a beautiful setting in the evening with a live band situated besides one of the restaurants. We saw people enjoying drinks and shisha pipes.    Almost at our room we encountered a second pool (this place is huge!!) a little smaller but equally as nice and plenty of sunbeds.    We arrived at our room which was just the picture a HUGE queen sized bed with plenty of cushions awaited us! Our balcony overlooked the pool (I think all rooms do from what I saw) there were also curtains on the balcony which came in handy if you wanted more privacy and shade from the midday sun.    The minibar was empty thank goodness however there were 2 complimentary bottles of water which if drunken were replenished each day. The bathroom came with plenty of toiletries soaps shampoo towels and even a shower cap!    By the time we had settled in it was fairly late and the in house Italian restaurant was closed so we ventured outside and right next door to a restaurant called Elite the freshly baked pizza was lovely and reasonably priced. You also get a perfect view of the water fountain show! However a dancing water fountain to the sound of Celine Dion really wasn't our thing but something to look at!    The Menara Mall is also right next door in fact you can walk into the Mall via the hotel  I believe this whole complex is connected.    With regards to the bag checking yes the door men/ woman did do this every time you re-entered the hotel however they ARE NOT stopping you from bringing things in (This was one of my worries after reading other reviews). We went to the local Carrefour in the Mall and brung back some snacks and drinks. The only thing you are not allowed to bring in is alcohol.    The buffet breakfast was truly out of this world yes the scrambled eggs did look a bit runny but there is a counter where fresh omlettes and fried eggs are made to order. There is also a chef making fresh crepes and waffles and he even makes mini ones for children. There was definately something for everyone! Fresh pastries cakes hams and cheeses yoghurt granola fruit a huge selection of breads the list goes on!! I was spoilt for choice everyday!  The staff in the restaurant were very attentive filling our cups with fresh juice as we sat down and even insisting on getting us salt and pepper from a table right next to us! Contrary to other reviews i thought the violinist was a nice touch he is really talented!    A handful of staff cleaned the pools and sun beds every morning. And yes the pool is slightly shallow (120cm) but this was deep enough to swim. On one of the days a gentleman walked around the pool and offered everyone a piece of what looked like leftover watermelon from the buffet nice touch.    A taxi into the old town/ main square should cost 30dirham before 8.30pm and 50dihram after no more than this. You tell them that is how much you want to pay before you get in and they will agree. The journey is 5-10mins depending on the traffic. You will find plenty of taxis pulling up outside the hotel.    If you dont wish to venture into the old town/souks there are plenty of restaurants close to the hotel just walk out turn turn left and there is something for everyone.    Check out ran smoothly the day before you are due to check out a slip arrives under your door asking to settle the bill then as opposed to being delayed on the day. I opted for a late checkout up to 4pm which was an extra 200dihram (20euros)    All in all i found the whole hotel experience very satisfying and would stay here again should i return to Marrakech.,Date of stay: September 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DemiRogers
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Karen R wrote a review Sep 2016,50,FIVE NIGHTER......HALF BOARD,Booked this through fleetway travel. Ihad emailed the hotel ages before and asked for a transfer from the airport to hotel. After realizing that transfers were included and no email address to be found later on I spent twenty minutes waiting on the telephone to cancel the transfer. On arrival outside there was a driver with a fleetway board who told us we needed a voucher but he said all will be well could get a copy of transfer booking at hotel ....told us to wait as he was waiting for two more couples. We saw the driver from the hotel...out of politeness went to check who he was waiting for as he had our names on it I told him we had cancelled so as not to keep him waiting. The two drives then had a conversation and we were told by the fleetway driver to go with hotel driver...we said we had cancelled and had free transfer...that's ok you come !. Yes you guessed it ...no record of cancellation at concierge and there argument was ...well you got in it and have to say were made to look like liars which were not....so don't phone hotel before for anything a waste of time and money.  That was the sour taste....and now for the sweetness;  A serene oasis of calm and serenity.Check in was effortless shown straight to our room which was beautiful. The Queen sized bed was extremely comfy the television showed a great variety of films on Dubai one channel and the room was a fabulous size.  The grounds were amazing and the staff worked extremely hard in keeping these in prestine condition as they did the pools.  A little information regarding half board at reception would have been appreciated most people obviously on b and b.The restaurant was actually closed four ot of our five nights but you were allowed to eat in the morrocan or Italian restaurant on their half board menu...so a touch of a la carte most evenings which is bizarre but fab. Don't panic if you have to sign the bill for the set price...all good.  Breakfast was lovely great omelette every morning and yes you maybe a spoon missing or cup or knife and fork but they are happy staff and youre on holiday just smile and ask...they deliver.  I felt very secure within the hotel...they were front and back and sides..a shame you couldn't bring in just a bottle of wine to enjoy on your balcony and enjoy the ambience and its a shame that the prices inside the hotel for the same were so expensive. Everybody walked out in the evening..I am not tight but with Carrefour next door and the wine so much cheaper it would leave a bad taste on principal just wouldn't do it.  Found a lovely restaurant up on the right handside fountain outside where they had happy hour six til nine where you could sit and enjoy a morrocan beer or two.  All in all we had a fab time at a fab hotel and the morrocan experience was a delight.,Date of stay: September 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Kirkby-in-Ashfield, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/418karenr
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Bhav B wrote a review Sep 2016,50,Beautiful hotel but overall poor service!,Absolutely gorgeous and lavish hotel with very comfortable rooms. However I must say the service by waiters are very poor. Be ready to wait for an hour or so after you have ordered something. I speak both English and French but most staff could not communicate in neither of them which is very frustrating. Most of them pretend not to understand you so that they don't have to the work. Good breakfast served (same thing everyday) but be mindful of the dates as there are little white worms in them and I was told by the guest relations manager that this is normal. Flies in the open pots yogurts.  Buffet dinner was stopped in the middle of my holiday and was given short menu with nothing for vegetarians. Plenty of restaurants around the hotel going half board is pointless.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Mister P wrote a review Sep 2016,30,Large hotel with potential - but please train your staff!,FIrst time in Morocco for a friend`s wedding and we booked what appeared to be something comparable to the Four Seasons (purporting to be 5 star) at 1/3 of the price - however as is usually the case you get what you pay for.    The bad:    Now I am not an unrealistic man so I was expecting to make allowances but the staff really were not trained to a suitable level - the characters at the front desk during check-in displayed quite some attitude. That after initially claiming we had no booking and eventually being urged to return our passports after chatting idly to each other for some 20 minutes. They however were veritable maestros in comparison to the waiting staff who could be completely overloaded with an order for a tea AND a coffee (In both French and English). A taxi would be promised by the concierge although it would never turn up and despite the urging of security it`s much easier to simply hail your own from the street.    The good:    The rooms were spacious as were the beds the breakfast buffet was comprehensive the 2 pool areas were large and with plenty of decent sunbeds. The bathroom was also solid and modern and everything seemed clean and in good order. The buddha bar which is part of the hotel building is decently lively and provided some late night entertainment.    In summary: Probably somewhere approaching 3.5-4 star in reality and with service that requires a slower pace of life or just call it patience. I would say stay if the price was right.,Date of stay: September 2016,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Basel, Switzerland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/misterp2015

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Anass C wrote a review Sep 2016,30,Under expectations but gloabbly ok,It was the first time at this hotel first part of our honeymoon my wife and I. I had high expectations but my disappointment started even before we arrived when I tried to call the hotel to ask whether it’s possible to decorate the room as a wedding night… but no real answer just some “I will transfer your call…” and finally no answer after 5 minutes waiting… Anyway I complained once arrived and they upgraded our room which was a nice surprise. We have been told that the breakfast ends at 11am. We arrived around 10:30 surprise… The breakfast finishes actually at 10:30 so we have been invited to go to a smaller restaurant… It was ok but we prefer the first one.  Another annoying point if you dial 700 to reach the reception they never answer your call.  The checkout was a bit painful I had to wait around 10 minutes and finally I have been told that I was in the wrong queue… I insisted to make the checkout where I was and they accepted.  In order to deserve its 5 stars the hotel has to put more staff at the reception desk (for example to answer the calls and to make the checkout quicker) and ask each one to put a smile on his face  Extending the breakfast time to 11am would be nice as people come to such hotel for holiday not for business.  A part from this we enjoyed our stay we have been warmly received by Oussama and Mourad very nice persons. They arranged a surprise for our wedding which was a wonderful thing!

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Adeoye Gabriel A wrote a review Sep 2016,50,Outstanding hotel with outstanding customer service.,This hotel was simply magnificent. With a stunning décor and every amenity one could wish for. The breakfast which was included was outstanding. The food was simply brilliant!! There were impromptu performances through the breakfast hall by Berber musicians and delicious Moroccan tea being served throughout.  The concierge was fantastic and arranged a cake for my fiancé and I simply because I mentioned at check-in that this was an anniversary trip. This was done completely free of charge and without me even requesting it in what was a lovely gesture from the hotel. They even phones me to let me know so that it would be a surprise for her.  The concierge also helped us arrange all of our taxis at the appropriate rate which was often much lower that what we had been quoted elsewhere. This was especially useful when we went to the water park on our last day a little way out of town as it meant we did not spend a lot on taxis at all! They even stored our bags for us for most of the day after we had checked out so we were free to go out and enjoy our last day in Marrakech.  The reception was equally brilliant arranging late checkout at no extra cost and when we were mistakenly charged for extras removing these without any hesitation and apologising for the oversight.  The room was breathtaking and whenever we called for room service this was immediate. The mall and mini-mart connected to the hotel kept us well stocked throughout and gave us lots of places to eat and a conveniently located bank and bureau de change next door.    The main outdoor pool (we had 2 to choose from - a quiet one and the main one where music was played) was beautiful and had its own waterfall and 2 bars. Obviously the sunshine helped in this regard as it was lovely to lie down in the heat but this place was so lovely it would have been equally as amazing in the dead of winter. To this end in the spa there were 2 heated pools and a Jacuzzi.  The spa treatments were a little expensive for us but we arranged to go to a hamaam in the medina and the spa itself was stunning.  I literally have nothing bad to say about this place and I will absolutely be going back as soon as possible.

Really created a nice welcoming ambience !  We got to our room which was very nice but I have to say the coffee maker wasn't working or maybe the instructions on how to get it to work wasn't very clear so rang up reception about it . As we were waiting they hadn't yet given us a cot which we requested for when we booked it and then the bathroom door suddenly got jammed and we couldn't get into the bathroom! We felt like a beautiful hotel like this had so many downfalls upon arrival so went to ring up reception and the telephone stopped working ! We were rather tired from travelling so this was definitely not called for . In the end I had to personally leave my kids 3 n 18m twins with my husband n go here myself to say what the issues were but then it was all rectified . Apart from this we had a wonderful stay and the menara mall next door made it very convenient for us with the kids entertainment food etc ! Would love to visit again ! Loved it there !

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Matt5665 wrote a review Sep 2016,30,Let down by the easy things,There is two types of staff at this hotel: those who are willing to go above and beyond which is great; and the second type who give you a foul look that you've interrupted them playing Angry Birds on their phone which they've been doing for the last hour. Unfortunately the second type are the ones who are actually meant to help you (ie front line) whereas the friendly ones are more people like cleaners etc.    The rooms are massive and we got a free upgrade which was most appreciated.    The pool I found too shallow though to really enjoy it seems more suited for kids.    The buffet breakfast could have been awesome but they insisted on leaving the top off of metal containers to warm the sausages etc. Meaning it was old cold! Seriously that is basic stuff. Well that along with not serving curdled milk with cereal which they did one morning.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Trisha S wrote a review Sep 2016,30,Beautiful but not welcome,Stayed here as a young Irish couple for 2 days. We were assured at check in we would be charged when we check out and the pre authorization was just a security thing. They put 1500 extra dirhams than the actual amount our booking was and said this was incase we wanted extras. We taught fine because they said the money would not come out and we knew we would not be getting extras. Low and behold the money had came out.  Checking out they tryed to charge us for mini bar fees even though the mini bar had been empty throughout our stay. 5 minutes later we are told it was for room service which we did not use and told them to check the phone calls because we never used the phone to even avail of that. Waiting now for the money to be put back in to my account.  The place is beautiful and the rooms are great . A great choice at breakfast!

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,SE18Dweller wrote a review Sep 2016,30,"Nice hotel, but let down by so many small things","Let me start out by saying that the hotel is nice (although most of the budget seems to have gone on the reception) kept in good order cleaned well staffed by friendly people and we enjoyed our stay. Beneath that though there are so many things that could be improved with a little effort that would make this hotel much much better than 'good' (see below if you want to know). I'm still not sure it can honestly say it's a 5* hotel. It's a 4* with service problems.    We stayed in a de-luxe pool view room which was large with a big comfy bed. The wifi we found to be patchy (best reception was sat on the toilet or right by the window). The fridge was an OK size and had plenty of space to put your own stuff given there were no mini-bar items in it.    It's less than 10 mins from the airport so we'd get a cab. We booked independent transfers but it would have been cheaper and more flexible (particularly at departure time) to get a taxi. It should be no more than 30 dhirams from the airport based on other journeys we did.    The hotel is a relaxed 15 mins walk to the Medina. It's along a main highway so it's busy and well lit for a walk back at night. It's also beside the Menara mall which is short on shops at the moment but there is a big Carrefour in it so makes life easier to get water snacks etc.    The reasons we don't think this is a 5* are immediately below with the 'big 3' detailed further below those.  - Balcony door latch was upside down so gravity meant it unlocked naturally. Fine if no one can get near your balcony but we had a corner room so our neighbour's balcony could easily have been used as access  - No kettle and only one cup for a coffee machine which didn't work.  - There was nothing in the fridge not even the 2 free waters and no complementary biscuits nuts or crisps in the room which would have been nice.  - There was a plate of fruit and small sweets brought to us just as we were heading out to dinner. It should have been in the room when we got there or brought moments later.  - The shower wasn't really powerful enough and some days the temp went hot to cold to hot then ok.    We'd probably stay closer to the Medina if we go back but this hotel is good for travellers who want an easy stay.    So to our frustrations which can be grouped in to check-in/out breakfast and pool. I share these in the spirit of openness and as much in the hope that the hotel will read them and take them on board.    Check-in/out  Whilst the welcome was nice the process of checking in took way too long. They also didn't offer us any kind of welcome. I asked if they could change a 200 dhiram note so I could tip the bell hop but was told that wasn't possible. I tried the concierge and the bar. The answer was the same which is odd considering there was a cash till in full view at one of them. It was only at check-out that I saw the drawers of notes they also had and plenty were smaller than a 200. It's not possible actually means ""we won't"".    When we came to check out there were 3 people behind the desk all of whom were being seen. 2 guests left within a couple of minutes but rather than serve us the staff disappeared. We eventually got served but the lady was obviously new as she asked her colleagues several questions. There was no 'good morning did you enjoy your stay'. In fact there were no pleasantries at all. We were asked if we had anything from the mini bar. I said that there was nothing to have from the mini-bar. I was then asked to write that down on a blank piece of paper and sign to confirm. All in all it took around 15 minutes to check out of a pre-paid room. Without a queue that's just not acceptable.    Breakfast  The service was so inconsistent. Tables weren't laid consistently. There would be say 2 settings but one would be missing a cup there would only be 1 knife. Mostly there were no tea spoons. That said most days we had to get someone's attention to get us a tea or coffee. Some days they offered us orange juice yet on others they didn't. It was just random each day which just says the training isn't consistent or isn't kept on top of.    Used plates wouldn't be cleared once used. I saw one lady on one day stand up and move to the far side of her table to find space for the plate she'd just used. And all of this was not due to a shortage of staff. I counted 10+ staff most days in the dining room which was enough for the number of guests.    Whilst the food was plentiful in choice at the same time it wasn't. There were genuinely some days when we just didn't fancy any of it and we're not fussy eaters. The hot food was often luke warm because the lids were left off. The plates often ran out on one section so you had to walk to the other to get one. Just lots of little things that could be so easily fixed and would elevate the hotel. It would be so simple to make everyone get a consistent experience every day: welcome every guest note their room escort them to a table ensure they're offered tea/coffee/juice clear the tables. Easy.    Pool  There is a total lack of staff around the smaller pool which is where we spent our days. The main pool had plenty of beds but just doesn't need the loud music all day. It was a mix of dance or other genre as well so not even relaxing music. There was no one bringing cold flannels around. No one coming round offering drinks (with the temp over 40 degrees they'd have made a killing at the bar each day). There's only 1 hut giving out pool towels which was away from all the rooms on the far side of the main pool which put it a long way from the smaller pool. You also got given a little card per guest for a towel so you had to walk back to the hut to retrieve them at the end of each day. Either that or keep the same sweaty towel for the following day. I've come across similar systems in other hotels but this was worse because of the location of the hut and seemed oddly strict considering you could wander in and sit down at breakfast without anyone noting your room number.    Having written all that down I can probably summarise it as....requires improved processes better training and more attentive staff. However please don't be put off by this. It could just be our experience (however one could argue that no one should experience anything differently to other guests!). It is a nice hotel that I want to rate more highly but I just can't",Date of stay: September 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SE18Dweller

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,nazirasabrena wrote a review Sep 2016,40,Needs some improvement,Unless this hotel improves the way guests are checked in along with how payments are made and overall customer service is provided I wouldn't stay here again.    Checking into the hotel took quite sometime but I've no idea why as I travelled alone and there was nobody being served before me.    I handed my card over straight away to pay for my booking but was informed that payment is taken on the last day. Instead a copy of my card details were allegedly taken for security reasons.    My room was clean and spacious. I was also happy it looked like the professional pics taken alongside the ones taken by previous guests.    I requested a room at the back of the hotel so the noise from the pool at the front and the live music playing would not disturb me.    There's plenty of food to choose from in the main buffet restaurant. I stuck to fresh omelettes which are made to order at one of the cooking stations. Although there are separate spoons for the different ingredients guests can choose from there were occasions when one spoon was used for more than one ingredient.    If anyone is a strict vegetarian or is allergic to dairy products then you should perhaps avoid this or at least make sure that different spoons are being used as this is a health and safety risk.    The service is quite bad in the buffet restaurant. Half way through my stay tea spoons were missing from most of the tables.    I made the mistake of letting one of the waiters get me a pot of tea. In the time it took me to wait for my omelette to be cooked and for me to choose what else I wanted to eat my pot of tea had ended up on someone else's table. I wasn't happy at all. I was quite capable of getting my own tea and leaving it on the table which also let other guests know the table was occupied. The staff are so slow that you honestly are better off getting your own hot drinks- trust me.    The hot food on display isn't hot. It's all cold. I discovered a microwave in the corner of the restaurant and used this for my next 5 mornings. There's no way I would have eaten anything else if there was no microwave. I think it's a joke that guests need to use the microwave when the food should be hot. Again it's a health issue. The scrambled eggs were very wet. I didn't eat them at all. It looked like clotted vomit on a metallic tray.    The staff in the reception area of the hotel were mostly friendly and I had no issues with them. Whenever I needed to order a taxi or asked for a recommendation for somewhere to eat I was always helped.    The security checks were not a waste of time and are not pointless. With so many places being attacked and places being threatened with attacks I was pleased to see such tight security. I felt very safe.    Your bags are checked for common sense reasons and I can assure you that it has nothing to do with the hotel wanting people to spend money on drinks and snacks that I did feel were quite expensive.    I went to the super market next door to the hotel everyday and bought soft drinks water juice and crisps. My bags were checked. Once it was established I had nothing but drinks and snacks on me I was allowed into the hotel. I sat in reception at various times of the day and night. I never once saw any guest not allowed into the hotel with any food drinks or snacks. If guests were stopped then there must have been a valid reason.    The payment for the hotel needs to be better organised. 24 hours after I checked in I was shocked that payment for my stay was pending as I had been told no money is taken till the day I check out.    I was repeatedly told that no money had left my account even though I called customer services and checked online where you could clearly see money was pending.    Previous guests had stated that they had been charged twice so I was worried the same would happen to me and that I would go through hell to get my money back.    The simple solution is to insist you pay when you check in or pay at the time of making your reservation to ensure you don't have any issues. If you use anything such as room service or the spa etc pay right away and settle the bill. Problem solved.    The hotel is beautiful and it's perfectly located in my opinion but the issues I had and that other guests have also had have put me off. I would revisit Marrakech but will stay somewhere else unless these issues are laid to rest.    One review I read stated that the hotel ripped them off for a taxi to the airport. I travelled by myself and never had anyone to split the bill with. I was charged 70 Moroccan Dirhams for a taxi to the airport on the day of my departure. This is just a few £'s in sterling. I'm sorry but I don't understand what the huge fuss is about. For a family travelling to the airport just split the bill or hail your own taxi. I think people should research more about the daily costs they will incur while abroad before they rush to go on holiday.    Everywhere else I went by taxi I paid between 20 and 30 Moroccan Dirhams which I was fine with.    A visit to the Buddha Bar is recommended. I also enjoyed the food and desert at Elite which is immediately around the corner. I also ate at Bella Italia Mc D's and a few other places.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Shaza66 wrote a review Sep 2016,40,Almost...,Our stay here was unexpected to say the least. We'd been in a lovely riad in the mdina for our three day trip before I came down with dysentery and was rushed to Marrakech Hospital for 3 days of drips and drugs (another story for another website). In the meantime we'd missed our flights back to UK and had nowhere to stay so my DH booked this hotel near the hospital for a very good rate. He explained my situation to the concierge who kindly upgraded us due to my ordeal. Our insurance co couldn't get us a flight for 3 days so we stayed here for a completely unplanned recuperation for 3 nights. For the rest and chill that I needed it was perfect. A clean (I mean CLEAN) hotel with more cleaners than guests. The rooms are exquisite and well appointed. The guests are very cool tanned and lean smoking sheesha (and while not smiling a lot looking very rich).    The breakfast buffet is out of this world. They are getting there with 5 star customer service but I do sympathise with another reviewer here who spoke of lots of waiters inexplicably arguing enthusiastically in Arabic while she sat waiting for her coffee.    I wish they didn't charge nearly £5 for a can of Coke and think it a little obscene that you have to buy water at £4 (you are searched lest you try to smuggle any of your own in) in a country where you can't drink the water. (PLEASE DON'T DRINK THE WATER 😬)    It is so nearly 5* in many respects - but not all.,Date of stay: August 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Epsom, England, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shaza66

We were a little hesitant before coming as the reviews are so mixed some people love it and others seem to have had a bad experience. However our stay was perfect. Each and every staff member we spoke to over our week stay were so pleasant from check in to breakfast to drinks at the bar to random staff we met in the lift!  The location is ideal with loads of restaurants beside it and a taxi to old and new town costing around 4euro.  Every day at the pool a staff member walks around offering fruit and one day a manager was with him asking how our stay has been so far. The rooms were cleaned every day even some days when we headed out quite late. The breakfast is lovely with quite a large selection.

Perfect location to all sights outstanding service from front desk and concierge. We were upgraded to a suite on arrival. The rooms and bathrooms are top quality.  The pool area is great too with plenty of beds and umbrellas.  Only issues are with service- I think they are still learning and will improve with time ( not quite in the outstanding rating of turkey or Dubai) but good any way. Also if you are half board you may get bored with the food as the menu in the 2 restaurants for dinner do not change. Drink prices are extortionate and they do not allow drinks to be brought in to the hotel including water which is also quite expensive. In 40+ temperatures you need plenty of hydration.  Special mention to Aasma in the restaurant - she is very professional and helpful.

First of all there is no such thing as customer service. Everyone is downright rude. Its such a shame as the facilities are beautiful but dont let this lure you in and heres why:    1. Checkin took over an hour of complete incompetance.  2. Asked for a pool towel and told to get two cards which were not supplied at checkin - this took 25 mins.  3. Asked for an extra cup for coffee - witnessed the maid spitting in the cup to clean it ... i couldnt believe what i was seeing.  4. Asked the concierge where marrakech was only to be eye rolled and told we were in marrakesh... any imbescile would understand means the city centre.  5. Last night had to endure drums and screatching flute noise right outside the room with drummers etc playing their music outside (on the premises of the hotel) until 4am.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,ALamby wrote a review Aug 2016,20,All around weird experience...,The hotel was in theory nice one of the restaurants (Italian) was nice the rooms were comfy etc. but overall many more negatives than positives - the whole place had very strange vibe and we were actually quite relieved to leave in the end.    I should say that I think the hotel is fairly new so possibly some teething issues and we did go in low season so probably a bit strange with that as well. In any case negatives we experienced:  - slightly out of the way of everything  - excessive and probably highly ineffective bag search every time you go into the hotel even if you've clearly just been to the supermarket next door  - drilling/general building work to the gym until gone midnight (very loud could not sleep)  - on calling to complain about the drilling phone was never answered and continually went to a message in french (which I cannot understand as I do not speak french) - I don't really understnd why an international hotel would only have a busy message in french  - hotel reception staff always seemed extremely enthused with trying to help in any way  - hotel concierge: we asked them to check our transfer time to the airport because we thought it was too close was assured it was okay. We told them we would be waiting by the pool. We go at the arranged time to the concierge to see if our transfer was there yet to be told it waited 45 minutes for us and then left.... We were in the hotel the entire time and no effort was made to find us despite them knowing where we were. Almost missed flight because of this.  - cleaners seemed to do a very poor attempt on daily cleaning of the room - on one day we even came back to find our pillows on the floor  - hotel bars are quite pricey (although I assume standard for a hotel bar in a Muslim country)  - Jacuzzi and spa are extra which I believe is quite odd for a 5*    Pros:  - waiters in the Italian restaurant were fantastic  - got a free room upgrade  - beds/rooms in general are comfortable  - pool is huge although a bit cold,Date of stay: June 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alamby2018
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Laura M wrote a review Aug 2016,10,5 star mirage...,Great building and facilities. Check-in was quick and friendly and the woman who met us at reception was great. Negatives....Where to begin.... the bag search on entry seemed a little extreme but after 10 times or so it just becomes annoying. This was to enforce a ban on all food and drink entering the hotel from outside. When you have tourists and children in 40 degree heat it becomes dangerous and petty to confiscate half a bottle of water at the door. Breakfast was a joke. 10 staff hanging around doing nothing but argue while guests are without coffee napkins and cutlery. One morning after waiting 15 minutes for someone to attend to us I went to the coffee bar myself to ask for coffee and was rudely told to go to my seat. On the last day of our stay a violin player had been hired to play during breakfast with no improvement in service which just made the situation seem even more ridiculous. We were told on the first morning by a manager to hurry up and put something on a sunlounger before they were all gone. The opposite to most hotel policies. In fact every day we could not use any of the many empty sunlounger as someone had claimed them for the day. I felt neither comfortable or safe here there were all night parties on our floor and I even met a strange man who refused to speak to me hanging around outside our room door on one occasion. The main problem with this hotel seems to be lack of staff training and ridiculous hotel policies that change from one day to the next.,Date of stay: August 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Bilbao, Spain",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lem9985

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,ZainabV wrote a review Aug 2016,40,Honest review,Currently typing from this hotel check in took some time because the room wasn't ready but the staff were very friendly the hotel had a calm atmosphere so the wait wasn't a problem. We arrived to the room but there was a slight issue with plumbing in the bathroom and my family were spread out on different floors however we contacted the management and they resolved the issue professionally offering us a free spa experience or moving to a suite. We chose the room change and now my family are much closer together very convenient.    During my week stay I found that the service in savoy was amazing and the staff were friendly. The hotel was very clean.    Breakfast was delicious but it may not cater for everyone it is not full English more French just make sure you go the larger breakfast buffet near the larger pool as there is a more food selection. The best part about breakfast was the violinist who was exceptional.    There is a bit of language barrier so we couldn't ask much the same goes for the entire country. Menus and general signs are all in French. Be prepared and learn French before you go to Morocco. But most of savoy's staff will understand what you mean.    But I must take this chance and say I wouldn't return to Morocco it's not fit for English tourist anyway. However if you do take part in any excursions you'll find your experience much better: camel riding quad biking!!! Atlas mounting hiking/ scenic views. The night life if amazing and Moroccan food is very good. Contact the hotel concierge for this.    This hotel is in the most ideal location as it is situated behind a shopping mall with restaurants lining the front the hotel has a private entrance/exit to the mall. There're fountain shows at night right beside this hotel (30 seconds walk!!). If you're coming to Marrakech I recommend choosing to stay at savoy.    P.s the spa is not included in the hotel price. You must pay 200 dirhams for the sauna and jacuzzi (1 hour and 30 mins only) and if you want a massage/Hammam this would cost extra. Additionally hotel tax is not per room here you are charged per person.

The gym rooms and both of the restaurants the moroccan and the italian all was just perfect for our holidays in marrakech.,Date of stay: August 2016,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Derby, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cherry-K30

Breakfast is pretty chaotic the guys at the poolbar constantly forget to clean the tables the waiters at the hotel bar differ a lot in quality the front desk made terrible mistakes and the concierge is helpful but far too nonchalant for a hotel this level.  The pool in the middle is great and the Morroccan restaurant serves lovely food much better than the Italian restaurant which is way too expensive.

This was one of my best experiences ever this was a brand new fresh hotel in lovely oriental modern design. Great location. But what really made our stay the best was the staff they were very service minded and gave both professional service and personal service. They were all so friendly and helpful and especially Mehdi he made our stay in Marrakech amazing because of all the good places he sent us to. He set up an amazing plan for us everything from cooking class to Spa and the hottest restaurants in Marrakech he did put a lot of effort to help us book everything. Without all his good recommendations and help I don't think our stay would of been the same.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,holiday102 wrote a review Aug 2016,50,Magnificent,From the get go this hotel ticked all the boxes. I travelled from Ireland with my boyfriend for a short 4 day holiday in the beautiful marrakech. When we arrived at the hotel we where greeted by a bell boy who took our bags and headed for the reception. Check in was quick and painless and we where then guided to our Suite. We got a brilliant deal on the suite so we went with it! What a fabulous room living area bedroom with a huge bed  bathroom with a walk in  Shower and jaccuzi bath walk in wardrobe and a double balcony with 2 chairs 2 tables and 2 sun beds  We had the luxury of a pool view on the 3rd floor! The pool is definitely in my top 3 pools! With water sun beds to get out of the scorching 40 degree heat the white leather sun beds under umbrellas with head cushions and each bed was accompanied by a towel( no need to bring towels with you). YES the food /drink/ Shisha is more expensive in the hotel but not my much - 5-10  Dirhams. Breakfast had a huge variety in a gorgeous room . Pool bar looking down over the pool. Spa services are amazing  had a lovely 30 minute massage while my boyfriend used the gym! Our flight home wasn't until 8pm and upon a simple request we where granted a late checkout. 5 stars from me! Connected to a strip of restraints (if staying here make sure to go to the Buddha bar next door absolutely amazing ) the hotel is connected to the menera mall and is 5 minute drive from  The markets and the medina  beware of taxi drivers not turning on the metre! But if  You order a taxi from reception they will give you a set price of about 25-30 Dirham (2.50-€3)  All in all it was a fantastic trip,Date of stay: August 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/holiday9797

Actually I lack words with which to express my unforgetfull experience. It begins from the time I get in the hotel till my check out. I was treated as a prince or a star. Wherever I go all the staff offer their services and welcome me with a large smile and do their best to make my stay nice.  The room is very clean and quiet . What I liked the most is the pool area and the varied buffet breakfast with a large choice of local and international specialities.  When I was taking my breakfast the Manager approched me and greeted me and asked me about my stay and whether I need some thing .

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Christina M wrote a review Jul 2016,40,Good hotel and value,Stayed here with our 3 kids. Thought it was pretty good hotel for the money. Check-in went fast with no problems. Bell boy for both check-in and check-out was fast. Nice pools. Calling front desk and or house keeping from room was a bit frustrating as they would never pick up. Only ate at the onsite breakfast which was pretty large offering and good. Ate at the restaurants in the mall which were pretty tasty and also shopped at the attached Carrefour supermarket. That was convenient. Security let me bring back only 1 small bottle of water.    Room was clean nice size and comfy bed.    We hired a private guide via TA and they did not allow him inside the hotel even though front desk people told me he would be allowed inside so we were waiting for him in the lobby for 30 minutes while all the time he was outside in the parking lot waiting for us because the security at the front of hotel would not let him in and he called the hotel several times asking for us and they never told me while we were sitting in the lobby waiting. That was irritating!

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Sid K wrote a review Jul 2016,30,Oui Oui for French speakers but No No for everyone else...,"Booked this hotel over 3 months ago & was very excited as was the wife. The actual holiday was amazing as were the hotel facilities second to none. It was just a real shame that the customer service was dreadful.    The pro's for this hotel include the great location right next to a shopping mall with loads of food places & a mini souk inside. Both swimming pools are well maintained we both loved the indoor pool (which wasn't as packed with people). Lastly the in-house hammam offered was a nice little treat & relatively cheap.    Moving onto the con's...firstly no one likes being ripped off that is what Mr O Ghafari at reception tried to do as soon as I got to the hotel. Despite seeing a wad of documents I placed in front of him with Expedia's name/logo clearly sighted he asked for my debit card & sneakily tried to charge me for the whole booking again?! Shocking behaivour only when I questioned him he realised he got caught red handed & promised to sort us out a ""nice room"". Then comes the whole issue of only being able to check-in between 2:30-3:30pm how ridiculous is that! Took us an additional 40mins anyway. The wi-fi in the room was hit & miss we were told that this was due to it being ""busy season so lots of guests using the wifi at same time"" hmmm. We made a simple request to have an extra bottle of water (small) but was refused this. They advised us to use room service or purchase from supermarket next door (which was fine we did this a couple of days without any fuss). Then 2days prior to our return apparently the Director of the hotel changed the rule 'no food/beverages from outside allowed to be brought into the premises'. Guests were not informed of this at all until they were stopped by hotel security at the entrance. Basically underhand tactics to get you to use room service thus spend more. We went to make a complaint to the reception about this but no one could understand nor provide a clear explanation. The female staff at the reception desk are all pretty but at the same time pretty damn useless. Last but not least despite my wife calling reception half an hour earlier to get a bellboy to help take down our suitcases when checking out no one actually came which meant we had to take our own suitcases down. My guess is that female receptionist didn't bother passing message onto one of the bellboys. Not a great service especially if you've paid for this.    It's really a shame about the poor customer service to be honest as the holiday & our 10 days in Marrakech was awesome (we did the Atlas Mountains Dirt buggy Oasiria waterpark Souk tour & Jardin Majorelle). My wife and I (& some other English speaking guests there) soon realised that the hotel staff only really cared if you were a French national or spoke French. English being their 4th language should definitely NOT have an impact on the quality of the service they provide because they're a 5 star Hotel so one would & should expect a 5 star service. Special praise should be made to Rachid (bellboy) Hicham (bellboy) and Rachid (concierge) as they were always very helpful polite & friendly to us.    I'm guessing I'm going to get a standard response to this review from Amine Lamnyi which I believe highlights my point above i.e. no one is actually listening to its customers.

The hotel has a lot going for itself (the location the proximity to a mall etc). I love love love the pool(s) very Miami vibe with music playing in the background shisha.. I will also say they were very accommodating with regards to the newborn baby. Few complaints that I hope the hotel management iron out:    1. The check-in was disastrous. It took us a good hour to get sorted. Once we handed all our passports we were told to ""grab some team and relax"". Already preparing us that this was going to be a lenghty process.    2. Morning breakfast. The spread was great although it was impossible to get the attention of the staff for a simple cup of coffee. We asked 3 different waiters until one of us decided to just walk over to the coffee stand and demand for a cup of coffee.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,pearldrop22 wrote a review Jul 2016,20,Don't expect much,I have just come back from a holiday with my friends after staying at Savoy le grand in Marrakech. We arrived at around 12 and were told we could not check in till 3pm. We decided to go to the mall next door and when we came back at 1.30 we were able to check in. It then took a while for our luggage to arrive to the room and we soon learned that service for everything would be slow. We were on a half board basis and were given 2 restaurant options the Morrocan and Italian. The Morrocan restaurant was ok but food was not great. The Italian restaurant food was nice but the service was terrible on all 5 days we visited and the manager was extremely rude every time. There was never any sorbet even though it said so on the menu which meant me being a vegetarian had to always miss out on dessert. 1 night 2 of my friends went to the restaurant before the other 2 of us and asked for a table for 4 but he made us sit separately despite there being plenty of tables free. When paying the bill the change takes over half an hour to come back and the menu for lunch and dinner is the same. I really recommend you don't go for half board due to the lack of food options. As for housekeeping the room was never cleaned on time we would often come back in evening to find the room was yet to be cleaned. Something was always missing wether it be towels or water or something. 1 evening there were no towels and me and my friend needed to have a shower to go out. I asked the cleaner for a towel as she was outside the room she said 5 minutes. 20 minutes later I asked again and she said she was still cleaning rooms and would be a while. I told her that I was getting late and needed to have a shower. I said she should have put 1 in when cleaning the room and if she could go get me 1 as I am waiting. I was horrified that she then thought it acceptable to go in someone else's room and get theirs. Ofcorse I refused to accept that and complained to housekeeping who 30 minutes later came down with towels and robes. 1 day it was my friends birthday so we requested to the hotel to do her a cake. We were assured that when we came back in the evening we would find the cake ready. To our disappointment there was no cake and my friend had to go without 1. Service overall was very poor where even at breakfast staff would say 1 minute when you called them and then never came back. Before leaving we complained to the hotel about all the poor service and were told to compensate all they can do is give us free transport to the airport which clearly wasn't good enough but we accepted the transport. Even after all that we got charged for food we didn't even order and were not given our deposit. We finally managed to get the money back for food we never ordered along with our deposit and were by now ready to leave. The hotel is nice and in a good location but service really lets the hotel down.

The Italian buffet was terrible. Service is not great On requesting extras e.g sauces or cups of tea with your food takes 20 minutes or never turns up . You cannot request ice in a glass of you are not buying there 60 Durham bottles of water.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Katie wrote a review Jul 2016,30,Lovely Hotel - but not great service,The hotel was absolutely stunning it wowed us as soon as we walked in. The check in was very smooth and we we're happy with our room near the quieter pool. I would definitely recommend asking for a room by the smaller/quieter pool and there is music on until late round the bigger pool and never any sunbeds.    Breakfast was AMAZING - couldn't have wanted anything more absolutely everything you can imagine from cakes to fruit cheese fully cooked breakfast etc.    Cocktails/beers were very pricey and not very good. I asked for a cosmopolitan and it had 3 limes in it!!    Lunch was also very tasty although we only had it once as the service wasn't great.    The pool was FREEZING - even though it was sun and 30 degrees every day I literally struggled to get in it and would be numb after 3-4 minutes.    We had a leak in our air conditioning which we called reception about 7 times each time someone would come fiddle with it and then say it was fixed - which it wasn't. So this meant our air conditioning didn't work for the whole week and it was VERY hot.    An average hotel - stunning to look at but not sure that I would go back.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Jacqueline E wrote a review Jul 2016,40,"Friendly, helpful staff - worth paying for a little luxury",After a bit of a disastrous start to our short break by staying in a Riad right in the centre of Marrakech this was a luxurious and indulgent stay. The beautiful reception and welcoming staff followed by a huge pool area with lots of sunbeds with umbrellas cushions and towels was appreciated in the heat. The rooms had all the necessities required for a comfortable stay extras included tv hairdryer complimentary water and toiletries. The shower was huge and had various settings. The bed was extremely comfortable and there was also a coffee machine.  Breakfast was included and there was a huge buffet style selection of cereals breads meats cheeses and various hot dishes plus the freshly cooked omelettes which you could choose your filling and watch it cooked. Fresh juices coffee and tea.  This was definately worth booking via Hotels.com and is just a short ride from the airport and next door to a grocery store and shopping mall. There were also security staff in the grounds of the hotel so you felt safely walking about on your own.    At the time we went it (June) it was Ramadan so alcohol not available in the store next door prices at the hotel were 50-60 Dirham for a small can of lager so quite pricey. We also had trouble with using our bank cards and could only exchange Euro's at the Bureau de Change as they weren't accepting GBP after Brexit.,Date of stay: June 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Wantage, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wantage71
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,yilsen a wrote a review Jul 2016,30,Beautiful hotel with a few minor defaults,I stayed at this hotel for 5 days in June. The hotel is very beautiful with an indoor an outdoor swimming pool and the staff were also very friendly but at times could be abrupt. However I will comment that you have to pay 200 dirams to use the facilities in the Spa but I think for guests the facilities should be free. The swimming pool in the Spa is free to use however if you're not using the facilities in the Spa and only the swimming pool they don't allow you to use the Spa's main entrance. They gave me the directions to the other entrance but it was tricky to find & the Spa staff were not very helpful & said it was by reception. Having gone to reception the other entrance isnt there & was sent around a hoo har trying to find it. We found it eventually but thought it was rediculous that we couldnt use the main entrance to the Spa. They also said the indoor swimming pool is heated however it is cold. I'll also comment that there is a market right next door which is really cheap. I bought a small bottle of water from the hotel & they charged me 30 dirams at the market i bought a bottle of water for 3 dirams so if you want to save money on drinks and snacks use the supermarket. Apart from all these disadvantages it is a lovely hotel.,Date of stay: July 2016,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yilsena
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,1Squashedtomato wrote a review Jul 2016,40,Oasis,We had arranged a pick from the airport at a cost of 200 MAD one way. The person who met us was very professional in his attire and manner. The car was a VW 4X4 so plenty of room for us and our suitcases. The hotel is a 10 minute drive from the airport. Once at the hotel we were greeted by the reception security and entered a very beautiful large reception area. Check in was smooth and quick and we did not expect to be given a room straightaway as we arrived just before 1pm. I expect it was quick because we had arrived during Ramadan. The reception staff were very pleasant could not fault them at all in their customer service.  When making our way to our room we passed the outdoor pool which looked amazing. Everywhere looked so clean and the water sunbeds were impressive too.  Room was a good size and looked fresh and clean just what was expected from a 5* hotel. The breakfast buffet was very good a lot of choice but I suppose could get repetitive if stopping for a while. So the reason why I haven’t rated the hotel 5 is because there didn’t seem to be a range of food services for such a large 5*. There was a Rock bar and a Moo bar. The latter is situated by the pool for drinks and the Rock bar up some stairs. We found the choice of food limited here. There is mall attached to the hotel.  Having said that there are also a few restaurants on the Mall side of the site where you can get food and beverages.  The other reason the hotel didn’t get the full 5 marks was the disappointing Spa. I found this to be very overly-priced and the staff were unable to explain details of the services which were offered. Front desk staff spoke very little English and I felt that whilst I was having a Hamam I was left for what should have been 15 minutes but ended being more like 40 minutes in the end I had to shout out for some attention.  Any tours you book from the hotel will obviously be more expensive then what you might be able to book on the internet. We were going to be charged £130 for a five hour tour to the Atlas Mountain with no refreshment or food. So I did a bit of research whilst at the hotel and managed to book a tour which included Atlas Mountain Lunch and Camel ride for 78 Euros for two. We opted out of the camel ride and the tour organiser adapted it to what we wanted to do. We were given a lovely lunch in a traditional family home sitting on the terrace surrounded by Walnut Trees and other fruit trees and needless to say it was perfect. So shop around.  Apart from these two minuses we had a very enjoyable stay and would recommend this hotel.,Date of stay: July 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1Squashedtomato
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Dario Fontanesi wrote a review Jul 2016,50,The perfect stay in Marrakech!!!,A really warm welcoming with mint tea and fresh towels in the main hall of the hotel which is huge and perfect in every detail. The staff is very friendly professional and helpful: on our last day they gave us the chance to have breakfast in our room with no charge as we had an early flight.  The room is super clean and massive with two bathrooms (one with jacuzzi and shower) living room bedroom walk-in closet and balcony. The king size bed was comfortable and with many pillows. There was a coffee machine with free coffee tea complementary water and minibar.  Inside the hotel you can also find a fantastic spa a gym hairdresser two huge pools and many restaurants to choose from (I advice you to try the Moroccan one).,Date of stay: June 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Sydney, Australia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dariofontanesi
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,lmwah wrote a review Jul 2016,50,100% Staying here again,My boyfriend and I was here for 4 nights during the last week of ramadan.  Staying at the Savoy we amazing from start to finish. I reserved a suite with a city view but asked for a pool view which they upgraded me for free which was lovely.  The entire hotel is fab! From when you walk in the lobby is huge and decorated very well the pool is huge! Never had to worry about getting a sunbed as there were loads available. The breakfast was so amazing as well such a big spread and SO much to choose from our room (the suite pool view) was stunning as well couldn't have asked for more. Nothing at all would I change about this hotel apart from drinks are rather expensive but you have the Carrefour right next door and you can buy things from there and take it to your room which is fantastic!

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Rissacsw wrote a review Jul 2016,40,Very Nice .. Apart From,I returned home last weekend after 5 days at this hotel.    We were picked up by the driver we had arranged with the hotel which costs 200 dirhams which we didn't need to as it's cheaper to get a taxi which cost 70 dirhams but we didn't know this prior to booking the transport.    Our bags were searched outside the hotel but security before we entered .. Standard protocol.    Our check in was quick and we got to go to our room right away.    The rooms are spacious and very clean with a nice balcony overlooking the hotel.    The bathroom is a nice size and the shower is very good once you've fiddled with the water for a while to get it to the right temperature.    Loads of beds around the pool and towels are provided.    We had lunch at the pool bar reasonable priced. I got a pizza which was nice but a lot for one person.    Breakfast is good quite abit of a selection. I just always found the stuff I liked to eat was cold once we got there whether it was 7.30am or 9.30am.    We had dinner at the Italian one night and we got the lamb cutlets it was nice but very small portion for 260 dirhams. I also got room service one night spag Bol 120 dirhams and the portion was a nice size.    The spa this is where I have to moan I found the spa reception staff rude and not helpful. I also don't think the hotel should charge guests to use the jacuzzi sauna and steam room 200 dirhams to use the jacuzzi I think these facilities should be free. The spa staff would not let us walk through the spa to use the indoor pool which was ridiculous and annoying.    I found all the other staff nice and friendly some of the reception staff were rude and abrupt.    The cleaners came round twice a day but on the last night the came in our room and left the door open. Lucky no one came in and took any of our stuff.    All in all I had an ok stay here and would recommend if you want an luxury experience in Morocco how ever I found staying at the Riad Edward the year before an much better experience.,Date of stay: June 2016,Trip type: Traveled with friends,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rissacsw

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,NiaCollymore wrote a review Jun 2016,50,Savvy Savoy - Outstanding Holiday,We checked out of the Savoy this morning after staying for four days as a pre-honeymoon honeymoon and I must say we have had an incredible experience. There is absolutely nothing to fault about our stay. From check-in to check-out the entire trip was flawless.    We were a little cautious after reading a few negative reviews but none of the comments from those reviews seemed apparent during our stay.    We stayed in one of the Master Suites and it was truly sublime. It featured a lounge two bathrooms a large bedroom a terrace and balcony and a luxurious bathroom with an incredible jet jacuzzi and steam shower room. The view overlooked the main swimming pool aswell as the outskirts of Marrakech and even the Atlas mountains (which can only be seen of an evening when the dust settles in the air).    The service was world class. From the moment we arrived to the moment we left we were treated like royalty. The staff was kind and informative and every staff member you walked past said hello and smiled. The food was delicious and the breakfast buffet had so many options from hot food (eggs sausages potatoes fried toast tomatoes omlettes etc) to fruits and yoghurts to pancakes waffles crepes marble cake pastries and more. The waiters was constantly asking if we needed a coffee refill or more juice/water and it was fantastic sitting outside taking in the fresh Moroccan air.    The pools were wonderful too. We swam in the main pool during the day and enjoyed sunbathing on one of many loungers. We swam in the smaller pool at midnight on our second day and stargazed - it was such a lovely experience.    The room service was efficient. We ordered a delightful chicken tagine with preserved lemons and it was top notch.    Everything was clean and neat and the groundsmen work so hard as the whole hotel was pristine.    Of an evening we would sit downstairs and enjoy shisha and cocktails in the outside bar.    We are here during Ramadan so perhaps that added to how attentive everyone was as it was very quiet but our stay was unforgettable and we will certainly return.    We are now moving onto a Riad to enjoy more of the cultural side of things and a little less luxury. I would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to switch off from the world and unwind. If you do it - do it in style and go for a Suite with a pool view - it will be worth every penny.

I don't usually stay in large hotels I prefer boutique in cities but we checked into such a hotel and an hour later were checked in here and with no regrets. The bedrooms are a great size with beds big enough for our 20 somethings to bounce around on in sheer delight! The shower was as large as my en-suite back home!

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,SonnyFamily123 wrote a review Jun 2016,50,Awesome...apart from,We stayed in 5 rooms.. The hotel is clean well kept. The pool is amazing and the rooms are of a good size with a walk in shower. We stayed here during Ramadan and the place was fairly quiet which meant there was no problem getting sun beds poolside.  The breakfast is amazing with a wonderful spread. The drinks in the bar are a little expensive but this is usually the same in other 4/5 star resorts. The hotel is about 10-15 mins from the airport and again the same time into the main Medina square. There is a shopping mall next door which also has restaurants and ATM's in it along with a Carrefour for that all important water and snacks top up.  The only criticism is the slowness of room service/ service around the pool. We had to on a number of occasions ring 3-4 times to chase our order when placed with room service.I would say that anyone looking for a nice peaceful break should consider this hotel as an option..........,Date of stay: June 2016,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Kent, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SonnyFamily123

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,camspear9 wrote a review Jun 2016,40,Very accomodating,We stayed here for 5 nights in June (during Ramadan). Our room was very spacious and we especially liked the big walk in shower. The room was very nice as was the big bed it was very clean and tidy. However one thing to be aware of is that the maids knock at about 9am so if you don’t want t be disturbed it’s best to put your do not disturb sign on the door the night before so as not to be woken the next morning by them. Ramadan didn’t affect the food service at all we managed to eat around Marrakech just fine the hotel is connected to a mall (which has a supermarket in where we got our water) and outside of the mall are some restaurants of which we ate at two - both very nice. There are three pools in total there the biggest is lovely although very cold we went when it was 42 degrees and the pool was still extremely cold although was nice and refreshing after being out in the heat! There are plenty or parasols and sun beds and are even beds in the water which are lovely to sit on. Overall the hotel was very accommodating and close by to a cashpoint supermarket the souks and a short taxi drive away from Jardin Majorelle.,Date of stay: June 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Bath, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/camspear9

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,margot765 wrote a review Jun 2016,10,"DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL, AVERAGE & HORRIFYING CUSTOMER SERVICE",This is hands down the worst hotel that I have had the misfortune of staying in.The customer service was not only the most useless that I have encountered but the rudeness of the Reception Staff border lined on being cruel. It ruined our entire trip. I am beyond baffled as to how this is a 5 star hotel or how this hotel has been able to be affiliated with a quality brand such as a the Savoy. The Brand manager of the Savoy should seriously audit the experience at this hotel in order to protect the integrity of the Savoy name.    Looking through a majority of these comments I see that we are not the only ones who fell victim to their rudeness. We didn’t think it would pose such an issue but it truly ruined the whole experience for my family. After expressing confusion over a booking issue we were treated with hostility and rudeness. The staff persisted in shirking responsibility saying that the issue was with our booking provider and despite getting our booking provider to speak to the hotel they would not accept anything that was being said. Instead we were laughed at scoffed at muttered about under their breath in French as if we weren’t there- right up until the point that they got vicious and threatening.    From this moment on staff muttered and whispered about us as we walked through the lobby and no one showed us kindness at all. It was very upsetting. The fee was never an issue it was the nature of our original booking and how this differed to what they thought we had booked with regards to rooms that was the issue. The truth is they didn’t care about the specifics they didn’t care about what we had to say- they constantly spoke over us and kept repeating ‘you have to pay you have to pay’ despite this never being the issue. After a whole week of trying to speak with someone more senior convinced that someone would care about our treatment and experience we were forcefully told that we had to pay or we could stay elsewhere. Again the point was completely lost by this stage we just wanted to speak to a manager about the treatment that we had been receiving thinking that they might care about how their staff treat people but alas no.    They quite simply just do not care about you. You are there to make them money and they care not one bit about the quality of your experience. They do not want to help you and the concept that someone might apologise or empathise with our treatment was completely alien. Instead we were subjected to rudeness and constant hostility throughout the entire trip.    Nowhere else in the world would we ever have experienced treatment like this. Even if the billing issue could not have been resolved we would have been spoken to with respect and someone would have at least apologised. But no nothing of this kind. Quite frankly they should be ashamed of their conduct.    As if this entire issue wasn’t enough the hotel fell short in so many other areas.    We had to wait over 30 minutes for our airport transfer. No one apologised.    There was confusion over paying for extra facilities like the jacuzzi. One Spa member said it was included but on our return we were told to pay 200 dirhams to swim in it.    Every single day without fail we had to call for an extra towel to be brought to the room. And EVERY SINGLE DAY it took more than 40 minutes to receive the towel following at least one chase call. Furthermore no one ever picked up on the Housekeeping line so everyday we would have to call reception to contact Housekeeping for us. The whole saga took about an hour a day.    Every single day without fail we asked for another water glass in 10 days this extra glass was never delivered.    On one night we tried ordering a bottle of wine to the room this took over an hour to be delivered- for a bottle of wine. We had to call down 3 times to chase this up- and once again no one picked up on the Room service line so we had to call Reception to chase this for us.    The food is average at best. Options for Half Board are very very limited. I recommend eating out anyway as the experience is far superior. I really recommend: Chez Mado in the New Town for top notch fish dishes and Al Fassia and Le Jardin in the Old Town for authentic moroccan magic in beautiful locations.    The quality of the rooms was so very basic. Despite only having been open 1 year the furniture was chipped and tired see pictures- corners have clearly been cut. There was damp and mildew in our shower and a questionable stain on our curtains- all of which we mentioned but nothing was done about this over the course of our whole stay.    Cleaning was done to a bare minimum standard to the extent that we had to ask for it be done again on return to our room one day. And on exit when I checked under the bed to see if we had forgotten anything I was horrified by the level of dust and dirt under there and even more horrified to find a mouldy piece of food from goodness knows when.    On our last night they decided to rebuild part of their Gym at 23:30- loud drilling and hammering continued until after half past midnight. This happened right beneath our room so it sounded like we were sleeping in a building site. I called reception a total of 6 times to ask them to stop the noise. Each time we were promised it would stop it took over an hour for it to stop. What were they thinking? And how on earth did they think this was acceptable in the middle of the night?    This hotel may have technically have the facilities to qualify for a 5 star hotel but the quality and more importantly the service is more akin to you sleeping in a box on the street. The staff made us feel like dirt and therefore the trip was ruined.    I doubt anyone will even care about this review they said as much at Reception in fact they laughed in our faces and said that it would make no difference. So I implore you fellow traveller look elsewhere there are so many beautiful hotels in Marrakech do not let them ruin your holiday and most certainly do not give them your business.,Date of stay: June 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/margot765

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Olivia_Alice2 wrote a review Jun 2016,10,Worst customer service I have ever experienced,This hotel does not deserve it's 5 star rating. The majority of the staff in particular the reception staff were rude unhelpful and arrogant.    I spent 10 days here with my boyfriend and his family and during our stay we experienced a billing issue. The reception staff couldn't have been less interested in trying to help us get to the bottom of the issue. My boyfriend's mum and sisters spoke to numerous members of staff each being inconsistent in their responses but all being equally as unhelpful. Anywhere else the hotel would have communicated with the company the booking was made with and take the stress away from the customer so they could enjoy their holiday - not at Savoy Le Grande! Whilst my boyfriend's mum and sisters tried to fix the problem staff wouldn't listen to them they interrupted them when explaining the problem and they ignored the issues we had. No one ever offered an apology for the problems we were experiencing or the amount of time it took to resolve and they were so reluctant for us to speak to a manager or someone in a position of seniority that had the power to take action. It was only after speaking directly with the company we booked through over about 3 days that the problem was resolved - the hotel played no part in helping overcome the problem.    I have never experienced customer service as appalling as what we experienced here. I feel the reception staff in particular need to be re-trained in how to communicate and help their customers rather than being rude and arrogant in their responses.    It's a shame that the staff at this hotel are so awful as the facilities are on the whole lovely - in particular the pool area. However again we had problems with inconsistent messages from the staff about the cost and availability of the jacuzzi and pool in the spa with one lady saying it was free and one saying it would be 200 dirham. The inconsistencies between messages is off-putting and makes you very reluctant to trust anything that they are saying to you.    I would also recommend not booking your trips through the hotel. We got to know a taxi driver who took us to the Atlas mountains and Palmeraie for far less than what the hotel were offering it at and we got guides stop offs at different places to shop and take photographs. It was an incredible day and I would recommend the Atlas Mountains and a Camel ride to anyone who is going to Marrakech.    We loved our holiday but not because of the hotel. I would definitely advise anyone thinking of going to Marrakech not to stay here and I certainly won't be ever again. A huge shame as the city is beautiful and the pool is a beautiful place to sit and relax by.,Date of stay: June 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Olivia_Alice2

It was a clean and beautiful hotel at such an affordable price and the staff were excellent well trained and very helpful. I have to give a 10/10 for customer service and non intrusive politeness. In a country where one needs respite from the endless streamed hassling it was such a welcoming place to retreat.    The location was a dream; far away from the hustle and bustle but within a realistic distance from the places worth exploring. Additionally it's right next to Menara mall and therefore we didn't have to go far if we needed anything this was crucial as Ramadan meant most places had limited opening times. It was also useful as it was so easy to locate and on a main road which in my view made me feel safer when I was going home as I was out a lot by myself.    To top it all off the bed was super comfortable and the room service was excellent.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,nibrika wrote a review Jun 2016,40,good value for level of quality and location,We arrived early at 11am and were happy to find that an early check in was possible - we had requested a cot for our baby and it was promptly provided along with robes and slippers.    Paid extra for a pool view room and initially I was disappointed to find that our room was overlooking the smaller pool at the back rather than the impressive main pool area but in the end I was happy as our 5th floor terrace had both a pool and Atlas Mountain view. Plus the smaller pool area is much quieter as a DJ plays by the main pool. There is also an indoor heated pool which you can use for free.    The lobby area is impressive as the hotel is newly built and just a few months old the rooms are large and initially look good but on closer inspection you notice a few defects and issues with the finish. There is a fridge with complimentary water bottles and expresso machine but no other tea or coffee making facility.    Free wifi has a good signal all around the hotel and rooms. Our TV did not work properly and we had to call 3 times to get this fixed.    Breakfast is outstanding - a huge range of hot and cold food and drinks including live stations for omlettes and pancakes. Service is hit and miss just depends which waiter you get - but the breakfast room manager was very good and great with our child.  Food and drinks are overpriced at other times in the hotel bars and restaurants there are many restaurants nearby so there is no need to eat at the hotel.    Location of the hotel is very good - 10mins from airport can walk to Medina in about 20mins and the Menara Mall is on your doorstep. Dont miss the panoramic roof terrace around the food court of the mall.    I see a few people complaining that this is not a 5 star hotel and in fact they are correct (it is a good 4 star) but then the real 5star hotels in Marrakech charge 3 or 4 times more per night so it is hardly surprising! We got a good deal at £80 per night and it was very good value at that price.,Date of stay: May 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Marrakech, Morocco",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nibrika

Nice clean modern room comfortable plush bed and very friendly staff. The amazing buffet breakfast was the biggest perk.    Cons: lack a bit of professionalism from one of the managers who I spotted one of scolding some staff in front of customers .

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,HiranGadhia wrote a review Jun 2016,50,Lived up to expectations!,I initially booked this hotel as I wanted somewhere which had a nice sized pool and although some reviews were not very flattering I thought it was worth the risk.    We arrived at the hotel at 10am and although our check-in time wasn't until 3pm they were able to provide us with an early check-in hassle free.    I was travelling was with a friend and we booked a double room which was very well furnished and kept.    In regardless to the location its about 10 minutes walk to the Medina but it's located right next to the Menara mall which makes it easy to grab a quick snack or supplies from the Carrefour.    We walked to the Medina and back a couple of times but it's very cheap to get a taxi or horse drawn carriage if you don't fancy a walk.    Overall we were very pleased with our stay here. The service and attitude of the staff was excellent as was the selection of food available at breakfast!,Date of stay: June 2016,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Leicester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HiranGadhia
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Bart S wrote a review Jun 2016,20,"Underwhelming, inconsistent and indifferent service. Not a 5 star property",Recently spent a 1 week with my wife here on a half board basis.  Overall the review is unfortunately not a positive one. Overwhelming feedback during the week is that service levels do not match the stature and price setting that the hotel claims to be (5 star property)  Predominantly down to poor service across the hotel not just one area.  I list below a list of examples of where I think the hotel delivered very poorly during our week.    - Check in process: in efficient and hotel adamant we had booked/ required 2 rooms.    - Rooms: OK in terms of facilities comfy bed bathroom and amenities are OK    - Room service; very poor and slow. Asked on the first couple of days for a bucket of ice to be delivered it took 2 calls and 45 mins to do so on day 1 and and 30 mins on day 2    - Housekeeping: very poor: poor cleaning standards lack of replenishment of amenities during several days (on 2 days in row e.g. the nescafe pods were not replaced and had to call each time to get new one. Cleaning standard poor. Halfway during our stay bedlinen was replaced but one pillow case that was replace had clearly visible blood stains when it was replaced?  AC powersocket next to my bed #3305 came out of socket and exposed wires!    - loads of contruction and refurbishment work being done during day time with no prior info from either the hotel nor the travel agent. In addition to bar /restaurant areas being refurbished    - Rock pool bar: one day our lunch order (pizza and salad) was still not served more than 45min after ordering with only a few covers in the restaurant. Hotel first denied they had made a mistake and only after a subsequent discussion with the restaurant manager they finally admitted their mistake. Service improved after that quality of food not necessarily. Pizza chef overloaded seafood pizza with mountain of cheese resulting in a non-edible pizza with no flavour at all.    - Bills: on repeated occasions we had issues when signing for our bills after dinner and lunch. The HB concept was poorly explained (ie not at all during check in) and only upon check out was it clarified that the allowance of DIR250pp for lunch only covered food charges (ie a lunch course of 180 for a pizza and 40dir for a bottle of water coming to DIR 220) resulte in hotel insisting I had to pay for the water eventhough the bill was less than the allowance of 250pp.    - Further more experienced on 1st night in Moroccan night a wrong bill where hotel tried to charge us incorrectly for a DIR 490 bottle of wine instead. Matter was eventually resolved but not without a discussion with Maitre D and waitress.  HB concept is very poorly explained and upon check out of the hotel I spent over 30min to get to the correct bill which took 4 attempts by the hotel and discussion with receptionist duty manager and Front office manager!    - Slowness of service:  On our final night we planned to have a drink it the Budda bar next door but was closed due to Ramadan. Instead a night cap at the pool side bar.  Spent over 15 mins seated with only 3 other tables occupied but despite lenghty wait never approached to order our drink so we left frustrated and had a drink in our room instead.    A further example: every day a breakfast the table setting was partial incomplete> one day the cuttlery was missing next day salt and pepper next day the napkin. So totally inconsistent in terms of service and I think training of it staff is the real issue here.    - F&B pricing: very very expensive.  EUR 7 for a bottle of corona.... High end pricing with a service level that does NOT match this.  EUR 5 for a can of pepsi    Overall only one conclusion that the hotel delivers poor poor and slow service across the hotel. When I mentioned this upon check out to the manager he asked me why we had not raised this with guest relations. Could not believe this answer. You are a five star hotel and I am holiday and should not have to worry about these matters.    I think deep down the hotel knows it has problems but think they can get away with it.  I will not return to this hotel nor to Marrakech for that matter....,Date of stay: June 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BartSomsen

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Alberto K wrote a review Jun 2016,40,Very nice hotel in a good location,I booked this hotel for my girlfriend and I for her birthday and it did not disappoint.    We arrived at the hotel around 12pm and we were greeted by a very friendly concierge who took our bags. As we were unable to check in until 2pm we left our backs with the concierge and hit the pool. The pool water was clean and clear as it is cleaned by the hotel every evening. There is also a bar by the pool which serves cocktails and soft drinks and they are brought over to you by the waiters. We went during Ramadan but the waiters were very accommodating so do not feel as if you can’t drink in front of them.    There are also two three restaurants at the hotel. One south of the pool an Italian which is north of the pool and a separate traditional Moroccan restaurant. We ate at the Italian first which was good but if you do wish to eat at the hotel the Moroccan restaurant is lovely with live traditional music. There is also a spa in the hotel and a small gym.    The room was lovely and spotless. We ordered the suite so it included a balcony overlooking the pool and in the distance a view of the city. There was a bit of a kafuffle regarding the rooms where we changed several times as the bed was broken in one and the other wasn’t a suite. The staff dealt with it quickly and efficiently and we were given a room exactly as requested. The bed was very comfortable and it was cleaned to a high standard every day.    The hotel staff was friendly and approachable and helped us with taxis and directions into the Medina and other tourist attractions. When we left the hotel my girlfriends bag was often checked upon return which we thought was a little silly considering we were guests but just be prepared if they do.    The location is great. We walked to the Medina and Gueliz and there are plenty of restaurants within a 2 minute walk from the hotel. There is also a mall if you wish to shop and there is a direct access from the Mall to the hotel. There is a club/bar next door to the hotel if you fancy going out close-by.    On my girlfriend’s birthday the hotel was kind enough to provide a personalized cake and some petals which was a nice touch. They also provided an enormous screen by the pool so that the guests could watch the Euros whilst enjoying Shisha and a drink.    Thoroughly recommend and would definitely book again.,Date of stay: June 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/144albertok

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Takster wrote a review Jun 2016,30,Nice hotel,So we stayed at the Savoy for 2 nights this week. We moved from a riad in the medina to this hotel. The hotel is lovely and the pool is great with good music. However you are just a number in a massive hotel. We experienced such a personal touch at the riad we stayed in the night before that i think it overshadowed the stay in the hotel. Firstly we waited in a queue for almost 40mins to check only to then be told that checkin was at 3pm and we were there at 130pm and it was only open for checkout. It would have been good to have some signs available advising of this. There is a shopping mall right next door so that was pretty cool to kill some time. When we finally checked in there was no information provided on breakfast times check out times etc literally cards given and when i asked for a map they said the desk was only for check in and anything else go to the concierge. Which is fine but i think letting you know what time breakfast runs and what time you should check out by is standard stuff! Then the toilet was broken in our room after 3hrs of reporting it no one came up eventually had to go to reception to ask again. The mini bar was not stocked on either day. A kettle with cups was left in the room but tea/coffee not replenished and there was a sugar sachet. The neighbourhood was great though classy part of town and loads of places to go. The buddah bar was right next door. There was also a supermarket next door worth going into this as its really cheap! We were due to leave early at 7am there was 8 of us staying here so we asked whether we could get any breakfast but was told that breakfast starts at 7am so no but we could order room service at an additional cost. Overall a lovely hotel with a number of bars but i probably wouldnt stay again especially after having experienced exceptional customer service at a riad. We also looked at booking an excursion via the hotel the price given was based on 7 people and the when only 4 ended up going the price was much the same as they said it was based on the big car. They quoted 1800dirhams we went privately via a taxi driver we knew and ended up paying just 600 dirhams!,Date of stay: June 2016,Trip type: Traveled with friends,Midlands,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Takster

The hotel was spotless the room we had was large with a lovely walk in shower  very comfortable bed a large balcony overlooking a super pool. The breakfast had everything you could wish for from smoked salmon to hot doughnuts. It would of been nice to have had tea making facilities in the room there was a coffee machine. Very helpful in having a Carrfours near by for drinks and snacks. We were half board and tried the Moroccan restaurant which was lovely but we loved the Italian restaurant the food was marvellous and I loved the lemon tart the best ever. The staff were great really looked after us RASHID the head waiter took great care in making sure we had an enjoyable meal and time.  The hotel is in a good location to all areas and very quiet no road or club noise. The chief concierge Mehdi Ghaghda was excellent and helped us with making our holiday very special with his advice and help in organising the guides and travel and our trip to the Atlas Mountains. Our guide to the souqs Mustafa was very knowledgeable and took us to places we would never of known to visit he was very caring and a gentleman. I also must say Rasheed ( the very tall doorman ) was very caring and helpful.

I ordered a shisha to smoke by the pool after asking about 10 times within an hour (not over exaggerating) they still came with the same excuse which was 5 mins.... after 1.5 hours I decided this was unacceptable so asked to speak to a manager the girl that worked there said 'I dont know about a manager' but as soon as I said the word manager one of the boys had run off and made it and the shisha had arrived....too late I was already pissed off the manager offered me a complimentary drink and said he was looking for new staff which I really hope he is as when you stay at a 5* hotel you expect a decent customer service in return.  Also if staying here do not order room service defintaly not worth it it takes soooo long to arrive that your better off going to one of the restaurants next door to the hotel. I orderd a cup of tea to my room and after 30 mins the man had arrived with a kettle I went to make my cup of tea only to realise that there was no tea bag I called again and I had to wait ANOTHER 20 mins for the tea bag by this time the tea was cold. After complaining to the hotel manager about this he said he would take it off the bill but he did not.  Nice hotel but staff totally ruin it.  If i had to say something positive it would be about the breakfast & spa staff who were always so polite and smiley.,Date of stay: May 2016,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shazieaz

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,alisonmford wrote a review May 2016,30,Lovely hotel but apalling customer service.,My friend and I booked a short break in this hotel last month. It was intended as a relaxing treat for me as my husband had recently died. The hotel was lovely if expensive we enjoyed some wonderful spa treatments although the dining experience overall could have been better.  Unfortunately on the day of departure we checked out left our luggage with the hotel porter and went to enjoy a last cup of coffee. On our return our luggage was missing. After much mindless running around on their part the staff decided that it had gone in the boot of someone else's car. My friends has since been returned although with some items missing but despite them saying that both cases were together mine has disappeared without trace. Their response since that time has been disgraceful. No compensation no recognition of the distress that has been caused and now no response to any communication. I have travelled extensively in the past and this is not what would be expected from any hotel yet alone one with a Savoy reputation to uphold.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,oxred81london wrote a review May 2016,50,Fantastic Hotel with great staff,We have just returned from a few nights at this beautiful hotel and thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  Our room was large clean and with a lovely comfortable bed and we found all staff incredibly helpful and friendly including at reception concierge bell boys waiters and waitresses and particularly the new manager (Jawad?) at Alfredo the Italian restaurant.  The wide spread of food at breakfast was amongst the best we have known the Moroccan restaurant had great service and good food though we are not particularly keen on tagines but this is personal taste. And the Italian restaurant was so good we ate there every night after our first evening there. We had approached it with some trepidation having read some awful reviews on Trip Advisor tried a different meal each night and loved the wide menu choice the really friendly service and above all the meals which were always very good.  We are also surprised at some of the other negative comments we read. For example there was a large conference on whilst we were there but as the attendees had their own meals elsewhere this had no effect on the service and meals we enjoyed. Despite other comments about the pool we watched it being throroughly cleaned every evening the surrounds washed every morning dirty towels being separated from the clean and overall could find no fault with anything we experienced whilst there.  The hotel will if asked even order taxis for you - but some of the drivers can be a real pain trying to talk you into private arrangements and tours with them instead of just taking you where you want to go! And if we have any slight whinge it would be that it would have been nice to have some free water in our room something many hotels supply.,Date of stay: May 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,london,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oxred81london

After searching without success the CCTV was viewed by the hotel and they discovered our cases being loaded into the wrong car yes mistakes happen and then the saga began. We were told they would get out cases back and forward them onto us in the UK free of charge of course when they received them back at the hotel. Well only 1 of the 2 cases was returned the other has never been found(odd as they were both loaded into the same car!!). I was asked prior to FedEx shipping the case back to me to provide the code to open my case so it could be checked which I gave to the hotel manager. 3 weeks later my case arrived back in the UK only to find that my newly purchased perfume costing £209 Chanel and Hermes 120 mls was no where to be found. The hotel manager told me it was removed by FedEx prior to transit as it was liquids. (and not stolen as I initially thought) However 2 bottles of argon oil (200mls) was still in my case so that blows the liquid theory. FedEx have categorically stated that cases are X-rayed and they do not open cases or packages prior to transit and never request codes to enable them to do so. Therefore back to my original theory that my lovely perfume purchased at Gatwick was stolen by someone at the hotel!

The mall is a work in progress slowing filling up with upscale international stores. But it has lots of light inexpensive eating places and a fantastic indoor kids' play arcade (Inc games and rides) on the top 2 floors.

We found a room available for one night and when we go to the hotel the front desk found us a room for the 2nd night and gave it to us for the same rate we found online which was about US$100 cheaper than the regular rate.    The room was nice clean and had a great view of the pool.    The breakfast spread was huge - wide selection of cereals meats cheeses pastries breads juices both local and western eats. Servers were also very attentive and they can bring fresh juice mint tea and/or coffee any way you want.    Concierge was very helpful in suggesting places to go and helping to figure out taxi fares - something that you can easily get ripped off in.    Bell boys were very attentive and helpful with our luggage.    It's in a great location with a mall and supermarket right next door.    Minor complaints - the coffee maker in our room was broken but we didn't complain about it because we got our coffee fix at breakfast.  Also the way they number the rooms is different from common pract - the first number isn't the floor you're on. We were on the 3rd floor but our room number was 2425. Lastly the wifi in our room was a bit spotty at times.,Date of stay: May 2016,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Guam, Mariana Islands",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gaijen
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,humackenzie wrote a review May 2016,50,So near the Atlas Mountains,I had a room on the ground floor of this hotel which was lovely as it had a patio area which looked out over one of the swimming pools. The ground staff were working constantly to keep the outside areas clean and tidy.  There is a choice of three restaurants Moroccan French and Italian. All three's cuisine was delicious but very small portions. Another drawback that I found was if you are used to eating vegetables every day then disappointingly they were non existent except for cold at breakfast. Overall the staff are extremely polite and happy to help.  I thought that such a large hotel would be very noisy especially as there is outdoor music I need not have worried it was very quiet at night and the beds so comfortable you may not want to get up. Wonderful time wished it was longer.  Because of the closeness about 65k from the Atlas mountains the air is crisp and it makes for easy breathing for anyone with asthma or any respiratory problems.,Date of stay: May 2016,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/humackenzie

Arrived at hotel later than planned due to delayed flight.First impressions were great. There were amazing lit up dancing water fountains and music just to the front of the hotel which itself looked equally impressive. The Hotel was unable to comply with our request for two rooms near each other but had upgraded us to a double bedroomed suite. Well all I can say is that it was amazing 3 bathrooms huge balcony with sunloungers as well as the usual chairs and tables. Fabulous lounge with tvmini fridge and coffee machine. We booked half board. The breakfasts were amazing so much choice. The evening meals in the Italian and Moroccan restaurants whilst pleasant not outstanding. Service in the Italian was painfully slow. Hotel location was great. Attached to a Carrefour supermarket and the Menara shopping mall. Within walking distance of the El Fna Square and souks. Taxi prices reasonable if required. Great place to visit 3 days was plenty as weather pretty poor and rather wet. Pool was great but too cold to use. Indoor pool and spa very good.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,SAli1234 wrote a review May 2016,10,Prestigious Name but bad service,When I searched and found Savoy Le Grand in Marrakech I though why not treat myself and I booked two nights stay. Savoy name carries a high status in the hotel world and I expected luxury and prestige.    What I got is two nights of bad service from the standard check in time which is set at 3pm and you have to then wait for other customers who are eager to check in... So long and frustrating queues. You are lucky if you check in by 4pm.    The lobby bar is so expensive your left with a bad taste. The waiters are well presented but you can sense and feel they are working for a tip. If you can't afford to give a tip after such an expensive drink don't return you will be remembered. Let's leave this story at this junction.    This hotel is not new it used to be Sheraton and about a year ago Savoy have taken over the building and changed a little deco. So it's not new.    After my check in I had to find my own room because the bell boys were all occupied and when I asked directions to my room some of them didn't even know. The check in staff do smile and try to help like they are working in a 3 star hotel.    The concierge were professional but I only dealt with them to activate my wifi connection.    The breakfast spread was nice and the restaurant area was clean. The restaurant waiters were helpful and did care.    The bed is very comfortable and don't dare take anything from the mini bar you will get a surprise at check out.    I am giving 1 point for this hotel only because the breakfast was nice. The customer service and staff are an issue. They can not live to the name or the star rating unfortunately.,Date of stay: May 2016,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SAli1234

However upon arriving at the hotel we were made to wait in Reception for over 40 minutes as we ""weren't allowed"" to check in to our room before this time. I have to agree with others on this site the staff aren't at all helpful they regularly have selective hearing and pick and choose when they wish to respond for Western guests however should an Arabic person request something they fall over themselves to assist!    It just appeared that the staff have no clue how to run such a lovely hotel the hotel itself has everything; beautiful pool fantastic rooms good choice of restaurants and then the staff manage to ruin it all.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Carnorris wrote a review May 2016,20,Fawlty Towers,Outside of the spa (staff and treatments) and the lovely barman in the Bog'art this hotel is at best average at worst poor. Our bathroom had a leak for 3 days despite reporting it twice. The food is poor particularly the Moroccan restaurant which was a massive disappointment. However most of this could be forgiven if the service was good. It's not. With the exception of possibly 2 staff (excluding the spa ladies who are wonderful) most requests are met with either surliness or ignored unless you are willing to persist. And you are pushed to the back of the queue if staff are then approached by a Moroccan. There is no sense of providing guests with an experience or the hospitality this part of the world is famous for. For example a local soap opera was being filmed at the hotel resulting in crew running around and areas being blocked off e.g. we were asked to move when sat by the pool as we were in shot! At no point did the hotel apologise or even explain what was happening. Finally both hotel staff and amenities cannot cope when busy e.g. forget getting a sun lounger unless you wake at dawn and put your stuff down which is frankly a little crazy on holiday! Thankfully Marrakech itself is beautiful and packed with lots of things to see and do. But stay somewhere where customers are valued and well taken care of!,Date of stay: May 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carnorris
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,LondonShrek wrote a review May 2016,30,Good but not quite 5*. Can improve.,My wife and I booked a short 4 day trip to Marrakesh. We arranged a car from the hotel to collect us at the airport which was an excellent service we would recommend. With only one person in front of us at check in we were asked to take a seat then given mint tea and finally 25 minutes later checked in without explanation which was not timely but the staff were courteous. The suite we booked was fine but with an empty mini-bar even without any water. Housekeeping is hit and miss.....first day the staff removed all used towels from the bathroom and only gave one back second day they did not leave any. When I phoned to ask for towels the staff did not understand English and wanted to change our room! Bar staff were very slow to serve. The breakfast buffet was poor in quality and lack of seating available because the staff did not clear finished tables. The staff appeared disorganised at breakfast lots of them but inexperienced supervisors changing their tasks by the minute meant nothing got done. Coffee was always cold. Also difficult to find plates as they were grabbed as soon as clean ones came from the kitchen. Very limited numbers of sun loungers around the pool so go early and not after 9.30am or they will all be taken.,Date of stay: April 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LondonShrek
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,XLauraox wrote a review May 2016,40,Chilled break,Just returned from a 5 night stay here with my partner. Lovely hotel very clean comfortable sun beds and brilliant room. Couple of comments i would pass on if thinking of booking this hotel; the hotel supply towels for sunloungers they put these out around 8.30 and if you arent there then to reserve a bed you wont get one. my boyfriend wakes early enough to reserve so was going to pool and reserving with a t shirt and bag of suncream ready for us to have breakfast around 9.30 then go to the pool so if you both want a lie in you wont get a sunbed. Breakfast was lovely lots of pastries fruits hot waffles and pancakes. Again if you want to sit outside and have your breakfast you need to get down early. Also when i asked for a coffee on a few days they did not bring it and was only when my partner went and asked again twice that they bought it over. When lying round the pool the Moroccan people seem to get service on there sun loungers whereas on a number of occasions we asked for a drink to be bought over and was just ignored or told to go to the bar. Everything is v slow and chilled here which is fine but if you want a drink go to the bar 10 minutes beforehand. Hotel is really quite central has a buddha bar next door and mall (however i wouldnt call this a mall in my opinion not really worth going although this is where you can buy cigarettes) theres also the Sofitel hotel around the corner (So night lounge restaurant) which i definitely recommend. We booked a tour through the hotel was picked up in a lovely car with a driver and tour guide but was 1500 dirhams so not cheap. Our tour guide was called Zaki lovely man and v knowledgable although he did take us to few specific places within the medina (carpet shop) where we was then expected to buy a rug which we did not want and then felt guilty when not purchasing. Although if this is your first time visiting i definately recommend getting a tour guide to show you around but tell him first off you do not want to buy just browse and see the sights. We was taken to a mosque an old university which is now for tourists to look around (extra 20 dirham each to get in) the souks and Jemma El Fna. Restaurants in hotel are rubbish for evenings to be frank Italian restaurant had absolutely no atmosphere and food wasn't great so if you don't want to venture out in the evenings don't stay here as food is limited. Nice area of an evening to have a drink though. Get a taxi to the Gueliz area one night if you're staying in marrakech as it is the European quarter and a nice break away from hectic Medinas. Get a taxi to 'La Ttrottoria' (we wouldn't have found it had we not asked taxi to take us) it is an italian and i couldn't recommend it enough absolutely beautiful restaurant. All in all a nice hotel but there could be improvements when it comes to service and food.,Date of stay: May 2016,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/XLauraox

It was large with a separate lounge cloakroom a large bedroom with a super king size bed a walk in closet and a well equipped bathroom.    We were on a half board basis but after a visit to the Moroccan and the Italian we decided to dine out! The Moroccan was better than the Italian but there was no ambience. The breakfast was great with a wide variety of food to choose from. I particularly enjoyed the freshly baked crepes and could not get enough of them.    One asset to this hotel is their staff and they do their outmost to make your stay a memorable one. One that stood out for us was Mr Rasheed at the Concierge desk.    The hotel is in a posh area next to a mall. There are good number of restaurants nearby but for us having a supermarket next to the hotel was a blessing. You can reach the city centre within half an hour if you are walking but cabs don't cost much I think we paid 50 dirhams each way.    Airport is a ten minute drive away and the famous Buddha bar is next door.    All in all it is a good hotel but the management need to focus on the restaurants and the food they serve.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Samiyah04 wrote a review Apr 2016,40,"Great Location, Potent Perfume, Diverse Breakfast","This hotel is located in the New City. Initially I stayed in the Old city for almost a week and then we wanted to try something New and were wanting a 5 star hotel.    Here are some pros and cons and I hope that helps you guys decide where you would like to stay. Some of the Cons would personally make me not stay there again but they may not be a big deal to other people.    Pros:  Location is wonderful it is adjacent to the mall a Carefour (grocery store) and many outdoor/indoor restaurants/night life. It was also next to a Buddha Bar which is a hip/upscale sushi drinks place that is open until 4 am.    The pool is breathtaking when we went there in April it was not heated but if it was it would have been beautiful to swim in they have relaxing lounge chairs immersed in the water.    The decor is beautiful    There is security present outside of the hotel as well as before you walk into the hotel (the whole of this city is pretty darn safe so that isn't really a big deal but extra protection is always great)    You can call a taxi from the street pretty easy (see ""Con"" for this as well)    The breakfast had an array of offerings and was very nice and clean the orange juice was amazing    Room service 24 hours was nice and the wine selection was great    It is a new hotel about 6-7 months old and was previously a Sheraton    Cons:  If you do not have your own driver it takes a while for them to call a taxi because they aren't waiting so you have to wait 10-15 minutes but if you walk outside on the road you can get it right away. We had an amazing driver that has a tourism car that was wonderful and was also the driver in the movie Spectre he is familiar with the area and actually comes out to being cheaper than taxis etc. If you guys would like to use him I highly recommend it his name was Lhoucine and his number was +212 661-322328. He showed us all around town and the happening areas to go. We always felt very safe with him and it was better than the smokey taxi drivers.    The hotel rooms were connected from the outside so you would have to walk through the pool area in order to connect to your side of the building.    The smell/aroma in the lobby was extremely over-powering it smelled like incense on steroids. If you are sensitive to smells or get migraines this is not the hotel for you.    If you go anytime before May-June they do not turn on the Air Conditioning We were 6 people that did not sleep well for 4 days and it was extremely frustrating. We called maintenance one guy told us that it is not working (which was false) the other guy told us if we kept the ""air"" on it really means that the heat is on so we had been blowing heat on us. We complained and after 4 days they sent us a ""presidential fruit basket"" that consisted of less fruit than I would put in a normal bag at the grocery store. After hours and waiting and complaining on our last day they agreed to a spa service but this really did not make up for our days of inconvenience and arguing with them. This was definitely not 5 start service and sometimes the front desk people act like they do not know English when in fact they do this was very frustrating for us.",Date of stay: April 2016,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Las Vegas, Nevada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Samiyah04

The hotel looks like a village for its enormous size indoor and outdoor facilities restaurants and bars. It is located besides Menara Mall a big and modern shopping mall in Marrakech. Taxi can be taken from street outside the hotel to Old Medina of Marrakech for 50 Moroccan dirhams (about €5).    The room service and reception service is generally slow in response. Too many people to serve with a few hotel staff. The restaurant serving breakfast is full of people in mornings especially toward 10AM. People lines up long for the kitchen omelette and the likes.    We haven't used the minibar but there were 4 minibar items added to our bill.

It is a very expensive place if you are planning to spend money at the bar's and restaurants £4 for a can of coke £15 for a single Smirnoff vodka and Red Bull. We soon seen there is a supermarket next door to the hotel. We started going there and buying a bottle of vodka and red bull and loads of cans of coke as we worked out it is a lot cheaper. Saved us lots of money :). You could always get a sun lounger at the pool what was good :) as some resorts get overly busy :/. Room service was a bit slow could improve that. The pool was very cold. Could make the water more warmer. The view from our balcony was over looking the pool which was nice. On the night it gets a lot colder then you'd expect so pack some trouser and shirts long dresses and a jacket.

I would recommend this hotel to anyone and would definitely stay here again.,Date of stay: March 2016,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"West Sussex, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IS_Scotland

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Paula D wrote a review Apr 2016,40,"Great for a couple of days, good value and near the airport and medina.",We stayed here for 2 days after having a bad experience in a Riad in The Medina. The hotel feels quite transient and not somewhere I'd want to stay for more than a couple of days however it is very reasonably priced with smart bars and good restaurants. They have an amazing inside pool/spa area and two large outdoor pools. The rooms were very spacious with balconies. Staff were courteous and all in all we were very satisfied.,Date of stay: March 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Hastings, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/694paulad
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Too_Much_TM wrote a review Apr 2016,30,"A Hotel of Two Extremes : 5* facilities & food, 1* Service","Whilst the leisure facilities are exceptional - beautiful huge pool and indoor heated pool with jacuzzi and the food us amazing - extensive options for breakfast including freshly prepared eggs crepes waffles daily and location (10 mins to Medina next to Carrerfour) it is hard to completely overlook the extremely POOR service. This is definitely not a five star hotel so wish they would stop claiming to be to manage guests expectations.    Basic issues are :staff communication not welcoming and very slow to respond.    For starters before I arrived I emailed them twice to inquire about the spa facilities- but I received no answer.    Then over 2 days we made no less than 8 calls to house keeping concierge AND room service to ask for a kettle to boil water for tea. According to a few websites it said a tea/coffee maker was included -which is why we didn't bring our own.  Between each department we call nobody understood our request. Eventually we had to google translate the word into french and then they finally understood. I find this unsatisfactory given they are in a highly touristic area I would expect the staff to be able to at least communicate on basic every day words in English.    During breakfast it was rare for us to be welcomed shown to a seat greeted with a smile. We saw to ourselves. We usually had to ask at least twice for tea before it arrived. On one day we received an apology from management at least.    In general every call we made to housekeeping is a frustrating one - when we asked for two towels we get one. When we asked for decaf coffee pods we got 4 espresso and so on.    I also fedback to the conference organisers so they are aware.    I raised my concerns to the Guest Relations Manager while I was there who couldn't get what we needed right away but did offer a temp substitute. But she disappeared from the radar for the days after (instead of keeping in touch to ensure I got what I needed after all - worthy of 5 star). I also sent an email to the manager while I was there but didn't hear back for 2 days- after I left. The hotel said they were sorry appreciated my comments said their staff is going through a training programme and offered me an upgrade on my next stay. I tried to explain that whilst that was appreciated my poor experience was too hard to ignore and I would need more to convince me to stay there again and to alter my public opinion - haven't heard back. Not quite the ""5 star"" service I have enjoyed at other hotels - so next time I'm in Marrakesh I will definitely think twice about going back here - amazing pool notwithstanding!

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,SarahBailey2014 wrote a review Mar 2016,50,Amazing hotel in great location- wouldn't stay anywhere else if I came back to Marrakech,Stayed here for 4 nights last week. We were greeted at the airport by driver we paid 200 Dirham one way. We were a little delayed and he waited without charging us anything extra. Regular taxis cost 70 Dirham but they constantly try rip you off so I would recommend booking with hotel on arrival. No queues so you don't waste precious holiday relaxation time. The driver was waiting for us as we arrived with a a Mercedes car so it was well worth spending that little more for a smooth start to the holiday. As we ran out of money towards the end of the trip we ordered regular taxi for the return trip to the airport.    Hotel lobby and all facilities are lovely- lots of pools and sun lounger so you never felt crowed in communal areas. Wifi was great through out the hotel.    At check in we were upgraded to a suite- lovely touch! Room was wonderful- spacious with a gorgeous view of the pool. Jacuzzi bath was great after a hard day working on my tan :) Cannot fault the room- we had a leak in the sink but someone came within 10mins to fix it.    Ate at the Morrocan restaurant- the lamb tajine with apricots and dates was scrumptious! Restaurant lacked a bit of atmosphere but that was our fault as we went to eat too early at 8pm- people don't eat till late here!    Breakfast was so nice- we were spoilt for choice!  The staff we encountered from reception to cleaners to concierge to pool bar staff were incredible! Everyone was smiling and always happy to help! This is what made our trip so enjoyable! I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting. The value you get for the price you pay outweighs any negatives (not that there were any).    Thank you Savoy Le Grand we had a great stay!!

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,2SunSisters wrote a review Mar 2016,30,Wanted to Love it...,My travel companion and I happened upon this hotel while seeking free Wi-Fi to book another hotel. The bellman was very gracious and allowed us to enter through the metal detectors to have a seat on the couches in the lobby. Yes you read correctly they had metal detectors upon entrance. I noticed this in more than a few nice places in Marrakech. I guess we were a low risk to security because the concierge also gave us the Wi-Fi code when I gave him my honest story. We were two women who came to town with no hotel (but having done research) and were roaming down Mohammed VI Blvd with bags at almost midnight.  We decided to take a look on the Internet for the price of the hotel and we were expecting that it was out of the range we desired to pay. However the room came up as $86 a night and included a full breakfast. That was our deciding factor and we ended up staying at the hotel for four nights.  GENERAL HOTEL  The lobby was absolutely beautiful and had fresh flowers placed throughout it. The pool area was lit up at night and was gorgeous. It was only about 50 something degrees when we arrived that evening and we did not expect to spend much time at the pool but there were definitely people out sunbathing during the day in 60° weather. February is low season so the hotel was not fully booked. We were told that the hotel just opened six months ago and while it was really well-kept it did not necessarily look like it had just been opened. Our room had two double beds and was spacious with a contemporary decor. The bathroom had some type of natural stone and a full walk-in shower with a rain shower head. The breakfast was in one of the restaurants and there was a very large spread. It seemed that the hot Moroccan items in the middle were never heated. However you would not go hungry as there were omelettes a crêpe station and some other type of olive oil bread station and plenty of pastries and fruit. The coffee always smelled and looked delicious. The spread was well worth the inclusion in the hotel cost. I had drinks in both the front hotel lobby and the back. The decor in the back was more my style but they were both fine. The exact same wine costs $2 more in the front. When I called it to their attention I just got an oh really response from the bartender. You will understand a little more if you keep reading.  SERVICE  In general hotel service was pretty good and started out excellent at midnight but stabilized after the first evening to just good enough. The night staff seemed to be a bit more into service than others. Again it was good but not worthy of a five-star rating.  Several people at the hotel asked us how things were but it seemed they were ill equipped to respond when things were not perfect. For example after being given misinformation from the concierge that there would be live music in one of bars I mentioned it to him the next day that there was no music and he offered no apology or even any words he just nodded. Also in the spa the person I was with had the hamman experience and was quite disappointed with it. It just did not feel like the description or what we understood the experience to be from reading reviews and being very familiar with Turkish and Korean bathhouse experiences. When we were asked how we were doing after the services we responded with it was OK and even stated a little disappointing. You have to pay to use the sauna even if you book a service and there was no steam room so the spa experience felt incomplete. The person in the spa was pleasant but did not ask what was wrong just nodded and kind of said hmmm. That definitely would not or should not be the response at a five-star hotel. There was only one person who was rude and I only saw her at the spa one day sitting by the credit card machine and not greeting guests. All of those who greeted guests at the spa were generally pleasant. I don't want to include her name but the rude spa person was having trouble running my credit card and was very curt. She acted as though she didn't believe that this is the same credit card that I used at the front desk and when we eventually had to walk to the front desk to run it and the front desk told her she was doing it incorrectly she was unapologetic. No acknowledgement of the extra time it took me to walk to the front for being curt or for telling me it has to be my card. Nothing. I don't think there was a language barrier but it was very strange that everyone (excluding the one rude employee) responded the same way when there was feedback that something needed to be fixed or wasn't quite right. I do want to note that housekeeping and those working in the breakfast restaurant and bellman as previously mentioned were all very pleasant. The hotel was definitely worth staying at but they may want to work out a few service kinks.,Date of stay: February 2016,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"New York City, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2SunSisters

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Beyond81 wrote a review Mar 2016,30,Service is the issue here,"We have just returned from a 7 night stay on half board.  The early reviews of this hotel prompted our booking. It looked and sounded great. However just before our holiday the feedback was becoming increasingly worrying.  We set off with a positive attitude and put the negativity out of our minds. But it soon became apparent that the comments were entirely justified.  The hotel itself is stylish comfortable and in a great location.  More attention is given to maintaining the look of the building than is given to the guests which is worrying.  The service however or should I say lack of it is what is letting this establishment down badly! I hope the hotel senior management take note and see the feedback comments as a gift.  The restaurants in particular are where you see staff struggling to meet the needs of their customers. Tables are missing cutlery you have to repeatedly make requests for drinks. Plates are not removed and generally the guest seems invisible to the staff who all seem very pre occupied.  The food offer is limited for dinner.  The pool area is lovely the staff work very hard to clean the pool that no one uses as it is freezing but the most SHOCKING observation was that the beautifully rolled towels that are placed on every bed at the start of the day are re used over and over again. As guests leave their used towel on the bed when leaving the area the attendant quickly picks up the ""used"" towel re rolls it for unsuspecting guests. This happened repeatedly every day! How UNHYGIENIC is that?  My husband reported this. Nothing changed.! DISGRACEFUL!  We have travelled to many places and stayed at lovely 5 star hotels but the Savoy LeGrand is not YET one we could recommend.  This hotel has clearly had a huge investment and if it is to promote itself as a 5 star it clearly has to change.",Date of stay: March 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Surrey, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Beyond81
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Markymark29061964 wrote a review Mar 2016,40,The staff make this hotel,From when we arrived to when we left the staff were absolutely fantastic and could not do enough for you. We were upgraded to a executive suite which was fatastic but it had a few issues. The patio doors would not lock and the hairdryer stopped working but these were fixed in no time at all. The breakfast was amazing and so much to choose from. Unfortunately this cannot be said for the resturants for the evening meal. The Moroccan food was ok but there was no atmosprere. This was due to the fact that there were only 3 tables taken. Still the staff were very pleasent. The Italian however was a different story. Everyone knows that the predominant herb used in Italian cuisine is oregano. This resturant insisted in using rosemary in both their bolognase and on their pizza`s. Must be a Moroccan thing!. We did however find a fantastic resturant a 10min walk towards the centre called The Red House. The whole experience was fantastic from the quaility of the service to the best food of the holiday. They serve both their local dishes and international and all of their menu was accomplished. Not to say anything about the georgous belly dancer. I cannot understand hoe on earth this Restaurant/guest house is rated so low this can only be due to the fact that it is unseen from the road.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Dennis N wrote a review Mar 2016,40,"Good hotel, conveniently located between the airport and old town but not quite worth a five star rating",Mid-March I stayed in this hotel for one night. We had a bad start as check-in took a very long time. The receptionist took my passport and summoned to take place on the couches in the lobby and to wait. Waiting took a long time no drink was offered. After I took a seat it seemed that people who arrived after me were checked-in on the spot. After roughly 20 minutes waiting I went back to the front-desk and asked whether they could check me in as I just had a 20 hour trip without sleep behind me. The front office employee continued with the check-in procedure and told me that I was upgraded to a suite as the room category I booked was not available anymore. This was of course very nice. The resort consists of a bunch of buildings centered on a large courtyard where the pool and several terraces were located. The suite I was assigned was on the back-side of the complex in a slightly older wing. The suite was very large and had a living room large bedroom two balconies and a large bathroom. The view unfortunately was rather limited (a concrete wall from the shopping center next door). The bathroom needed some upgrading as the glass door of the shower cabin was not properly fitted and could not be closed.    The breakfast buffet was the best we had during our Morocco trip with a huge selection of fresh food and even smoked salmon staff was friendly and relatively efficient.    During my stay I also used the heated indoor pool located in the basement of one of the buildings. The water was not that warm though but still warmer than the unheated outdoor pool. The pool itself was quite large and the ambiance was nice. The hotel also boasts a gym seemed relatively ok but I did not use it during my stay. It was unfortunate that the sauna/ steam room could only be used against a rather high fee… a facility that to my opinion should be available for use to hotel guests at no extra charge in hotel that considers itself five-star.    Check-out was a disaster. The whole process was chaotic and as a result we had to wait quite a long time before we were checked-out. Somehow one needs to show security at the entrance/ exit of the building a ticket with a number as proof that one really checked out and paid. The reception clerk forgot to give us this ticket; this created an awkward situation upon leaving the building as the security guard did not let us through.    Long story short this property is rather nice and well located (for either airport train station or city center) but I find it difficult to rate my experience as excellent as certain things (particularly service) need improvement.,Date of stay: March 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Bern, Switzerland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/251DennisN
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,missjemjem wrote a review Mar 2016,50,Beautiful hotel with amazing service!!,So I am still here and I am writing this review that is how much I loved it!!    Firstly the hotel is beautiful and the pool area is amazing! However the one thing I would say is the pool is cold but it could be the time of year that we are here it is refreshing when it's a hot day!    The service from reception concierge to the housekeeping are wonderful the staff can't do enough to help and give great advice on places to visit and what to do!    The food here is good nice breakfast selection and the restaurants are amazing too the Moroccan restaurant especially! Pool good is lovely although a little price my compared to restaurants around but worth it for convenience and it's good quality!    When we arrived we were instantly upgraded to a suite with a pool view and the rooms are stunning!! If I came back to Marrakech I would without a doubt come back here for the price you pay it is worth every penny!!    Only two things I would say need improving  the spa pools that are free for guests are cold especially the jacuzzi which with the temperature it is isn't one! we noticed twice that we had a sewage smell from the bathroom!

My room was very clean overlooking the swimming pool. The bed was comfy and I enjoyed bathing while watching TV-having a window between the bedroom and bathroom has its benefits.  The hotel has a gym and jacuzzi-I tried them both one evening and loved the experience. Also there is a restaurant by the swimming pool where we had our lunch on the second day.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Loves_To_Travel229 wrote a review Mar 2016,20,Looks can be deceiving!,"We have just returned from a 4 night stay at the Savoy Le Grand hotel.    We had daily problems with our electricity. The power points did not work and neither did the heating (which was needed as evenings are very cold in March). Each time we tried to call the hotel reception nobody answered! Then someone came said they would call an electrician a maid came with an adapter who could not speak english I explained we did not need an adapter and then finally an electrician came to reset the electrics. We needed the electrics resetting every day and every time we called reception we could not get through. I called concierge to pass on a message to reception and 2 hours later nothing had been done. When I had called concierge they said they had left a message with an operator and by this time I was very frustrated.    On the Monday we ordered food from the Rocks Bar to be delivered to our room after a long day at the Atlas mountains. The food arrived cold and was pretty much two sandwiches and chips for about £28 - Do not eat at the hotel! The mall next to the hotel is reasonable and far tastier!! My husband and I were so tired that we just left the food and did not complain at that time. We knew the problems with getting through to reception and found that the only way to complain was to walk directly to reception which was a long walk!    On checking out I complained about the numerous problems with electricity which had happened right up until the end of our stay. I explained that my phone even had to be charged at reception and we were constantly struggling with phone battery on our trips because of the lack of electricity. The kind gentleman said he would need to speak to management.    Later a man in suit who was quite possibly the rudest and most intimidating man I have come across a Manager Mr Tariq looked at me in a threatening manner and questioned why I had not complained about the food on the Monday. He said ""why did I sign for it""?""!!! I explained that my husband had signed for the food at the rocks bar it then came later cold. I also explained about the electrics - he just said you did not complain earlier. He was aggressive rude and did not give me the chance to complain. I said to him that his customer service was terrible and he just shrugged it off. I can see that other people have commented on the management here - we were left with a sour taste.    Such a new hotel when compared to the Meridian and Sofitel it doesnt come close. No point having a beautiful hotel when it doesn't work and then you have aggressive managers who refuse to take on board the feedback given!    The concierge were fabulous (apart from the one lady who took my call about the electrics) and very helpful but all in all I would not recommend this hotel - I know there are much nicer hotels. It is a shame as it is in a great location but perhaps the hotel managers know this and take advantage of that. Basically if something is wrong in your room or you need more toilet roll or towels you will be waiting for hours and hours. They have not got enough staff to manage the size of the hotel.",Date of stay: March 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Loves_To_Travel229

I was very disappointed along with my friends we had to drag our cases and hand luggage to our rooms .not a good start . also on opening the wardrobe door the coffee glass came of the side and shattered in to pieces. We phoned reception and they sent two people from house cleaning up to sweep and hover. but during the night my sister cut her foot on. The glass. In the Morin we could see it was still on floor and we found loads under the beds . we decided to go and see someone at reception. We were told it will be sorted and it was . we were offered a free hour in the suna and juzzci . that was nice of them Thank you . . also having Left The sofitel because. My friend joined us. On our holiday to make 3 adults. We were surpised to see at the Savoy we had the same beds of which were two doubles and had to share them . or have a very small child's bed put at the end of the bed . but with 3 suitcases it was impossible. Other than this the hotel is beautiful . and pool staff and restaurant staff were very helpfully and welcoming. Would like to say a big thank you for turning our holiday around and making our 4 night stay a nice one after the reception we got at the beginning at reception.thank you for the ever so helpful life guard.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Sir_Sean wrote a review Mar 2016,20,"Promised so much, delivered so little!",This hotel starts to go wrong before you even get to Marrakesh. Fundamentally it shouldn't have 'Savoy' in its name. It is a 'genuine fake' trading on the Savoy name. Unfortunately the name raises expectation which it then fails to deliver on.  The actual hotel is quite nice if you can avoid the hot insanely noisy rooms overlooking the nightclubs most of them are modern well fitted and comfortable. The lobby is nice and the Spa is rather lovely. All of this is let down by the dire service.  You only need to read the previous reviews to see the hotel has a problem in this area. My experience started with check-in. Like everyone else it seems I was shown to the obligatory sofas to wait for a room. We waited and waited and waited. I had paid extra for an early flight I should have saved my money as I spent what seemed like an age waiting for a room. No mint tea either but after tasting it that was no bad thing. When they took my wife and I to our room it wasn't the suite we paid for it was very small and probably the worst room in the hotel overlooking the roof and air conditioning ducts of next doors nightclubs. We decided there and then we would check out and find a proper hotel. Before doing sowe went to request a room change and got bored with waiting so went for a drink. Another two hours later they found us a Suite which was very nice and a big relief. The suite was huge big bed sitting room bathroom shower and 2 toilets. Decent T.V channels as well. If only the service could match the rooms the hotel would be good value.  We paid for Half-board which I think should be changed to half-bored as the food on offer was pretty poor. Breakfasts were nice with a big choice but service outside was probably the worst I have ever experienced anywhere. You literally had to chase staff around for cutlery coffee juice etc. Thank God everything else was self-service otherwise you would be in there until lunchtime. For the evening you only have a choice of two restaurants an Italian serving a 'motorway services' take on Italian food or a traditional Moroccan which although better treated you like a competition winner when they found out you were getting your evening meal for 'free'. Then chased me up the path to remind me the bill 'does not include service' which I hadn't felt we had received. The half-board options were very limited and you could only order certain meals same in the Italian. We were there for 7 nights and on the third night we decided it was better to have a lunch in the hotel and to eat elsewhere in the evening. The Rock bar up the stairs by the pool served the best food but was made to look good because everywhere else was so bad. The service at the Moov bar by the pool would have been hysterically funny had we not been paying £5 for a lukewarm half-pint can of Heineken served in dirty glasses and had to watch 'the barman' read the ingredients for a cocktail from the menu whilst scrambling around under the counter looking for mixers. If you are visiting this hotel save yourself the various dramas/tantrums/Basil Fawlty moments and buy your beers and wines from the Cave in the Carrefour store next door. Better choice and a third of the price.  Going back to the beginning of this review if the hotel stopped calling itself 'the Savoy' (which it is a million years away from) got rid of the management who all like to walk around in suits looking important but achieving nothing and invested some time in training its staff it could actually be a good hotel. There were some glimmers of hope; the staff in the Rock Bar were great except one day when they all seemed to fall out over an incident with a chicken and all the staff on the Concierge desk were really helpful. That's about it. Everywhere else reception restaurants and the appalling Moov bar treated you like a major inconvenience getting in the way of their almost constant arguments this would stop me ever visiting this hotel again.,Date of stay: March 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Royal Tunbridge Wells, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sir_Sean
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,MinRob wrote a review Mar 2016,40,Sun in March wiithout a longhaul flight,We stayed here for 1 week in an executive suite with a pool view. Our rooms were on the third floor and we had a lovely view of the snow covered Atlas mountains .The outdoor pool was too cold to use but the 2 indoor pools were fantastic.  We had some problems - on check in we were given the wrong room - this is not a good start . We had to have repairs to the TV the coffee machine and the plug in the wash basin but these were dealt with very quickly once reported.  The hotel has a luxurious look and we found the staff friendly and welcoming. Special mention of Mehdi Ghaghda the chief concierge who was excellent and very helpful.  I would recommend taking a travel kettle if tea is required. No milk provided with the coffee machine.,Date of stay: March 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MinRob
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,tom s wrote a review Mar 2016,10,"Pretty hotel, ugly service.",The Savoy le Grand.. Aesthetically grand indeed. However the service provided to its Guest's is far from Grand.    The restaurants (of which two are available for everyone to access not three):    - The morroccon restaurant was lovely the food was superb. However the menu was very limited and I don't expect to be rushing out for a Tagine anytime soon.  - The Italian was awful. I don't consider myself a brilliant cook infact my wife would say my cooking talent is non-existent. However the salmon we were given was sour? The soup was water with diced vegetables? The pizza was undercooked (mozzarella I might add!). A terrible effort and an embarrassment to Italian cuisine.    The room (or should I say sauna!):    - Upon arrival we were guided to our room which was again very grand. However it was unbelievably warm so we opened the balcony door to let some air in. However we closed the balcony door as we were ready to sleep.. In a secure environment. My wife likes to be warm whilst she sleeps but this was ridiculously warm even for her! We asked for someone to come and have a look at the air conditioning. We were told that the centralised system was operating in heating mode as it is winter and his advice was leave the balcony door open! To which we eventually accepted and proceed to sleep with one eye open. Relaxing!    Excursions (daylight robbery):    - We booked with the holiday one trip to the medina and another to the atlas mountains.  - The trip to the medina was an diabolical. Our guide was taking us round to his friends shops where we were asked to part ways with lots of money. The cynic in me believes he was getting a cut of their lavish profits! Do not use this service. We met a friend morroccan on our walk back out to the medina by ourselves who charged us only 50 dirham. A price much less than the 1500 dirham price tag we paid to the hotel! He was very protective of us and took us to much more reasonably priced shops. Thank you abdel aziz!  - Hamid our driver and guide to the atlas mountains was brilliant. He was very friendly and made our day very enjoyable.    Guest relations (hotel defense system):    - We kept quiet about our complaints as typical Brits do. However upon checking out we were told that our half board was no longer available and couldn't utilise the services because we turned up late on our arrival (what?)  - The final straw was taken and we issued our complaints. The guest relations manager was bullish and was far from empathetic. She was very defensive and utilimately have left us with a sour taste in our mouths.    On a plus note: Fathima and Abdel Jaleel were both brilliant and very friendly.    Sorry I cannot give you a more positive review but do not visit the Savoy le Grand. It is grand in construction but the foundations (service) is made of cheese!,Date of stay: March 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z7440UItoms
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Francois Mouri wrote a review Mar 2016,20,ruined experience in such a beautiful city.,Me and my boyfriend had had such a great experience in marrakech on our last visit while staying at the sofitel. while celebrating our anniversary we decided to visit marrakech with a group of friends that had never been to marrakech and share the experience. This time arround we decided to try out a different hotel and booked Savoy Le Grand. as it ticked all the boxes we required from our previous experience.    We arrived at the hotel around 11am we went to the check in desk and were asked to hand in our passports and then take a seat bare in mind we were not asked to show any reservations. 30 minutes later my boyfriend then went to ask what was going on again we were asked to take a seat as check in was at 3pm So we went to eat at the restaurant outside whilst my boyfriend kept going back and forth to the reception desk. In the most unprofessional manner the guy at the reception was telling my boyfriend that he could not find the reservation we had to forward them the emails they had sent us as confirmation yet they were still unable to find our reservation long story short.. 4 hours later they managed to sort something out and give us our room keys.    However we were told that we still had to pay an amount of 3 nights as they hadn't found one of the reservations we made from trip advisor (which was another unprofessional issue) they gave us 2 days to sort it out so my boyfriend went and paid the remaining amount he was asked too after not being able to get in touch with trip advisor the receptionist at the desk clearly stated that it was the total fixed amount to be paid and that there was nothing more to be paid.    WRONG!!!    On our last day as we were checking out we were asked to pay another 2000 dirhams which is around £145 this was not acceptable we were told everything was paid for so why were they telling us to pay more? Because the guy that had said the total fixed amount was paid for had made a mistake this left us in a sticky situation because we had gone on holiday with a budget and when we were told our hotel was paid for we comfortably used the rest of the money we had left over so to be asked to pay an extra amount on our LAST day was very unprofessional. However we paid for the amount they asked for and then we asked them to give us the bill for each room and so they did we went to summarise that remaining amount and as we were paying we were again told that there was more to pay for for the other rooms.    the whole point of booking a 5* hotel is to improve your stay/comfort and make it as relaxing as possible. This wasn't the case during our stay at the Savoy. while checking out one of the managers offered us some discount during our next visit which i though was insulting as we wasn't looking for a bargain but just a great comfortable stay. that being said the facilities are great.    the outdoor pool is literally impossible to swim in as its too cold. breakfast in the morning is also great. the hotel is very family friendly.    Before booking the hotel we read a lot of reviews about how bad the service was we definitely didn't think we would experience it or would it affect our stay i guess we was wrong. based on our experience we would not recommend.    stayed from 6 march 2016 - 11 march 2016    P.S some staff did make our stay easier,Date of stay: March 2016,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/francoismouri
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,ShakeelaHanif wrote a review Mar 2016,10,There's nothing 'le grande' about it!!,Having just spoken to an extremely unhelpful guest relations manager who now that we have checked out feels it's unnecessary to assist us further I feel it prudent to write about our terrible experience whilst I sit in the savoy hotel lobby!!    Firstly some positives Fathima who assisted us in booking our excursions was lovely and helpful as was the waiter Abdel Jaleel. The driver Hamid who took us to the Atlas mountains was fabulous and made the excursion worthwhile and fun.    The negatives. As it's the winter the air conditioning was set to heat mode and as such we were unable to have cool air and the room was stifling. The solution we were told was to leave the balcony door open... at night... this did not make for a sound nights sleep and I don't feel it was particularly safe.    The excursion we booked to the medina was a complete waste of money the guide seemed disinterested and bored and despite having paid at the hotel we then had to pay seperately for each site we went to. Furthermore he took us to all the expensive shops in the souks! We got better bargains when we went back alone.    We were only able to eat in 2 out of the 3 restaurants advertised and although the Morrocon was good( it could have done with a more varied menu on the 3 separate occasions we ate there) the Italian(Alfredo) was dire. How they managed to crucify the simplest menu item-a margherita pizza is beyond my understanding.    Finally the guest relations manager needs some serious training in her role. She was devoid of sympathy and was defensive in her responses doing nothing to alleviate our negative view of this hotel.    In summary the savoy le grande is a 3* hotel at best disguising itself beneath the pretty veneer of a 5*.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,World traveler wrote a review Mar 2016,20,Maybe I was unlucky,"A previous reviewer stated that "" you would have to be stupid not to love this hotel"". Therefore i am either stupid or was just unlucky. Lets start with the positives: I got a great deal for both the flight and hotel when i arrived at the hotel the reception staff were friendly and courteous and i was given a complimentary mint tea ( very nice). I was able to access my room at 11am and the room was large with a lovely balcony and coffee making facilities (no milk or sugar!). The view from my balcony was over looking the nightclubs next to the Hotel. I noticed that i could not lock my balcony door and called housekeeping to get it fixed this was done almost immediately. I went to bed at about 10pm on the first night and was awake at about midnight with the sound of the music coming from the nightclubs next door. I eventually phoned reception at 3.15am to tell them they would have to give me another room in the morning. The music continued to 4.20 am! I was moved to a room overlooking the swimming pool ( the coldest pool i have ever known) the following day. I again had to call room service as the coffee machine did not work again this was fixed quickly. When i returned to the room in the early evening i was immediately hit with a strong smell of urine. After yet another call to house keepingthe bathroom was cleaned and the smell had gone but as i suspected this was only temporary. As i did not want to move rooms again i put up with the smell for the remainder of my stay. Maybe i was just unlucky but i wont be staying at this hotel again.",Date of stay: March 2016,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Greater London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Worldtravel54321
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,shorttriptraveller wrote a review Mar 2016,40,Value for money,Took a Fleetway Travel short break to The Savoy with my daughter and her friend and enjoyed it on the whole but with a few shortcomings.  One room was not available until 5.30 - not ideal if you have been up since 2am however when we got them both they were of a good size well equipped and with excellent bathroom.  The whole complex was impressive - 2 good outside pools with plenty of seating and a smaller inside one - all spotlessly clean well maintained and not too busy.  As we were on a package we were offered the use of 2 restaurants - The Moroccan one - smallish half board menu only tagines for mains but pleasant enough and The Italian Restaurant - much larger menu and a good meal - Breakfast was a large affair with enough choice to satisfy anyone.  As others have noted the staff although on the whole were very friendly and anxious to please seemed (especially in the restaurants) to lack much training and were very disorganised.  The Carrefour supermarket next door is useful for stocking up on soft drinks etc to avoid hotel prices and the new Mall is worth a look with a cigarette shop at the far end.  Its a relatively simple walk to Jemaa El Fna but not too pleasant - just hail a petit taxi from outside the Mall rather than at the hotel and HAGGLE - 40 Dirhams is about right but £0 is attainable!  All in all an enjoyable experience if you can get the hotel at a good price - they have a way to go and need to up their game on the staff front,Date of stay: March 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Knighton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shorttriptraveller
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Cathy B wrote a review Mar 2016,20,Good facilities but poor service,We stayed for three nights at this hotel. Our room was spacious and the facilities at the hotel were good. However the service was not what you would expect in an establishment which is billed as five star - for example waiting ages to be served drinks in the bar despite plenty of staff on duty same again waiting for tea and coffee at breakfast. Reception staff took an age to process any requests too.    Another disappointing issue was that we were on a half board deal and we were hoping to eat at each of the three restaurants during our stay. However one of the restaurants was only open to a conference party and not to the guests. While it meant we had a choice of two (Moroccan and Italian) these menus are extremely limited when you need gluten free food. We asked for rice or potatoes but the only carbohydrates on offer were bread pasta or cous cous - no good when you're a coeliac so we ended up very hungry! Staff did not seem to understand the term gluten free (despite us having notified hotel in advance and having brought typed up phrases explaining the condition in Arabic and French).,Date of stay: March 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cathybE8504CE
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,TerryandJane wrote a review Mar 2016,40,A Curates Egg - Good in parts.,WARNING: Take care at the airport we were mugged on arrival by a local grabbing our bags in baggage reclaim loading them on a trolley and 'helping' us. The local police seem to let locals in to the baggage reclaim (for a fee?) and do nothing to stop them grabbing bags. We had a driver and transfer waiting outside the arrivals hall so needed no help but for wheeling our bags less than 50 metres this local demanded English money to release our bags and he didn't ask nicely. DO NOT let anybody touch your badges in the baggage reclaim area unless you want to be mugged.  So The Savoy Hotel we want to love this place but really could only like it. A lot was really very good but too much wasn't for it to be fantastic or really a 5 star by western standards.  ROOMS: we had a suite which was enormous 65 sm. A dressing room off the bedroom two toilets large lounge and separate bedroom with the most enormous bed. So big though the sheets didn't fit and Han no overhang to tuck in they just lay on top of the mattress. Flash pod style coffee machine but it didn't do just hot water so couldn't have a cup of tea. Two English movie channels on TV plus normal 24 hour news. Large jacuzzi bath plus walk in rain shower BUT a giant picture window between bedroom and bathroom so absolutely no privacy. There was a thin blind in the bathroom but as soon as a light went on it became transparent. Good job there was a separate toilet off the hall way.  POOL: lovely pool and the first time I have had a memory foam mattress on a sun bed! Clean pool towels layer out on sunbeams each morning. Moov pool bar was terrible the service was slow and staff curt. The pool restaurant up the stairs and not the terrace was brilliant however. Staff friendly quick and helpful and we thought the best food in the hotel. Sadly only open for lunch.  FOOD: disappointing. Breakfast had a wide buffet selection and great fruit and yoghurt but the hot selection never was. Omelettes made to order though we're good. The Moroccan restaurant was amazing so beautiful with live Moroccan musician but the food was poor. Salad starter was good but the choice for main was tagine with chicken lamb or fish. No veggie options although I do cheat and eat some fish. Horrible though the fish was full of bones and the only vegetables in the tagine were tinned carrots and tinned peas. So disappointing. The Italian was a little better although there was a tendency to over cook and fish and chicken options were v dry. Pizza was nice. It also felt like this was a training establishment as the staff whilst very keen struggled to get anything right. We were on Half board so don't know if that impacted the quality of the food/menu we were offered. TIP: if on half board you can swap lunch for dinner.  BARS: the hotel was quiet so there was little atmosphere most of the time. Bogarts was nice but staff inexperienced and couldn't make cocktails although they did try the results were poor. There is a small stage for entertainment but that never happened the week we were there. The lobby bar off reception was much better with live piano music each night smart comfortable furnishings and quality cocktails served with generous complimentary nibbles nuts and olives. But then they have put a 50 inch tv slap bang in the middle showing back to back football. This attracted large groups of men who moved all the furniture and gathered around the to killing any atmosphere and turning a lovely up market cocktail bar in to a sports bar. Don't get me wrong I love the football but there is a time and place.  So overall we had a good time the weather was great and once we sorted out the best bits we were happy and might well return but not on half board and not expecting 5 stars.,Date of stay: March 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Torquay, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TerryandJane

One big minus from my end is that the Gym is open from 9 to 9 - meaning on a business trip: you have no access to the Gym at all as you have to work while its open.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,shteak wrote a review Mar 2016,40,Great value for Money; thought expect slight hiccups!,We booked this hotel after much deliberation booking 2 standard rooms for 4 people. Located a decent walk from al feena square a 5 star hotel that is very very new.    Things got off to a frosty start; we arrived at the front of the hotel and rather than the staff greet us or communicate they wanted to check out bags for security. Not the smoothest start. Once we were in we were told that our rooms were not ready till 3pm! Looking back thats understandable but we were tired and the last thing we wanted to hear was that we could visit the mall next door to pass time.    So whilst two of my friends were busy trying to get a room organised at the desk one of the girls was very kind in bringing us some tea and baklava/biscuits; a few rounds too!    Within half an hour they had managed to arrange one room for us and a 2nd they promised by 3pm latest. The rooms themselves were decent all the standard things you would expect. Decent decor sliding door cupboard and a balcony. At this point we realised it was imperative to get two adjacent rooms as the balconies would connect. Thankfully they gave us the room next door after our pleading with them. One of the safes in the room was not operating but they sorted that no problem fairly sharpish.    From this point on it was all plain sailing. Gym and Indoor pool facilities were put to good use. The hotel itself has lovely views within and a relaxed atmosphere.    The enjoyable buffet breakfast had all bases covered though as mentioned the tea/coffee was not always served promptly. Id put this down to a lack of experience from some staff maybe. On the last morning the hotel was kind enough to arrange 4 continental breakfasts to our room prior to our flight.    Overall was a top stay for us as for the price we paid you cannot go wrong! Hotel will make mistakes (like they loaded someones else's luggage onto our van when leaving!) but these mistakes maybe cut out in due course. As long as you can endure these slight hiccups you will be more than fine and have a fine stay.,Date of stay: February 2016,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Leicester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shteak

At breakfast the management has valued their fresh made orange juice as the most precious thing. They served only half glass of it when you asked a refill you got artificial juice from a ""refill jug"".  A big disappointment was the ""dinner for 2 web booking offer"" that we did not get at all.

There is a large supermarket next door if you don't fancy paying Savoy prices (£3.50 roughly for a can of coke!) We stayed for 4 nights and fortunately for the time of year the weather was lovely. There were no sun bed issues but I'm guessing that's because we went at a very quiet time.  Staff are friendly enough but to be honest I didn't feel the level of service was any different to 3 star hotels I've stayed in. At breakfast we often had to go and hunt for our coffee and tables were not restocked quickly. It would seem where you sit will determine how quickly you are noticed and served. We found sitting outside stopped the need for hunting our own coffees and teas.  Had a few issues such as our room being allocated to another person while we were still occupying it! A pin had been left in the throw that goes over the bed and I ended up cutting my leg on it. We were compensated for both these problems and we were happy with that.  All in all a lovely hotel and I probably would stay here again.,Date of stay: February 2016,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Crawley, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeanaLondon

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Victoria R wrote a review Feb 2016,30,Good facilities but some improvements to be made,We booked this hotel as we wanted a luxurious hotel in Marrakech. There are definitely positives about the hotel but some areas that can be improved.    The lobby and rooms are of very good quality. The facilities are top notch although it is a shame that the jacuzzi is not free for guests. Generally the hotel staff are very friendly especially the concierge who helped us book restaurants and taxis. The spa staff were hostile and did not inform us that we had to pay for the jacuzzi initially and tried to charge us on our way out. This led to us making a complaint to the manager who waived the fee luckily. On our second visit to the indoor pool which was free we were treated in an unfriendly manner when they told us our bathrobes from our room had to be handed in and were not ours to use. After another complaint to the manager we received a food package and free use of the jacuzzi.    The breakfast is continental and not ideal for those who prefer hot breakfast where the quality wasn't as great. There is a lot of choice from traditional Moroccan food to western. Service however differs entirely depending on where you sit in the restaurant (waited five minutes for drinks inside and an hour when we sat outside!). Some of the staff make an extra effort with guests - the cleaners left a Valentine's Day display in our room and a porter walked us under an umbrella to the room.    Generally there are no issues with getting sun beds although we did go at a quiet time of year. The room we had was a family bed with two double beds although we should have been given a king deluxe room (they were apparently all booked).    The location is good. It is a half an hour walk to the centre of the old town and half an hour from centre of the ville nouvelle. It is a great place to relax outside the business of the city. The only downside is the nightclubs next door as depending on where your room is located you can hear music playing throughout the night.,Date of stay: February 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VictoriaR35

Unknown to us she informed the general manager and when we returned to our room that night we found the most gorgeous birthday cake and rose petals scattered carefully all around!! What an absolutely fabulous surprise. The chief concierge Mehdi could not have been friendlier or more helpful nothing was too much trouble for him. The outdoor swimming pools were just amazing such lovely surroundings to relax in. The reception staff were also lovely.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Adam N wrote a review Feb 2016,50,Savoy le grand hotel Marrakech,My first visit to this beautiful city and it was very pleasant along with this great hotel. The staff working in this hotel are very professional in their workvery polite and also very helpful specially Mehdi and his team who are on the first desk as you enter from the main door. From the time we checked in till the time we checked out we had great service and we would call them many times yet they have never refused to help. Some minority of the staff may need to revise on their manners and how they conduct with customers.  The breakfast lounge can improve on being organised eg the cutlery should be placed on the table such as plates and glasses or if not then it should be made visible and quicker to find.  The room service is pretty slow to be fair and they should deliver quicker or maybe inform the customer on how long it'll take.    Overall I enjoyed the stay here and I would highly recommend people to stay here.  I would definitely visit again and stay here again.    For those who have interest in night life SO club is the place to be as they play good English music. Avoid w club next door. Buddha bar is good for a cocktail or a quick drink.

Hotel Manager Mahdi -provided us with exceptional customer service ensuring our stay was as pleasant as possible- very professional and down to earth manager who would ensure that everything was top class even in his absence - being 4 girls first time in Marrakech we were slightly worried it could be a bit much for us - and it could easily have been had we made the decision to stay elsewhere - the hotel consists of an all halal menu with 2 restaurants adjoined - a salon  spa and 2 outdoor pools and 1 indoor pool - could easily get lost in the hotel :) . We booked our excursions from the hotel - which enabled us to have a fun filled hassle free day with everything arranged for you - pick up and drop off to hotel - for this I would also like to mention Sufian and Rachid who were the go to guys for any tourist information and booking sightseeing tours - because of them we were able to fit in Hot Air Ballooning  Camel and quad biking  jet skiing and not to forget a day of shopping in the medina - hotel was so stunning we also spent a day lounging at the Savoy enjoying their spa/salon treatments - would highly recommend a relaxant massage  which nearly put me to sleep. I celebrated my 25th birthday during my stay and after a long day of shopping at the medina I was surprised by a cake and flowers in my room which I couldn't thank the hotel enough for as it really was such a memorable moment and also such a sweet thought from the hotels part - last but not least a special mention for one of the hotel workers Jamal- Jamal is part of the concierge team and was the first face we saw when arriving - I couldn't praise him enough - his customer service was second to none and I could honestly say that he was one of the highlights of our holiday !! Thankyou Savoy le Grand Hotel Marrakech staff for an unforgettable stay .. Highly recommend for families  as a romantic break or like us for anyone wanting a 5* holiday throughout .

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,brunos_mummy wrote a review Feb 2016,10,overall disappointing...,I think we were very unlucky to stay at this hotel at the same time as they were hosting a major conference. The sad thing was that to ensure the conference ran smoothly other guests needs were ignored.  I had hoped this would improve as the conference passed but this did not. We were staying as Half board guest the hotel very much made us feel like second class citizens. Following a complaint about poor quality the staff went overboard to the point of being patronizing and rude.  Nothing was correct the room had many minor issues which for a new five star establishment was not good sign (handles falling off toilet seats broken room service trays not collected. sure signs of a lack of attention..) there was also almost constant building work going on as soon as the high profile conference guests left.  The Concierge Staff were helpful although being told to eat around the meat as a vegetarian was not positive! Medhi (concierge) who gets very positive reviews on this site definitely lives up to the legend and did make attempts to help with our ongoing concerns.  Our experience of the Italian restaurant was very poor: the Morroccan much much better and the service better also.  I found reception staff unhelpful being told to go and speak to someone else by a woman playing with her phone and to top it all the our bill took three attempts to get right and was still wrong.  the hotel has some lovely design features and the hamman was lovely. The Wi-fi throughout is great: although we had to ask for the code.,Date of stay: January 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Canterbury, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brunos_mummy
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Yaseen_94 wrote a review Feb 2016,50,Yaseen- best in marakech,The Savoy Le Grand was the first and only hotel booked after recommendation. The hotel is the best hotel in Marrakech not only with the facilities but the excellent service from all the staff from the General manager to the house-keeping team.    The staff were great we felt like being at home within a few minutes of arriving. They were accommodating to our every request and really looked after us. The service was of very high quality the Savoy was very clean and appointed to a high standard. The breakfast was great with a a variety of foods. The outdoor pool was amazing also the indoor pool and spa area.    Location wise the hotel is situated in the perfect area of Medina. The Menara mall is situated seconds from the hotel with a food quarter with choices from around the world. The hotel offers prestige cars the best you will see in Marrakech.    Finally i would like to thank all the staff for there hard work and hospitality during my stay. I would highly recommend a trip to Marrakech and particularly Savoy as a must stay hotel in Marakech.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Rosemeen Y wrote a review Feb 2016,50,Exceeded our expectations,Going on our first holiday without any planning we were a bit nervous about our trip of three days . However from the moment we walked in up and until we left we have the best service from all members of staff ranging from the security to the cleaners  however namely : Mehdi sufiyaan  rachid and our boy Jamal were the ones we would always go to for help when needed !  The hotel helped us plan all the excursions  arranged people to collect and drop us to the locations  timing was always good and whenever we came back they asked about how our stay was and made us feel a part of their team . They advised us of anything we were unsure of and informed us of all the best places to eat . The breakfast bar and indoor pool was amazing however the spa treatments were very relaxing but they should have been more readily available with more staff working on the shifts !!  We would definitely use the savoy again especially due to the personalised service we felt we received !!!,Date of stay: February 2016,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rosemeeny
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Savin S wrote a review Feb 2016,40,Overall good stay with slight niggles,Had a very good stay for 5 nights in this hotel.  Professional airport pickup with cold towels efficient check-in with mint tea on arrival & swiftly taken to our room. Didn’t have a great start to our stay as the room was too hot on the first day because of A/C not working and the sliding doors didn’t lock properly.  However when this was reported to reception the next day Ms.Hajjir ( sorry-not sure I got the name right) a room changed was given without hesitation and our belongings were moved to the new room while were out. From then onwards things went perfect for us for the rest of the stay.  Staff were very friendly professional and always happy to help. Very big rooms and had a turn down service as well. The pool & bar was very spacious and had an elegant feel to it even though water was too cold for us. They do have heated pool which we didn’t venture into as this I believe had a supplement. Breakfast selection was elaborate with wide variety the fresh orange juice they serve is one of the best I ever had.  Lot of building works going on inside & around the hotel so you can hear constant drilling noise during the day. The rooms comes with coffee maker only but kettle and tea bags were provided upon request but they didn’t have any milk sachets   I would definitely return.,Date of stay: February 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/savins2016
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Mouse00 wrote a review Feb 2016,40,Very good value... with some let downs,First of all this hotel represents extremely good value for the high standard of service mostly received however my stay was let down by loud building works and with a young child sleeping in the day this was quite annoying. The only restaurant open most evenings was the Italian which was average quality and not a very extensive menu. The room service again a small menu had a better standard of cuisine. There were no activities/play areas for children despite it being advertised as child friendly. There was no children's menu and it was frustrating having to order an adults portion to feed my toddler. Unfortunately I did not like the food here but I did not get to try the Moroccan restaurant. Breakfast staff were always very friendly. I enjoyed the coffee and juice but I'm not a big breakfast eater so can't comment on food but there was pastries fruit omelettes etc    The pools were a great size but freezing cold at this time of year not pleasant to swim in - other hotels have heated outdoor pools for this season.    The spa front desk staff on the occasion I booked a massage were quite rude and uninterested in the client. I felt they felt like they were doing me a favour by being there. They really let my spa experience down was a shame as the massage was nice and the spa therapist although spoke only French was very nice. Front desk need some customer service training from the main hotel reception as they were always very polite and happy to help.    All the staff (apart from the spa) I came across were friendly and said hello to my daughter which was really nice.    Just a shame building work was going on but I was offered to move to a different room and the management wanted to help me (drilling seemed to be happening everywhere in rooms and around pool area).    In conclusion this is a nice hotel with very good size rooms that are cleaned to a good standard every day with a turn down service. The travel cot I was provided with was very good quality. The bed was large. The staff were friendly and helpful and I have no doubt without the noisy building work this would be a nice place to stay.    In particular Mohammed who worked in Rocks bar was very charming and helpful.,Date of stay: February 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mouse00
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Mariam M wrote a review Feb 2016,50,Absolute pleasure staying here!!!,I came here with my family and my little 10 month old nephew. The minute we walked into the hotelwe were delighted to see how spotless and new it looked. It definitely looked like a 5 star hotel. It was very busy as an conference was taking place. Mehdi the manager greeted us and as we had a mishap with our bookinghe accommodated us to our needs straight away....as a token of appreciation for booking our stay at Savoy Mehdi offered to upgrade our rooms to a luxury apartment suite consisting of 2 rooms2 bathrooms a toilet and a lounge area for the rest of our stay for free!! We were offered fruit snacks and regular top ups of water. The hospitality we were received was very good by Mehdi the manager Mohammad and Mehdi the concierge...however there were a few delays in service which is understandable as a conference of big scholars and lecturers was taking place over the 2 days. Nonetheless we enjoyed ourselves booked ourselves in for spa treatments which are quite dear (but expect that from hotels)and breakfast was very good. Tip: make sure to sit inside for brekki as you get served much quicker than sitting outside. Exploring marrakech you are situated 10 mins away from the airport but do visit Gueliz (you've got the malls cafes and shops) Jamaa el fna is on the stretch where H&m and Zara is....it can take up to 30mins walk and 5 mins taxi. When in the square be careful as some Moroccans like to con tourist especially when you get lost in the alleyways and do not give in to giving money when one gives you directions...ignore them and find your own way out!! Try the tagines and fresh orange juice....we also booked a private taxi for the whole day out to Agadir which cost us £120.    Tip: exchange your money at the currency converters on the Gueliz stretch or withdraw your money at once so you get charged the once but you are offered the best rates compared to the airport  Taxis have a meter running but u can always haggle before you get in...large taxis 50 dirhams and small 30 max,Date of stay: January 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Manchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariammohammed14
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,anasadam wrote a review Feb 2016,50,AWESOME HOTEL IN THE CENTRE OF MARRAKECH!!!,Originally booked a different hotel and went to the Savoy to have a look as i am in the Travel industry and wanted to take a few pictures and meet the management.    Younes showed me around and i booked 2 nights straight away.    The hotel is in a wonderful location 5 mins away from the Jama El Fna and next to the Menara mall where you will find lots of restaurants and things to do for the children.    The staff are great especially Zara and Younes who really looked after us and not to forget Oualid who was always there when ever we needed something.    We were upgraded to the Executive suite and given a pool view room. The room was faultless which had a huge bathroom lounge and a Jacuzzi.    The breakfast was great too lots of choices of fresh fruit croissants eggs pancakes and so many more items which i can't remember now.    The hotel has an indoor and outdoor pool. We did use the indoor pool which was very relaxing and it was great after a busy day in the souks and sight seeing.    Since my return i have been heavily promoting this hotel as i cannot fault it. I will recommend this to anyone. I want to thank all the staff at the Savoy who made our stay truly memorable and a really big thank you to Zara Younes and Oualid.    I will be returning again in the near future!,Date of stay: December 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anasadam
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,sehgalsa wrote a review Feb 2016,40,Nice property with few issues,The hotel is new and rooms are good. We stayed in a suite which was huge.  The rest of the hotel is also huge and has nice public areas and pools. The staff is also friendly. Plus there is a mall - Menara right next to the hotel which has a supermarket and few cafes and a fountain which is a crowd puller.    Its in the new part of the town and quite close to the Medina. A taxi there should cost around 30 Dirhams.    Breakfast in the hotel was good- a wide spread. The fresh orange juice that they serve with the breakfast was one of the best I have had.    However there are few areas where the hotel can improve  There are no tea/ coffee making facilities in the rooms. There is a Lavazza coffee machine in the room but no sugar/creamer or even water to fill the machine. Its only on the third day that they put some water in the room.    Lack on consistency in other areas. On checking in one of the WCs had a sanitised paper band around it but the other was missing it. There is a turn-down service but it was provided on 2 days out of the 4 that we stayed in the hotel.,Date of stay: January 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sehgalsa

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Rosie A wrote a review Feb 2016,50,One of the best hotels ever!,Got a bargain booking for this amazing hotel! Booked one suite for 3 people which was more than adequate. However initially our room was garden side where works were being carried out as the area is still being developed (which is a good thing as Marrakech is on the up!). On our first night there was also a bit of noise coming from the security guards outside. We were OK with this but the next morning management insisted we moved to a poolside room and gave us another great room! Thank you to the Deputy Manager for her great hospitality along with all the staff who were so lovely!    We had an amazing time and I wouldn't have wanted to stay anywhere else. Having visited Marrakech previously this time out holiday was A LOT better because of Savoy Le Grand! The Spa is great and the breakfasts are FANTASTIC! So much fresh food and all the stations provide so much choice! The service is next to none!    The outside pool is so tranquil and the atmosphere is great. The music isn't too loud during the day but provides a great setting for relaxing. You feel like you're at a resort rather than a hotel. With a mall supermarket restaurants and clubs less than a few seconds away this is possibly the best location to stay at!    The only negative was that the Spa Pool could have been slightly warmer as the outside pool was so cold at this time of year. Also less chlorine! Also if you are booking excursions it's best to book in the medina (Jemaa el-fnaa) as it's far more affordable. Other than that we were so so sad to leave. Definitely rate it more than 5 stars!    Anyone who complains about this hotel is an idiot.    We would love to stay here again! ❤️,Date of stay: December 2015,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rosiea490
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,rza3000 wrote a review Jan 2016,50,New Hotel that's beautiful but be patient they are still new.,The hotel itself is gorgeous and for what we paid an absolute bargain!! We booked directly with the hotel and I'm glad we did!    There were a couple of minor issues but I took the fact that they rectified these immediately and that they are a new team into consideration.  Mehdi will sort any issue out with a smile!!    With it being off season we pretty much had sauna hot tub and pool to ourselves which was strange but very nice!!    The hotel is right next to a shopping mall which is still being filled but has a fully stocked Carrefour supermarket which is very convenient.    You are also walking distance from the old Marrakech and new Marrakech or around 40MAD or roughly €4 by a petit taxi but we walked around 15-20mins to both the new side and old side. Which is perfect as your out of the hustle but close enough to walk.    Your also less than 10min walk to the trendy bars and restaurants. And Buddhabar is a 30second walk.    We stayed in a suite the bed was very comfortable the pillows weren't perfect but not a massive issue. Awesome balcony with beatific view of the pool and Marrakech. It had a Jet tub with shower a double shower cubicle with rain body and hand held showers.  Two WC's which helps if the food was hot.    Two TVs one by the bed the other by the comfortable sofa. Sliding doors to split lounge and bedroom which helps if you sleep with a snorer that you need to kick out of bed which my wife has to on a regular basis!  Lavazza espresso machine with pods.    Pros  Location (close to airport and major parts of Marrakech)  Room quality and size  Bathroom  Beauty of the hotel    Cons  They are new so still finding their feet but rectify issues immediately.

It was also my wife kims birthday on the 9th nov and one of the staff called (FATIMA) arranged a surprise birthday cake for her which they brought to our room which was such a kind thing for them to do.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Shah S wrote a review Jan 2016,10,Terrible Hotel. Avoid this hotel.,"A friend and I had stayed at Savoy Le Grand Hotel from 25 - 30 September 2015.    We were particularly looking forward to our stay at the hotel. We were initially inclined to stay at other hotels within the vicinity of Central Marrakech however after careful thought we felt that Savoy's service would best meet our requirements. However we were deeply saddened and disappointed with our stay at the hotel.    We were the recipients of such poor service and negativity from incompetent staff.    Details below;    1. Poor level of service from staff members.    Staff members were were extremely unprofessional in their manner and general etiquette towards us. We were the recipients of such poor service right from the very beginning of our holiday. This included check in staff staff at the bar breakfast lounge staff and health club staff. In short we felt like unwelcome guests and felt uncomfortable as a result of their blunt and rude behaviour which drew attention from fellow guests.    2. The poor service at the breakfast lounge and the limited range of food.    We were informed of the breakfast timetable. It was a sheer disappointment to see the limited range in food despite going there early. Furthermore I noticed a lot of flies around the food area. This was extremely concerning to say the least and raised questions about the hygiene.    3. The rooms were not cleaned.    Despite requesting room service on numerous occasions that we wished our room to be cleaned on a daily basis it was merely cleaned on two occasions.    4. The poor service that my friend had received at the massage spa.    My friend paid to have a quality service massage. He was informed that it is a 5* massage spa for which he agreed. He was ushered to the changing room with no forthcoming information about the programme. He waited for 10-15 minutes in the changing room assuming someone will come back and advise him about the programme accordingly to no avail. He then went to the reception area of the health club and noticed 2 staff members having a casual conversation. He spoke to one of the staff members and stated that he has been waiting for almost 15 minutes for someone to advise him about the programme to which one of the staff member bluntly replied ""we are waiting for you here."" He stated is this the level of service Savoy hotel offers its guest? A renowned name in the travel and hospitality industry offering such poor service below the threshold level. His mood had completely been put off to proceed with the massage but as he had already agreed he opted to proceed as planned but he was left unsatisfied with both the service and the programme.    5.The poor service offered by the pool staff and bar staff in the pool.    On several different occasions we had requested drinks also assistance from the pool staff - despite the hotel had very few guests staying we were made to wait at least 30 minutes on each occasion for our request to be fulfilled. This was wholly inadequate and unjust for a ""5 star"" hotel.    upon our return back to London I had sent countless emails to the hotel regarding our dissatisfaction. The hotel staff have completely ignored and chose not to respond to my complaint. I had emailed the General Manager - Ashraf Wahba and various other individuals/sections to no avail. This is a testimony of their level of service and incompetence. I guess they are just after your money and only that. Please avoid spending your hard earned money in this hotel. If you want an actual 5 star hotel and service I would advise you to stay at Sofitel Marrakech.",Date of stay: September 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/31shahs

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,R S wrote a review Jan 2016,30,Long review ahead - would i stay or would i go?,We didn't initially receive our request and check in was a 3 hour process - not a warm welcome especially after a long flight.    SPA service was not up to standard. We booked a hammam and massage and it was continuously disturbed by the workers talking and laughing (during a massage). Not a great experience especially for the price.    They arranged a quad bike hour trip for two with travel included for 1500 MAD (150 euros) - highly recommended.    We didn't try the restaurants based on the spa service sorry. Complimentary breakfast was good.    Rooms were cleaned twice a day although never moped.    We met the infamous Mehdi on our last night in this hotel which was unfortunate. He is a pleasant fellow who helped us with our dining experience and our departure back home.    Checkout was better and after we shared our concerns about our check in experience one of the managers drove us to the airport - a nice touch. Mehdi also helped with the immigration cards.    TIPS:  Go directly to the front desk and avoid the telephone if you want something done.  Excellent hotel as it's close to a carefour (supermarket) and cafes  Close to airport  Loud music played at night..with a heavy bass so not ideal if you are a light or early sleeper.  Coffee maker is a nice touch.  Ask the hotel for taxis and the expected fare prices.

The chief concierge (Mehdi) and his team were first class and made our experience trouble and stress free. On our final day my wife and I decided to travel and discover the City without the help of the concierge services. Mehdi offered a car from the hotel to take us where we wanted to for the day free of charge as it was our anniversary. Thank you Mehdi the gesture was much appreciated.    The hotel is is truly 5 star with amazing internal decoration and fittings. All the staff were very friendly attentive and competent.

We liked the approx. 2km walk to the Medina but if you plan to discover the city during the whole day you will rack up quite a distance so it might be a good idea to take a taxi if you're not used to walk long-ish distances.  In the near vicinity of the hotel there is not much to do nor are there many restaurants. If you want to have a large selection you have to go the city center. The adjacent Menara Mall is not worth visiting.  During our stay the hotel was not very busy. The service was irreproachable.  We had an Executive Suite with pool view that was very clean and spacious with a nice bathroom.  We strongly recommend the breakfast! There is a nice buffet and the poolside tables are really nice. It might get a bit crammed during high-season when the hotel is fully booked though.  Everything was as advertised. We would come back and we can recommend the Savoy le Grand Hotel.,Date of stay: December 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Switzerland,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/30beatr
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,pittman64 wrote a review Jan 2016,40,Very Swanky Hotel with Some Small Hiccups,Stayed at his hotel for three nights with family over the New Year. The property is beautiful and has a wonderful atmosphere to it; pretty lobby pools and restaurants. The rooms are nice with cool amenities and a comfy bed(s). Also the pool to include the indoor and spa / hot tub are wonderful.    Pros: on-site parking with security friendly and helpful staff comfy beds big rooms huge rainfall showers balcony great breakfast fun pool and hot tub and extremely close to restaurants and the Menara Mall.    Cons: wifi was spotty and slow (albeit free) our fridge did not get cold shower drain clogged easily sliding glass door did not lock without adjusting the door which took several minutes and the AC units were turned off due to it being winter (even though it's unseasonable warm in Marrakech).    The biggest issue with the hotel room was the AC not working; we arrived to find the rooms overly toasty as in at least 80 degrees. This was mainly due to the angle of the sun and the blinds being open. When we attempted to turn the AC on it blew heat and the hotel informed us that they do not operate on separate units like traditional Western hotels but the entire hotels AC unit operates as a whole so it's only turned on in the summer. Marrakech was unseasonable warm so it would have been nice to know this ahead of time. Also the only window to open to let cool air in was the sliding glass door which is OK but somewhat insecure because other rooms connect via the balcony thus someone could enter the room if the door is left open.    We were informed the hotel was recently remodeled and that some of the cons I've mentioned may just be little issues that need worked out (except for the AC). This just something to be aware of regarding expectations of a high end hotel.    Overall the hotel is very nice and we enjoyed the hospitality. We will return but hope some of these small issues will be resolved. The AC issue is not necessarily a problem because it pertains to winter months but is merely awareness for other travelers who go to Marrakech when it's during winter but possibly very warm.,Date of stay: January 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pittman64
Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Megan B wrote a review Dec 2015,50,Amazing Hotel and Location,Staying at this hotel for our work Christmas party from the moment we stepped out of the airport to the moment we returned the service and experience was excellent. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful breakfast was delicious and the rooms were incredible. Such a great location being a short walk to the Medina and restaurants. I went on a camel riding trip recommended by the hotel and it was great fun - picked up and dropped off at the hotel. The spa was a great bonus and we made use of the indoor pool and saunas (the outdoor pool was a little bit cold as it was December!)

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Safinad2014 wrote a review Dec 2015,50,Amazing stay highly recommend,Recently came back from a 3 night stay in the Savoy Le Grande. You really are treated like royalty for the moment you get there and throughout your stay. All the staff are brilliant and cannot do enough for you. The first impression of how you will be treated is given by the hotel porters at the front of the hotel . You could not ask for a more warm and pleasant welcome. Staff are always smiling and happy .  The spa is amazing and one of the best I've been to so if you can make sure you give it a try.  The breakfast buffet was beautiful with plenty of choice and fresh produce . Again the staff were polite welcoming and always smiling  Younis organized a sight seeing trip for us on our last day with our own chauffeur driven car which was brilliant and gave us the chance to explore Marrakesh without having to worry about taxis and travel.  Would highly recommend this hotel if you want a holiday feeling pampered and spoilt . I will definitely be staying here again on my next visit to Marrakesh.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Stephanie R wrote a review Dec 2015,40,An honest review .. Great Service & would return ..,The service in this hotel was fantastic nothing was too much trouble for the staff and they made every guest feel super welcome we had an Executive Suite which was great although the view was a little too be desired as there is still a small amount of building work going on which started around 8am during our stay. (I think this would only effect a few rooms on this side of the hotel) Also could do with a few decent TV channels as very limited for UK guests (I don't travel to Marrakech to watch TV but my little one has an afternoon nap and with no view from the room and the weather being chilly on the odd day it would of gone down well to have a few more channels) You may already know the hotel has only been open a few months and therefore there are a few areas that need to be finalised before it's a full 5*    The Food in the Alfredo restaurant was great and really good value ..  The Spa was of 5* quality  The decor in the hotel is also top notch  It's only a 15 minute walk to the square and there are a few restaurants to the right hotel but more like upmarket cafes rather than restaurants  Next door is Buddha Bar which we didn't go too as had a 1 year old but feedback from other guests was great.  Breakfast is more than continental and offered a perfect range from omelettes to top notch pastries  Indoor pool x2 Great size although feel more could be done to create a luxury feel as the bright orange sun loungers and full basement feel slightly lets it down  The food on the terrace at the outdoor pool was fantastic and oh what a view ..  The mall next door was as others said a let down for adults but a kids dream.. Perfect for kids aged 3 - 14  Overall I would return to this hotel as it's the ideal distance from the Medina and its staff make it stand out from other hotels ..

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Neil D wrote a review Dec 2015,50,Feel like Royalty !,Firstly I am still staying at this hotel for a further 3 days but wanted to write a review now then another on check out.  I booked this hotel through hotels.com as it was a bargain compared to other 5 star hotels in Marrakech. I mean I would have loved the Royal Mansour but at £500 plus a night its wasn't an option.  I emailed in advance and arranged with the wonderful head concierge man ( Mehdi ) to ask about arranging some trips which he did. I also booked the limousine service from the airport through him at £20. I was met in a luxury Mercedes with a suited driver and Mehdi. There were rose petaled cold towels and chilled mineral water for me in the car ( only a 10 minute ride )  On arrival EVERYONE knew my name. I was whisked through reception and given mint tea and pasties whilst Mehdi organised everything . I felt like a superstar !  The hotel is very new and during the day can look a little like a concrete block BUT it is next door to a big mall for shopping and several top notch restaurants. There were so many staff cleaning 24/7 - it is spotless !  A receptionist on arrival immediately took my mobile and popped in the code for free wifi which is super fast and free in every part of the building  A few maintenance men doing repairs were very discrete  My 1st floor ( room 1215 ) was an executive room with separate lounge dressing area huge bedroom two large TVs and massive jacuzzi bathroom. Spotless and filled with lovely extras such as fresh fruit pasties nuts and mini bar.  The first two days were spent in the limosine arrange by Mehdi with driver and tout guide. I did the atlas mountains one day and the whole of the city the next day. I recommend this 100% as you dont need to stress about taxis and people hagggeling you and not getting lost in the markets. I saw everything and the gide knew everything. We did Palace Bahia Mosques Yves Saint Laurents garden and all the squares markets and souks So many photo opportunties !  One of the biggest credits to the hotel management is the staff. EVERY memberand I mean EVERY member is charming polite speaks English and cannot do enough.EVERYONE called me Mr Neil - which is lovely and remembered quickly my preferences to food and drink. Even the cleaners stop and say hello.  The breakfast room is huge and amazing - there's something for everyone -breakfast by the pool with a huge hot and cold buffet was just fabulous. you can have omelettes made in front of you or just graze the massive selection. You really don't need lunch afterwards !  There are a great selection of bars and restaurants in house but try the amazing Buddha bar next door - a palace of Asian cuisine - which is mind blowing. Not cheap but two of us ate so much with wine and cocktails for just under £100 - you can eat cheaper !  Today was spent by the pool with a towel boy on hand to help and waiter service for drinks -the drinks are really cheap for a 5 star property  Cant find fault right now - and normally I do. Well two niggles ! The pianist in the cocktail bar is hard work ( plays all the classics badly ! ) it is almost comedy as he keeps hitting the wrong notes ! And the cocktail barman could do with a few lessons in making the perfect cocktail. He tried a few but weren't great - but a charming man and they serve plates of free canapes with drinks !!  Three more days to go and the overall impression is clearly the Europeans are staying away from Muslim countries which baffles me as EVERYONE I have met at the hotel and outside have been warm charming and genuinely pleased to see you.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Polly B wrote a review Dec 2015,50,Fantastic hotel with lovely and helpful staff,Spent 4 nights here with my brother. On arrival we were welcomed by the reception staff and given mint tea. Our room was upgraded for free which was a lovely surprise. The room was fantastically beautiful. It was on the ground floor and could be opened out into the main pool area. The bedroom was spacious and comfy. The bathroom was spotless - amazingly clean. We had an issue with the bathroom door not locking but this was sorted out almost immediately.  The breakfast buffet was fantastic. A tasty selection of food with made to order omlettes.  The hotel concierge service were fantastic - they organised 2 lovely days out (one day of exploring atlas mountains and the other of camel riding and quad biking in the desert). The reception staff were always welcoming friendly and happy to help. They were always smiling and ensuring we had no issues. Our rooms were cleaned twice a day with a turn dowm service at night.  The hotel is right next to the mall and walking distance to the main square.  On checking out we were taken to the airport in a lovely hotel car. The staff waved us off in such a lovely manner.  My stay here has been fantastic. I was made to feel like royalty throughout. The hotel was a haven of peace after my action packed days out!

We stayed in this hotel for 4 nights and week day and week end sleep was impossible. There is a nightclub next to the hotel and the loud music starts from midnight and ends in the morning. This should not be listed as a 5* hotel. I would think a restful sleep is a basic requirement of any hotel. The banging music left us sleepless with our ears ringing and migraines.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,MissRani wrote a review Dec 2015,50,A Great Hotel,I stayed at this hotel last week and overall I was very impressed. The hotel has only been open a few months so everything is brand spanking new. A comfortable stay. The rooms were nice and clean and the pool view made it even better. There is a lovely SPA within the hotel and I must say this was one of the best SPA's I have been to the ambiance the décor the overall feel was just perfect. The breakfast Buffet is also very good so much to choose from. There are also restaurants and a shopping mall with an equivalent of Tesco/Asda next to the hotel so that was a bonus. A bank was also with a 2 min walk. Right next door there was the Buddha Bar the first one in Africa.  Finally I must mention the staff who were all very good. Youness was very helpful he even gave us a tour of the hotel on the buggy/cart saved us walking around. He arranged a day outing with a local guide who took us to the Majorelle Gardens(beautiful gardens) Jemaa el-Fna square and the souks. I must say don't attempt the souks without a guide. My Rashid(My- is shortened for his name) was also very helpful he arranged a Driver to take us to the Atlas Mountains and even arranged at last minute for me to have some pounds changed into Dirhams. Then there was Mehdi who we had read about on Trip advisor and can see why. All in all very helpful staff who make your stay that bit more enjoyable.

Savoy Le Grand Hotel,Minna B wrote a review Nov 2015,50,Wonderful stay,This was our first but not last visit to Marrakech. I had booked 6 nights in a Riad in Medina that had good reviews on TA. Right away as we arrived to our Riad we realised it wasn't for us. Very small in the poor area of the city lacking privacy no pool no TV and still 85 euros per night with breakfast. We did not feel comfortable. I immediately started looking for another place to save our vacation.  Again on TA I found a brand new hotel Savoy in Hivernage and we took a taxi to see the hotel. Despite our very casual attire we were warmly welcomed and we immediately felt like we had found a perfect place. We moved out of Riad on the 3rd day of our stay couldn't get a refund but preferred to save our vacations than stay somewhere where we didn't felt comfortable.  We paid double the room rate what we were charged at Riad but you can not even compare the two! This time we had large room with two big and very comfortable beds large tv amazing large walk in shower beautiful brand new hotel with everything you wish for and most of all: wonderful service. As we had not planned to stay in a fancy hotel we had not packed any nice clothes. Despite our sports attire we were treated like royalty. The staff was genuinely caring and always available to please.  The property is brand new it has wonderful large pool enjoying the sunshine all day long. There is another pool on the other side of the building which we did not go to and indoor heated pools in the spa where we had a free access to. There is a top of the line gym with a view to the pool and TV's free to our access. The breakfast buffet (included in our room rate) had everything you could wish to eat at breakfast well presented and served with smile.  We didn't dine at any of the restaurants on site but had drinks at the hotel bar before heading out and I want to congratulate the service at the bar. The staff was wonderful every department of the hotel but I particularly enjoyed chatting with the bar staff. The prices in the bar are very reasonable considering this being a 5 star property. We had a same bottle of wine at the Buddha Bar next door for 380 d where as our hotel charged for it only 220!  I cannot recommend this hotel enough. I wonder WHY I was recommended to stay at Riad when coming to Marrakech when you can live so close to Medina and it's interesting but way too busy streets when you can stay in the luxurious hotel with all the amenities and great service and walk 10 minutes to see the crowds in Medina.  Our son particularly enjoyed the Menara Mall which is right next door and it's two full floors of Kid's Zone where he could play video games at his heart's content.  Thanks to the wonderful staff the beautiful property of Savoy le Grand Hotel our vacation became very relaxing we felt spoiled and went home happy and refreshed.,Date of stay: October 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Robion, France",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MinnaVancouver

As a newly opened 5 star hotel we had high expectations of what was to come.    Unfortunately the hotel is still having a few teething problems - but I am sure once these have been sorted this will be a great place to stay and worth of its 5 stars.    The pool is lovely comfy sun loungers and plenty of shade when you need to retreat from the sun. It's a great chill out place after a morning in the souks.    The pool restaurant is ok. Not the best food for the price they charge but perfectly fine.
