Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Jon272 wrote a review Jul 2022,50,A Hotel for all Seasons,My partner and I opted out of staying at a traditional Riad in the Medina in favour of five star luxury on the outskirts of Marrakech. We wondered whether we had made the right choice.  All our fears were allayed from the moment we arrived through the huge secure private iron gates up the sweeping drive and into a magnificent air-conditioned welcome.  This chain understands service! In our week's long stay we had absolutely no issues whatsoever - just a fantastic stay being waited on hand and foot.  Our Premier Garden Terrace Room was superbly appointed with double sliding doors to the large bathroom and double doors to the huge terrace. When all opened up the room is to say the least - impressive!  The public rooms are also magnificent and thoughtfully finished in traditional yet modern Moorish style.  The breakfast is expensive (as is all the food) but exceptionally good. By the side of the hotel is a newly-opened retail street with shops restaurants and even Christiano Ronaldo's boutique hotel. This is an option for a great breakfast too.  The adult pool area is an oasis of calm although occasionally children did sneak in to go in the pool with their parents and nothing was said. The hotel grounds and gardens are so beautiful and relaxing that they almost rival the famous Yves Saint Laurent Gardens!  Being slightly detached from the hub of activity in the main town was not a problem - a taxi from the hotel cost between £5-£10 depending on the integrity of the driver!  Thank the Lord for Abdul who was the greatest gift to taxis since Uber and had to be almost forced to take payment from us! If anyone needs his number please let me know.  In summary whatever the season (or reason) this hotel excelled. Thank you.,Date of stay: July 2022,,"Altrincham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jon272
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Simon B wrote a review Mar 24,40,A very beautiful place,We had a 3rd floor suite with garden and Atlas mountain views. A nice welcome birthday surprise of roses fruit and nuts was delivered. The breakfast is excellent and we ate in all the restaurants service top notch. Food and wines reasonable quality and value. The pool is fabulous long and gently heated pool area service great with complimentary iced water sun lotion hats and occasional fruity sips. Price to stay is between the budget 5* like Sofitel and high end 5* like Mandarin which suited us    My one complaint not well handled was the temperature of the cardio fitness room which on every occasion I went in was far too warm despite 5 requests to the fitness staff to sort out the A/C. Nothing changed: Comfort and safety were not taken seriously in this area. I spoke to reception twice (and asked for my concern to be escalated the the manager) but no response except to be told that some guests like to work out in a warm room!    We recommend this hotel overall for its good points described above and its location not too far from the Medina. We plan to return in November and I hope they can sort out their gym A/C by then.,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Oxford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sfb2019

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Charlecote22 wrote a review Feb 2023,50,Luxurious resort - definitely recommend,Definitely recommend this hotel- just 15 minutes drive to the busy Jamaa el Fna square. Taxis vary in price but on average 100-200 dirhams (£8-16). It is a luxurious hotel couldn’t fault it! The food staff room facilities were excellent. Breakfast is expensive but definitely recommend Symphonie Patisserie in the shopping centre (M Avenue) next door grab a lift in the buggy down to the hotel entrance and then a few minutes walk.,Date of stay: February 2023,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Warwickshire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Charlecote22
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Papad wrote a review Feb 2023,50,Perfection,The hotel is a 25-30 minute walk from the hustling and bustling Medina area. You experience the four seasons attention to service as soon as you step in. Our room was beautiful and had a gorgeous little terrace overlooking the gorgeous gardens and pool. The breakfast is brilliant and my favorite were the Moroccan pancakes and shashuka they made.. shukran Younis. The complimentary car service that dropped us to our dinner at the Medina was a nice touch. The Hammam at the four seasons with Fatima Zahra was discreet and amazing. I highly recommend dinner at La Sultana. We also ate at La Moroccon at La Mammounia but were not super impressed. We almost booked La Mammounia for our stay but last minute switched to four seasons and we’re glad we did. Oh and there is an extremely modern shopping avenue called M avenue that is right next to the hotel. I recommend venturing out of the hotel and walking and exploring the area in and around the Medina by foot.,Date of stay: February 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Chicago, Illinois",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Papad

The staff sprang into action delivering us full sized toiletries Moroccan robes and diapers for our youngest. We stayed for 5 days and the staff got to know our preferences and everyone was warm and friendly the chefs even customized some meals for my pickier eater.    We stayed in their standard rooms which were well appointed and spacious. We tried all 3 restaurants and all of them were quite good although we thought that Quattro is the standout.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Ian C wrote a review Dec 2022,50,A classic Four Seasons experience,We had an issue with our room on the first night and the Four Seasons team went way beyond what was expected to rectify the problem.    Overall we had a very positive stay.    Pros:  -Pools: good split for adults and kids. Good pool side service.  -Child friendly: we had a nanny for our one year old who was fantastic. Kids club is one of the best we have seen.  -Staff: all incredibly friendly and they all made a massive effort with our child.  -Gardens: beautiful established gardens. Relaxing to sit on the terrace listening to the birds. We enjoyed several lunches and dinners on the terrace on the third floor in total privacy.    Minor things to consider:  -Don’t expect a cultural experience at the hotel. The lobby and reception feel very monotonous and needs updating.  -Lighting (bright) and music (cheesy pop) at the Italian restaurant for dinner was a not fit for the environment.  -Weird set up with the duvet where the inner kept coming out of the cover. There are no buttons on the cover itself. You end up waking inside the duvet inner.    We were super impressed with the hotel friendliness and the overall quality of the stay.    Their ability to fix our room problem effortlessly was a great touch.,Date of stay: December 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iancI6055GJ
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,steven b wrote a review Dec 2022,50,Wonderful resort with great service.,I stayed here for a winter sunshine break as a solo traveller. The room which was a premier garden terrace room was perfect for my stay. Good size well equipped with lovely garden views and west facing for the afternoon sunshine. It was also really quiet and peaceful which is what I'd requested.  The hotel is near the airport so being met by a hotel car and driven to the hotel took only a few minutes.  The pool areas like the hotel are really stylish and relaxed. The adult pool was perfect for me and I was pleased to see that if families with children arrived  they were politely redirected to the family pool area. The pool service was friendly and prompt and the provision of bottled water in a cool box was very welcome.  The hotel restaurants were efficient and friendly with good service although I did find breakfast a bit erratic on two days when the hotel was full with a large tour party.  The concierge also organised the trips I wanted with an excellent english speaking guide which added to my enjoyment of this city.  I will certainly return to this hotel without a doubt and would highly recommend it to anyone who wanted great service in a peaceful location.,Date of stay: November 2022,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevebE6409JH

Although we loved getting out to explore the Medina and desert the best part of the trip was this amazing resort with its very caring and attentive staff. They helped ensure our short stay wasn’t too impacted by our luggage not making it. Our suite was perfect and our kids enjoyed the plunge pool on the patio. The Italian restaurant and room service were delicious (please add more vegetarian food to your menu - tofu or veggie burgers).

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Dan R wrote a review Nov 2022,50,"Great stay, wonderful hotel, superior staff team",My wife and I spent five nights at the Four Season Resort Marrakech recently and had a wonderful stay. Like most Four Seasons somehow you find yourself feeling like you're the only guests at the hotel. This property was no exception. The setting is beautiful with manicured landscaping fountains and pools. You have absolutely no awareness of the bustle beyond the hotel property. The hotel staff was very attentive to any needs always greeted us and really seemed to go the extra mile of service. The food was very good and we had breakfast lunch and dinner at different times during our stay. The Italian restaurant Quattro was quite good. The hotel arranged transportation and tours for us and were extremely helpful even when we had last minute changes. The room was very nice and has a terrace with lounge chairs and table/chairs discreetly nestled by the adult pool. We'll definitely find our way back to this property. We've stayed at Dorchester collection hotels as recently as a few months ago and i would place this property as comparable or above the staff service levels there.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Marc B wrote a review Nov 2022,50,A Good Choice for Luxury and Relaxation,After 5 days in Marrakech's Medina and a couple of days spent in the Atlas mountains we chose to return to the posh Four Seasons Resort for some coddling before heading home a few days later. Gorgeous grounds a blissful “adults-only” pool (which they enforced - they sent folks with children to the also very-nice family pool) with poolside service (including a cooler filled with chilled bottled water as soon as you sat down) a lovely spa and a couple of restaurants and bars it was the right choice to decompress from the sights and sounds of Marrakech before heading home.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,AFoodieDMV wrote a review Nov 2022,50,An oasis of tranquility,From the moment we arrived the sense of tranquility and beauty washed over us. We considered staying at a local boutique hotel but did not regret our decision.    The staff was overwhelmingly perfect from the valet drivers to the front desk/concierge pool attendees housekeeping and some of the restaurant(s) staff. Our needs were always met and service was over and beyond. Jahine was always available - even if it wasn’t her responsibility to bear.    Must go to the spa! This is the first time I tried a hammam treatment & was extremely happy with the end result. The bedroom & bathroom was spacious loved our balcony and the view.    Tiny deficiencies that we noticed: no Four Seasons store which we typically expect. I forgot gym clothes and was looking to purchase at their store. The safe in our room kept giving us errors. Make sure you can lock & open before putting items in.    The food in the lobby (upstairs restaurant) is just mediocre & the Italian restaurant was ok. Nothing we’d go back for - just convenient.  The breakfast buffet is great but by the 3rd day I had hoped for a tiny change in offerings. There are several options to choose from but if you’re staying for more than 3-4 days you definitely can tire of it.    Otherwise the Four Seasons helped made it easy to fall in love with Marrakech.,Date of stay: November 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AFoodieDMV

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,totalhoteladdict wrote a review Nov 2022,30,Very disappointing,This hotel illustrates that some luxury chains are all about expansion even if they sacrifice on quality.  The hotel is mediocre. Hard to tell that the hotel is just 12 years old. The decoration is bland it is not well maintained and you could be anywhere. Hard to tell if you are in Doha Atlanta or Capetown.  Food was mediocre at best.  Only positive note was the friendly staff and the spa therapists.  To be honest if you choose this hotel for your first stay at a Four Seasons you will never want to stay in Four Seasons again.  Also zero environmental policy. Breakfast arrived always with everything wrapped in transparent film and they still have small plastic amenity bottles.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Emsie1967 wrote a review Oct 2022,50,"Wow, what an amazing place!",This trip was a long time coming as it had been postponed for the last two years so by the time we eventually came it coincided with my sister’s 50th birthday celebrations. All off to a good start when he emailed the hotel a few times before arrival with various questions and all promptly and efficiently answered. I also mentioned it was for a special birthday which was rewarded with a room upgrade and Prosecco and a chocolate cake for the birthday girl delivered by a lovely lad who quite happily joined in singing happy birthday with us three ladies in our room.    Special note to the three gentlemen all called Badr on reception who tended to our every request and even beyond. Just to mention when you get your room key there is a QR code on it which if you scan you can then WhatsApp front desk if you want any restaurants booked etc. This worked really well. We changed all our money from GBP to MAD at reception too.    We took advice from the hotel and as none of us had been to Morocco before we booked a half day guide through them to take us into the city. The chap we had was Jamil who was lovely super informed and guided us through the Bahia palace the sights and sounds of the Medina and the souks and gave us tips along the way. If possible ask for Jamil - you can’t go wrong!    The next evening we went to watch the sun set over the main square in one of the restaurants there that overlooked the hustle of bustle of the street food sellers as they set up shop. Then we went into the medina felt very safe and just followed the advice from Jamil. The souks shut up shop around 9pm.    At the hotel’s recommendation we had dinner one night at La Sultana which was lovely. Would highly recommend. Also lunch in the medina at Le Jardin - delicious. We also went to La Mamounia which is the hotel where Churchill used to stay for pre dinner drinks. And then onto a fab Italian called La Trattoria which again was quite breathtaking.    We were on b&b basis at the hotel and breakfast was plentiful with lots of choice. We sat outside on the terrace every morning.    We made use of the hotel pool every day relaxing on the sun loungers. Very attentive staff who bought us cool boxes with iced bottled water. Special mention to Ismail who we interacted with the most. Very helpful and friendly young man. We had lunch most days in the pool side restaurant usually sharing a pizza between the three of us. We didn’t eat in the hotel in the evenings.    The hotel provide a free shuttle car into the city wherever you want to go from 18.00-22.00. You can’t book it you have to wait if it is already out on a run or book a taxi. About 50 MAD each way but set your price before you get it. It is a final price so you don’t have to tip. You can also book the hotel shuttle to bring you back to the hotel but there is a charge for this.    Our flight home was quite late so we were able to use the facilities at the spa to shower and change for our onward journey which worked really well.    So all in all we had an absolutely fantastic time. Everyone we encountered at the hotel from the gardeners to the resort manager and hotel manager all lovely.    Thankyou all so much for making our stay so wonderful and we all said we would love to come back sometime.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,SteveM987654321 wrote a review Sep 2022,50,Excellent experience,We stayed on a combination business trip and family holiday. The property and rooms are excellent and on par with what you would find in Miami or Florida. After enjoying the madness of downtown Marrakech it is literally an oasis of calm and luxury. All the staff we interacted with were very friendly helpful and professional; well trained but with a genuine Moroccan welcome. You can see attention to detail everywhere; from the flowers in reception to the baby welcome pack changing mat and baby bath in our room. Child cutlery was provided at breakfast without prompting and you felt the hotel put effort in to be family friendly. The kids club is excellent (Samira is great!) and although it says from 4 you can take in younger kids if parents supervise. There is an adults only pool family pool AND a toddler pool with sunshade (this pool could do with a little maintenance on tiles etc). I can see the attraction of staying in a Riad or cheaper hotel but we would really recommend the 4 Seasons particularly for families.,Date of stay: September 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Marbella, Spain",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SteveM987654321

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Erica M wrote a review Jun 2022,50,"Stunning hotel, great location, extensive gardens",Just come back from a week stay with husband and 13 year old daughter. They offered us two style of rooms and let us look around both before deciding which suited us better.  Both rooms were beautiful but the one we chose was bigger and therefore better for us spotless with lovely bedding which you expect from this level of hotel.  The gardens are extensive well maintained and both pools are gorgeous and relaxing.  Staff are super friendly and attentive.  The hotel location was great too. We ate in almost 20 different restaurants around the city over the week and all where only a short 10 minute ride in one of the hotels cars which were always a available to take us and pick us up.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,TrustedTraveller2 wrote a review Jun 2022,40,"Big, beautiful and busy",We stayed here three nights and almost everything was excellent. The grounds and public areas are stunning and the food and service were great. Our room was lovely with a beautiful terrace. The problem was that when we opened the door to either go out on the terrace or just to get fresh air the AC went off - and never came back on. I tried to adjust the temperature but finally had to call for assistance. The maintenance guy came immediately (amazing in a huge hotel) and said he needed to turn it on from his end. That worked fine until the next time we opened the terrace door and it happened again. So the sleep quality wasn't great because our room was hot on a couple nights until they finally got it fixed. Other than that the bed was comfortable the bathroom was large and had two sinks and housekeeping was prompt every morning. The drinks in the bar are strong and they come with various nuts/olives etc. We ate dinner in the hotel one night and the Italian food is fabulous. The breakfast buffet is ample with omelet and crepe stations and we thought it was a better option than ordering off the menu. The beautiful setting on the terrace with palm trees and a reflecting pool is beyond compare.,Date of stay: April 2022,,Dallas,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TrustedTraveller2
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,AHARON G wrote a review Jun 2022,50,Paradise,I understand why people travel just to stay put in this resort. We recently went for our 45th anniversary. The Hotel upgraded my wife and me to a suite overlooking the garden and adult pool. Everything was fabulous. First of all the room itself was perfect. Large spotless and modern furniture consistent with Four Seasons quality. Then the grounds including the lobby the pool and the gardens were glorious. Truly paradise. I stayed at the Mamounia on this trip too. To compare- I would take Four Seasons' room 10 out of 10 times. What makes Mamounia unique are the pools and the grandeur of its lobby. You can't make a mistake in deciding to pick one of these. Four seasons has impeccable service and 5 star treatment with a very strong Moroccan charm. Thank you Four Seasons for a trip we will remeber for the rest of our life-and we only stayed ONE night! Next time  we will correct this.,Date of stay: May 2022,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aharong249
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,fred-aa-stair wrote a review Jun 2022,50,Amazing stay!,The Four Seasons Hotel has one of the largest (and nicest) grounds compared to other 5 Star hotels in Marrakech. Our trip did not start well as they had forgotten to pick us up from Airport however we quickly forgot the issue once we arrived at the hotel and the team made up for that blunder in other ways. You can tell the quality of a hotel by the way they sort out problems and believe me that's exactly what they did! Hotel accommodation is amazing. We had a 1st floor suite away from the main pool and the accommodation was so tranquil. Breakfast has a good amount of choice quality is good (fresh eggs pancakes etc). Lunch by the pool is recommended as they have a good amount of choice. In the evenings they had 3 places you can eat from or you can walk around the corner and experience some other local places.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,PriDee wrote a review May 2022,20,Very poor - not up to the Four Seasons standards,Stayed here end of April / beginning May. Starting with positives - pool facilities and dining options were great.    The issue however is the condition of the rooms. They are very outdated and not clean. This can be looked over somewhat - though the biggest issue was the condition of the mattress. Very squeaky completely worn out. The noise makes it almost impossible to get a decent night sleep. They have a sign in the room outlining that the room rate is EUR 617 - for that much you'd expect a mattress that doesn't squeak and hasn't sagged!    Be careful if you have stayed at other Four Seasons. This is a big notch below other experiences we have had at the other FS resorts/hotels.

We had a lovely terrace but when we opened the door the AC went off and we couldn't get it to come back on. A maintenance man came to the room immediately and said he needed to turn it on from his end so it was fixed until the next day when it happened again. By the third day it was fixed for good and everything was fine. In general service was very good and our issue was quickly addressed. The food for dinner and breakfast was excellent. We appreciated the plug converter and the bowl of fruit. The bathroom was spacious with two sinks and a plug for my curling iron (unlike some hotels which only have plugs for shavers in the bathroom).

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Traveller wrote a review Apr 2022,50,Fantastic,We just came back from a fantastic stay at this hotel. The staff was kind enough to upgrade us when our original room had an issue with the bed and the new room was one with a terrace facing the pool. Wow ! Spacious  well designed and even with sun beds outside. The only small things that didn’t work well were the toilet that kept running water after flushing (you had to press the button twice) one of the terrace doors which wouldn’t open and the round switch outside the bathroom which kept falling off (room 38 incase management wants to take a look. These are tiny details that were noticed but didn’t take away from our amazing stay!).  I also enjoyed the spa as I was always the only person there at around 4pm (it has a sauna and hammam and two different pools and also a relaxation area and an outdoor space - all separated men/ women). I played tennis two days in a row and the coach was great. The service was impeccable and I would especially like to thank a member of staff at the concierge / reception desk who helped us plan dinner outings and a short trip to the mountains (his name is short and starts with Ba…). The hotel has a lovely energy is well designed and feels quiet even if there are families and children around. I would include more options for the breakfast buffet but other than that the food was very good. The most important thing is that I never felt ripped off for anything  which is a feeling you often get at big luxury resorts. This is a huge plus.

It has great facilities a good restaurant great bar well equipped gym and 2 pools- One is adults only which during the Easter holidays is a real blessing.  The rooms are well appointed and grounds are well kempt.  But there are 2 things that make this hotel exceptional and which makes this our go to hotel when visiting Marrakech.  The first is the staff the service throughout our stay was superb nothing seemed to be too much trouble and we were always greeted with a smile.  The second is that even over the easter period when it was busy it was an oasis of calm the pool area was quiet  the bar relaxed and it never felt busy..a welcome relief after a day in the Medina.

The hotel is located on a large 40-acre property and appears to be fairly new. The room we had was large and well appointed. There was a walk-in closet and a large bathroom. The bed was large and comfortable and the linens were nice.    The bath was large and had a separate shower plus a tub. The room had a small frig a coffee maker and a pot to make hot water. The coffee maker used coffee “cassettes” and they didn’t replace the used ones during our stay. In the main lobby they would put out a coffee maker and those cassettes so I’d pick up a few cassettes each day to replace the ones we used.    It was easy to connect to the Internet and the speed was adequate.    We at in the Quatro restaurant several times and the food and service was good.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Rocio wrote a review Mar 2022,50,FAMILY PARADISE! BEST SERVICE!,Had the most magical family vacation at the Four Seasons Marrakech. We couldn’t have asked for a better stay.    The location: is absolutely perfect! Away from the hustle and bustle of the Medina but still near all the landmarks restaurants gardens and shops. This resort is like an oasis in the middle of a desert. Once you step inside there are tons of palm trees…it’s very green and beautiful. Plus you can walk to M Avenue that has many shops and restaurants open. This resort is a PRIME LOCATION!    The amenities: include adult AND family pools kids club teens club clay tennis court fitness center with cardio AND weight room plus a beautiful spa. We used all of the amenities while here. Perfect for families because it has a bit of everything no matter what age.    The food: is super good! You can have lunch at Azzera which has the coolest outside ambiance with live music on the weekends. You can also eat at Quattro it’s an Italian indoor/outdoor restaurant. Here you can enjoy the best breakfast buffet or dinner on the terrace. Then you have Inara a cool Moroccan Turkish Lebanese lounge area where you can order cocktails and food. Great at sunset time because of the most gorgeous view. They even have heaters and blankets outside if it gets too cold.    The rooms: do not disappoint. We stayed in room 30 and connected to room 31. It’s a private patio suite with its own pool. Incredible! The layout is spacious and the room itself is gorgeous! Great location for a family because it’s next to kid’s club and family pool.    My fav part: THE SERVICE! They deserve 10/10! Top Notch Service! The absolute BEST! All staff members have been SO nice cheerful considerate helpful and make you feel like royalty. From checking in with Badr Allal and Sami to Ahmed who is in charge of housekeeping and decorated our room for our anniversary to Mohamed from room service who made sure we always had the correct food order Sara Abde Yassine and Madhi from Azzera always chatting with us every morning with a huge smile behind that mask to Abdu who brings in fresh fruit everyday day Abdel’s turn down service is the best and always on point to Samir in the Inaca lobby restaurant Karima and Samira from kid’s club who took such great care of my kids and even made pizza with them Mohamed and Marouane from Quattro were so accommodating and super sweet Siad is the best pool waiter….always happy Safa who made crepes for us every morning at breakfast Mounir who always is so joyful gave us the best room service. Abdelaziz also from room service was so nice! Abderrahmane was very kind and provided amazing service. Abderrazak was our absolute fav always greeting us with such great energy and making sure we were always cared for. Fatiha from the spa gave me the best massage make sure to request her. Ghizlane from house keeping who kept our room clean all week with such a great attitude!    We love you all so much! None of this would be possible without Asmaa and Reda.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Nikko4Me wrote a review Jan 2022,50,Understand why this property is globally ranked so high!!!!! WOW!!!,We had the pleasure of staying at this resort for three nights on our recent tour of Morocco (Room #208). The service is exceptional and the hotel and grounds are the loveliest we've seen throughout the world. Staff is well trained and go above and beyond with everything they do.    The grounds are tantalize the senses as they are beautiful to see and so fragrant.    The only issue was about the maintenance to the pool and the decision to move the children to the couples pool. We were looking forward to spending some downtime at the pool along with other guests from our tour and others we met in the hotel. Each day we attempted to use the pool we were frustrated with one family of 6 children 2 parents and a nanny who decided the pool was theirs alone. The children screamed splashed and harassed other guests until they left. The lifeguards attempted to talk to the parents twice but the parents got upset and ranted that their children were only being children. Management never intervened to resolve the issues. What disappointed us was the decision to put the children with the couples in the first place. It appeared only half of the family pool was under work so not sure why the children use that half. I did note this in my feedback directly to the hotel management and they apologized for the inconvenience and noted the both pools are now open. That's great for those there now but in the future recommend against mixing couples and children as some of are on vacation to relax and not battle ill behaved children.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,MarcelSZ wrote a review Nov 2021,50,A great place to be,Overall staying in 4 seasons was an amazing experience and we would always come back. On the positive side:  + The service standard friendliness hospitality is very high the employees really care about their guests and try to surprise them positively starting with the concierge and the very friendly bell boys - always with a smile - the waiters cleaning staff they are really fantastic  + The spa area w separate areas for men and women  + The long 40 meter heated pool and the separation of pools for families and adults  + the gym  + the food in Quattro was very very delicious (the tiramisu is a wow)  + the drinks in the bar 👌  + they provide filtered water in glass bottles    On the improvement side:  - the breakfast buffet is good but a bit expensive considering that the selection does not alternate much (maybe due to Covid?)  - overall price of the rooms is high  - Environmental program to be improved: there is a massive amount of towels that is constantly exchanged although they describe it differently would call it kind of green washing.    all in all very recommendable!!,Date of stay: November 2021,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Switzerland,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarcelSwitzerland

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Manuel QP wrote a review Nov 2021,20,Not a Four Seasons standards,I was told that children do not pay to eat.  Bill always came with what my child eat.  my Child is 2years and so would not go to have dinner to restaurant. All he eat in the room was charged. It does not make sense to say children do not pay and then charge him to have dinner because he does not have age to have dinner in a. Restaurant. Just does not make sense.  in check out I had to go and look at all bills and there it was thinks that my child eat during the day.    reception took it out of the bill.    ate night when I was home I got info from my credit card the the Hotel Four Seasons tried to charge my card with out any warning. This is not admissible!  For 20 ou 30 euros your hotel tried to charge my card.

The setting is amazing.  The restaurants serve top notch food  Its location in Hivernage is a 5 minute 30-50 Dirham ride away from the Medina  Signature Four Seasons bedding......meaning you won't want to get out of bed....but don't worry breakfast runs quite late  Price of food at the restaurants was reasonable    The spa is also fantastic with a beautiful Hammam    The best part was the staff though. They had no problem preparing me a custom dish not on the menu at the pool restaurant.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Fiona Uk wrote a review Oct 2021,50,An absolute pleasure and delight,My husband and I went to the Four Seasons in Marrakech during October 2021. All I can say it was an absolute pleasure and delight being there guests once again.  No one could do enough to make our stay a delight. In fact we had planned to go to another hotel in the Medina but we ended up returning here for another 2 nights.  It was that pleasurable. As I mentioned to my husband your sensibility has sort of shifted in these COVID times so you basically want to relax in peace and have some quiet time to chill out.  Everyone from Abdellatif hnini the food manager at the restaurant who made our meals a delight and had such a calming and professional manner to cater to our needs… to all the girls at the Spa helping us ease our worries away.. everyone couldn’t do enough for us. The service is impeccable. They even gave us a lovely upgrade upon arrival.  I will be returning here every year as it’s just want we need at this time.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Four seasons Fan wrote a review Oct 2021,40,The dirtiest Four seasons in the world,I came to this hotel for 5 nights to relax after a long trip. To my surprise the hotel is super old with sagging furniture and dirty amenities. Their bathrooms in the pool were dirty and full of human fetus. In addition nobody could wash their hands because the skin wasn’t working. Nobody was attending to the area and it was a hub to catch covid 19 virus. The resort manager Pierre is just a punk and a loser. He is racist and all the staff now to him like he is royalty. The hotel room itself doesn’t warrant the price tag of 700 dollars a night. Bad menus wrong pricesclocks that don’t have the precise GMT time. All their hotel clocks are two or three minutes ahead. Their menu in the room is ugly and it feels like a holiday inn carte. Cold food bad toilet paper ugly granite shower leaking plumbing issues hotel parties although there is a curfew I will come back for more reviews because I am not done. Avoid At all expense. I am attaching one example picture of the sink that wasn’t working in the main pool so all guests were swimming with dirty hands.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,SeverusAlexander wrote a review Oct 2021,50,Understand why this resort is on many of the top hotel lists,My wife and I had the pleasure of staying at this resort for three nights on our recent tour of Morocco. We had high expectations of this hotel reading the reviews and they lived up to it. The service is exceptional and the hotel and grounds are the nicest we've seen throughout the world. As a Four Season (we've been to a few others) this is best of the best. Staff is well trained and go above and beyond with everything they do. Our first night we arrived my wife and were a little lost (yes it's that big of a hotel) and a restaurant manager noticed us. He immediately left the restaurant and walked us all the way to our door. He didn't give us directions send someone to bring us etc. Nope he dropped everything to ensure we immediately got back to our room. That's the type of service you don't see many places. The grounds are beautiful and so fragrant with the ground staff using rakes and their hands instead of mechanical devices to avoid noises to the guests. Loved the automated temperature scanning of guests as you enter the property.    Our only complaint was about the maintenance to the pool and the decision to move the children to the couples pool. We were looking forward to spending some downtime at the pool along with other guests from our tour and others we met in the hotel. Each day we attempted to use the pool we were frustrated with one family of 6 children 2 parents and a nanny who decided the pool was theirs alone. The children screamed splashed and harassed other guests until they left. The lifeguards attempted to talk to the parents twice but the parents got upset and ranted that their children were only being children. Management never intervened to resolve the issues. What disappointed us was the decision to put the children with the couples in the first place. It appeared only half of the family pool was under work so not sure why the children use that half. I did note this in my feedback directly to the hotel management and they apologized for the inconvenience and noted the both pools are now open. That's great for those there now but in the future recommend against mixing couples and children as some of are on vacation to relax and not battle ill behaved children. Also advise management to update guests when work is done on pools and other areas prior to arrival so guests can reschedule if needed.    Overall great experience and we will definitely return and stay at the Four Seasons Resort Marrakech on our next trip to Marrakeck and recommend you stay there also.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Rastraveller wrote a review Sep 2021,10,Tired and outdated Hotel: worst of the 5* hotels in Marrakech,We stayed in August for 3 nights.    The entire stay from start to finish is the worst I have experienced in many years. I will go as far as to say the front office manager is the rudest individual I have come across in 25 years of international travel.    The check in process was very poor nothing was explained regarding the changes due to covid such as the process of gym bookings or where the hotels facilities were located (the next morning I was asked to leave the gym as I hadn't booked). The rooms were small and outdated compared to the Fairmont and Oberoi (both were hotels we had stayed at during our 10 day stay). Even after fighting for an upgrade the room was not on par with what other hotels were offering.    Rooms remained uncleaned even at 3pm - we were told they normally have until 4pm. This was completely unacceptable for us and I'm sure any family with children would agree. The kids area and young adult centre had broken cues broken playsation controllers missing pool balls. It was embarrassing to see the four seasons in such a state.    In summary I would avoid. There are many 5* options that are infinitely better.,Date of stay: August 2021,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Raznich1

Hotel is outstanding will certainly be returning as a guest during my next opportunity to travel. Having stayed at several FS properties around the world we expected it to be great but had thought the service might be a little lacking as we weren’t residents. How wrong we were?!… From the moment we entered we were made to feel like royalty until the moment we left. 10am-midnight (it was that good we stayed for dinner and then some…) The hotel itself the grounds etc are absolutely stunning. The food and service is top notch. A special shout-out to Tariq who is a true gentleman and a kind-hearted man. It was a pleasure to meet him.

Well as the saying goes you save the best till last!!!    I have been blown away by the peaceful tranquility of an amazing hotel in central Marrakech. The service is sublime and the overall beauty and quality of the property is without doubt the best I have experienced in Morocco.    My bedroom is perfect room service and housekeeping exceptional and when I have had two issues to be resolved both have been handled speedily and without fuss.    Sitting by the pool yesterday evening and having drinks and snacks was such a relaxing experience and of course the weather helps but everything about this place says quality service and customer care at the highest order.    They have a children’s pool with all the toys and the main pool is luxury. I had a superb lunch at the poolside restaurant yesterday. Simple Classical food done brilliantly well and the breakfast this morning with excellent covid protections In place was as good as it gets. There are staff everywhere always on hand to help and not hiding from the guests as happens in so many hotels.    This is without doubt the best resort I’ve experienced outside the Far East resorts.

Everything about the Four Seasons in Marrakech is amazing the lobby smells incredible the rooms are beautiful crisp sheets beautiful personalised touches  wonderful views from the balconies. We have travelled with our children each time and the staff are so attentive to them little gifts in the room nothing is too much trouble. The hotel offers free food for under 5's which has been amazing for our little one and the kids club wow the staff are incredible. Our son had the best time at the kids club with his little friend (who was French) absolutely exceptional service snacks included and they will even take them to lunch all together (at no cost) we were blown away it could easily rival a high end English nursery. The pool staff are wonderful bringing complimentary iced water and a pool side meal service (which was really amazing food). The pool is heated and there is a jacuzzi hot tub too. Nothing is too much trouble I forgot some medication and asked at reception and they sent their driver to the pharmacy to get the medication and only charged us the few pounds of the cost of the item. Just incredible.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Javed K wrote a review Mar 2020,50,Awesome children friendly hotel,We stayed four days during the Coronavirus Pandemic when President Trump banned all travel to the USA. Let me just tell you that I spent over two hours with the front desk trying to get connected with the airline US Embassy and they helped me book another flight home. I cannot say enough good things about the staff at the Four Seasons Marrakech.    We flew in early morning and arrive at the hotel around 9am significantly earlier than check-in time. The front desk was so welcoming and offered us breakfast while they got a room ready for us so we can check in early. I used my American Express Fine Hotel & Resorts card so we received additional benefits such as complimentary breakfast $100 spa credit room upgrade late checkout etc.    I cannot give enough praise to the hotel staff. Within a few hours the staff new our names went above the call of duty to make our stay memorable. The room was nice and cozy as were upgraded to a view overlooking the pool. Snacks were in the room they gave us plenty of complimentary water bottles and even when we hit the pool they gave us plenty of water bottles.    For those with kids this is probably the best hotel in Marrakech. They have a children's club which my 7 and 3 year old loved. It also gave us the ability to leave the kids behind so we could have some alone time at dinner. Lots of games and very friendly staff in the kids club.    The breakfast was nice although the same foods every day. I wish they offered more traditional Moroccan foods like tagine and harira soup as I've seen at other hotels in Morocco. The smoothies or as they call detox drinks where tremendous as were the nutella crapes.    Dinner was nice we tried all the restaurants. The kids love pizza so even for lunch we tried the restaurant in the lobby and they went to another restaurant by the pool to get us pizza.    I always collect Four Seasons hats and although they did not sell this in the boutique the shop gave me a green hat which I did not like and the front desk gave me a yellow one which I loved and refuse to take my money. This is the extra service you expect from Four Seasons.    In the early hours of March 12th Trump banned all travel back to the USA so we were stressed about being stranded. The hotel was so nice and made accommodations for us and spent two hours with us to do so.    Another plus the hotel offers a guide for 550 MAD to visit the medina. They have their own taxis that they use so you don't have to worry about getting ripped off. They give you the option to use their luxury cars albeit expensive or they can call a taxi for you which is much cheaper. I liked the options.    My wife had a hamman and loved the experience. I visited the spa and pools and liked it. My only complaint is that both hot tubs (jacuzzi) outside and in the spa are not hot at all. My only other complaint was that we frequently saw ants in our room and each day of our stay. I wouldn't expect this at a Four Seasons.    There is also a teen club with a basketball hoop pool table and air hockey. What am amazing place for families.    Thank you everyone at the Four Seasons Marrakech for an unbelievable stay. After leaving this hotel we stayed at the Four Seasons Casablanca and that hotel did not come remotely close to living up to the Marrakech experience. I would recommend anyone to stay here as you will be grateful as it's much more low key and chill versus staying in the medina walls which is crowed polluted and hard to navigate through.,Date of stay: March 2020,,"Naples, Florida",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/295javedk

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Levenez75 wrote a review Mar 2020,50,Fantastic hotel - amazing staff and services,We spent a week at the Four Seasons in Marrakech in October 2019 for half term. We went as a family with two kids aged 3 and 8. We had two connecting rooms one with a living room.  Overall the experience was what you can expect from Four Seasons. Excellent service at all levels from check-in to all the restaurants room service kids club spa sport...  You can see how well run the hotel is when everything is delivered smoothlessly by the staff. They all know what who you are what allergies you have what you prefer... needs you didn't know you had are being met discretely. The staff clearly goes beyond their duties in order to help you whatever you need and ensure whatever you needed was delivered.  Most things were arranged prior to arrival thanks to the hotel: private guided tours baby sitter for the 3-yr old spa program golf rounds... We only added swimming lessons for our older boy.  one magical experience that remains anchored in our boys memory is the sunset and evening in the Agafay desert at Inara Camp. This was of course organised by the hotel. We had a camel ride before being able to enjoy the sunset and a delicious dinner under the stars.  Thank you so much to all the staff at the hotel that contributed to our fantastic stay at Four Seasons. We are looking forward to coming back.,Date of stay: October 2019,,Sweden,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Levenez75
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,tcmb99 wrote a review Mar 2020,40,Quiet and Spacious,We liked our stay in Four Seasons Marrakech a lot. It is a small city so although it is not walking distance to the Medina it is a very short taxi ride away.    The hotel itself was generally very quiet except the busy breakfast with two very large pools separated for families and adults. There are plenty of places to rest and relax around the property.    We visited the spa and I think they could do better the Hammam and spa space was very small compared to hotels of this size around the world.    Our room was spacious and comfortable with a large balcony to enjoy the Moroccon sun. The only issue I have with the room was that it gets too much noise from the corridors and the plumbing system of the building. For light sleepers this can be an issue.    Overall I think this is a very good hotel with standart Four Seasons luxuries.,Date of stay: January 2020,,"Istanbul, Türkiye",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tcmb99

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,ZY.. wrote a review Mar 2020,10,Poor services !!!,Poor service We arrived around noon I was told if will be ready for check in at 2:30pm after I asked a few times as they send us to wait in the restaurant for long time without telling us when... then I asked them if I should come back to reception for check in or someone will come to us replied just wait by the pool. By 3:30 no one came to us and I went to reception again myself finally got in. When I said I was told ready to check in at 2:30pm they replied their check in time is 3pm. I said it doesn’t matter to me 2:30pm or 3pm my point is when you told me 2:30pm someone will come to us then someone should have come to us at least 3pm. But no one came to us one hour later. I was stuck there waiting. I could have gone for swimming or do other things. The person says he will report it to the manager and come back to us never happened. At check out I mentioned it he didn’t bother again to remind me their check in time is 3pm totally ignored my point.    After check out I realise I left my facial cream in the bathroom as I have friends who are going to Marrakesh the following week I asked if they have found reply is no. I am 100% sure that I left in the bathroom as I used shortly before check out in the bathroom. Luckily only a facial cream !!!    Facility is ok much busier than Amaneja service is much better there.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Daniel C wrote a review Feb 2020,50,Four night stay in balcony guest room overlooking the central fountains.,The Four Seasons is much more than just a resort anyone can stay in a Riad but you come to this hotel for the service. Sonia Bendich our concierge arranged excursions with the safest most reliable tour companies guides and drivers throughout the city. From hot air balloon rides with reputable companies to one of the most fantastic guides of Marrakech Adil. I recommend asking for Adil by name as a guide throughout the city. He knows everyone in Marrakech was able to get reservations at any restaurant at a moments notice very educated in the history of Marrakech and was able to tailor our experience to our interests. From the best food cultural sites excursions and places to buy specific items. He even haggled on our behalf in shops and in the souks! I had arranged a surprise engagement as well as a surprise family visit with partial planning in advance and the rest as the trip progressed Sonia was able to make it all happen. At a moments notice we had a driver throughout the mountains to camels and a private dinner in the Agafay desert. I have traveled all over the world from Qatar to Bali to French Polynesia and Europe and this experience was one of the best I have ever had. All due to the service provided.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Joanne T wrote a review Feb 2020,50,Marrakech Magic,My family and I have just returned from a break at this wonderful resort and we could not be happier. We returned feeling relaxed refreshed and rested. It is the most enjoyable and interesting holiday we have ever had overseas.    The property is stunning and the staff attentive and genuinely friendly and engaging. My children aged 6 and 10 had the time of their lives enjoying a luxurious suite with private terrace family pool and absolutely amazing kids club. The team at the kids club are fantastic with the children and so enthusiastic particularly at an evening Pirate Party or 'soiree'. Yasmin Imane and the rest of the team took no time at all to get to know our children very well and were very flexible in when and for how long the children could attend the club. The range of activities were varied and interesting; Bread making model making talent shows yoga football the list is endless.    The adult pool was serene and calm plenty of sunbeds available. The family pool well appointed with water toys and activities. There was even a very shallow covered pool available as part of the kids club.Particular mention to Muhammed the life guard who was great with the kids at the pool and came to the aid of our youngest when he needed help.    I found the 40 acre gardens to be immaculately kept and enjoyed strolling around the peaceful array of fountains features and plant displays.    The breakfast buffet in the Quattro restaurant had a wide array of items including fresh fruit cereals baked goods hot food and freshly made to order pancakes crepes and eggs. We found the earlier we attended the quieter it was and we enjoyed the service of many attentive staff who went out of their way to engage with our children helping them into their chairs asking them which soccer team  they supported etc. Our 10 year old even commented about how friendly everyone in Morroco is! Youssane gets our compliments at breakfast thank you for your service.    As well as the luxury of the resort we took a guided trip to The Medina and Souks as organised by the concierge and it was a great way to see the hustle and bustle of the old town - a true flavour of Marrakech.    With only a 10 minute transfer from the airport everything is so seamless and easy.    I will truly miss waking up to a magical call to prayer overlooking the misty High Atlas Mountains at dawn.,Date of stay: February 2020,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joannetV208LT
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Toby W wrote a review Feb 2020,40,Nice half term break,Our family of 4 (children aged 7 and 9) have stayed at the Four Seasons in Marrakech for February half term. All in all it has been a great holiday and the hotel has lived up to expectations in most areas.    We have stayed in a number of Four Seasons resorts around the globe so have a good benchmark against which to evaluate. We had a pool view suite (70m2) in the main Pavillon wing which was very well appointed and clean.  If you opt for a room in the Pavillion we would suggest you ask for the top floor as if you have several people walking on the stone floors in the rooms above you it can become a little irritating. All staff were very friendly and the concierge very efficient at arranging trips out with very knowledgable guides. Our visits to the Medina and also to Berber villages in the mountains were excellent.    We tried all 3 restaurants. Service was a little slow in the Moroccan within the pavilion however the food was great and always served with a smile. The Italian served great fish and the daytime pool restaurant is a nice relaxed outdoor space.    Alcohol can be a little on the expensive side as you would expect (wine from 50 Euros a bottle beer 10 Euros). Should you not have breakfast included in your room rate factor in that it will cost 120 Euros for a family of 4 per day if your children are aged 6 or over. We were aware of that when making our booking.    Breakfast is a buffet with a good variety for all however can be busy if you time it wrong. During our visit in February it was too cold for most families to want to eat outdoors before 10am hence everybody inside. Great omelettes!!    Family pool is a very good space and despite being during a school holiday was not overly busy. 50% of the pool is heated the remainder not however that is probably not an issue in the heat of Summer. We noticed that the cement edges of the pool had broken away during our visit and some small mosaic tiles from the jacuzzi pool had become loose and led to cuts on a couple of children’s feet. The adult pool looked pleasant and a lot quieter!    Our children did not use the kids club although the itinerary looked comprehensive. The young adults club had a pool table table tennis basketball games console and a cinema    Our overall evaluation of the hotel is positive. It is not the best Four Seasons hotel at which we have stayed however the staff were excellent enthusiastic and extremely friendly. We would recommend.,Date of stay: February 2020,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Colchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tobyw334

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,tabithafricker wrote a review Feb 2020,50,An amazing holiday facilitated by outstanding hospitality,My boyfriend and I stayed for 4 days in June-July. I had contacted the hotel prior to arrival about celebrating my boyfriends graduation. They said they would put a little bottle of champagne and balloons in the room for us. However they actually put rose petals all over the bathroom balloons champagne and a mini cake saying congratulations. Then the next night we get back and they provide another bottle of champagne and a cake for him - beyond any expectations we had!    On arrival we were whisked away in the golf buggy and relaxed by the pool whilst we waited for our room to be ready. When we got to the room we realised we had been upgraded to the Pavilion Patio Room. This came with a massive walk in wardrobe bathroom and patio area with a cute nook.    The adult pool was lovely and relaxing and the shrive was brilliant. Free water in water coolers was provided by the pool and the staff were very attentive. Free treats were brought once a day around the pool (such as coconut covered frozen mango sticks).    The restaurants were lovely and smoking shisha in the bar overlooking the resort was a relaxing way to end the evening.    We request and book a tour around the Medina with a personal guide. He picked us up from the hotel and walked us around the Medina giving a little history to it and took us to some of the better shops in the souks. This was great and organised by the hotel!    Breakfast was amazing the buffet spread was outstanding with a vast array of foods.

Chose this hotel for that exact reason. Besides the brand name guaranteed a great stay!  Rooms were substantial and provided tons of amenities. Our sons’ room was closer to the pool and was much bigger than ours. Ours was in the hotel and overlooked the garden! The balcony was beautiful allowing us to enjoy breakfast or coffee privately.  Sometimes getting taxis to get to the medina took longer than expected. Takes less than 10min to get to Jema al F’na Market.

The hotel kindly upgraded us to a lower pavilion one bed suite with a pool. The room was really nice and spotlessly clean.    The gardens and grounds around the hotel are beautiful and peaceful.    We spent a couple of hours each day at the adults only pool. Service was great and the food at the pool side restaurant was very good - for us it was the best food we ate at the hotel.    There is also a very well equipped gym and good spa with separate sections for men and women. Found it a bit odd to find women wandering around in the men’s section though!    We also had a couple of good Moroccan style meals in the Azzara restaurant. Ate once at Quattro and neither of us rated the food. Ordered medium rare rack of lamb that came well done and dry. Similarly we found the breakfast buffet underwhelming.    Service at all the restaurants and around the resort is first rate and all the staff are unfailingly helpful.    It’s a little way out from the center and not really walkable to the center. About 10 minutes in a taxi. You could walk but it’s not a particularly pleasant walk.

Four Seasons was high on my list and I did not regret it. Everything is perfect in particular service. I really enjoyed the outdoor heated pool (majority of 5* have heated pools in winter). Mornings v cold but what a delight to have a swim in the afternoon when it is warm and sunny (in January ... less than 4 hours from London).  The good thing about the hotel is that it is a bit isolated from the city and therefore peaceful and a great place to relax from the busy city. The drawback is that although it is walking distance from the Menara Gardens a taxi is necessary for the other places of interest but not a bad thing given walking is Marrakech is quite tiring.

We tried two of the restaurants and experienced great food and service. The service in the hotel was exactly what you would expect from a Four Seasons. The grounds were spectacular. We did have one horrible experience and I wish to share so that others do not have the same experience. There was an old rug in the room partially under the bed and settee which was an accident waiting to happen except we did not realize until my wife fell and injured her knee. The hotel responded the very best they could. The rug was removed immediately and the hotel apologized profusely. BUT A WARNING TO OTHERS: GET RID OF THIS TYPE OF LOOSE RUG THE MOMENT YOU CHECK INTO YOUR ROOM. P.S. We would still go back to this hotel if the opportunity presented itself.,Date of stay: October 2019,,"Placitas, New Mexico",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rxgale

The rooms will be needing a makeover in about ~5 years time but for now its still perfect. Pool area is very comfortable (we used the kids area because no kids were there).

There is a family pool and a quiet pool which is somewhere between 40 and 50 yards. It was great for doing laps. The attendants also pamper guests. One cleaned my sunglasses brought me a fresh towel after I dried off from swimming my laps brought me a wicker basket with a small ice chest filled with ice and bottled water inside and also brought me a raspberry popsicle.  Our room was huge. It was also very quiet. There are three excellent restaurants. One is a lunch place by the pool and another is an indoor/outdoor one by a large reflecting pool.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Matt wrote a review Nov 2019,50,Amazing service and hotel,My wife and I visited in mid to late October for our wedding anniversary as part of a 2 week vacation in Europe/Africa. What an amazing resort overall and definitely one of the best I have ever stayed at (and I have stayed at multiple 5 star resorts throughout the world)!    Service- absolutely phenomenal. From the front desk staff and concierge to housekeeping and wait staff everyone made us feel welcome and was always available to help with any task. We gave a list of restaurants we wanted to visit over the week to the front staff team and by the end of the day they had booked times and drivers to and from the restaurant. On more than one occasion we decided to change the reservation (timing or restaurant) and they were more than willing to help. Another thing about the private drivers it is 20 euros each way for the driver but we thought it was well worth avoiding dealing with taxis and also the drivers would walk us to the restaurant as well (especially helpful in the maze of the Medina!)    Food- We had breakfast everyday and always had great coffee juices and food to start the day. We ate dinner at Quattro and loved it. We also frequently had lunch at the poolside grill which also had amazing food and great drinks.    Location- Away from the hustle and bustle of the Medina but still close enough to be able to get there quickly for dinner or visits to the Medina.    Tours- The hotel set us up with a guide through the Medina. Our guide Aziz was absolutely amazing and took us to the palace souks and Jemaa el-Fnaa. If you can book a tour with him we would highly recommend it!    Overall an amazing trip and can't imagine a hotel with better service.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,viross5000 wrote a review Nov 2019,50,Brilliant half term break,We stayed for a week in October half term and had a lovely stay. Grounds and pools are brilliant really beautiful and pools are a perfect temperature. Our little boy enjoyed the kids club and the spa treatments were great. The room was nice enough water provided plentifully (although in plastic bottles would be great if there was an alternative). Our boy loved his little dressing gown.    Service on the whole was really good. The barman and a couple of the waiters in Quattro were particularly friendly and helpful. concierge desk and bellboys also notably helpful and friendly.    Food and drink were of a high quality well cooked - breakfast lunch and dinner. Not cheap but not OTT compared to other similar hotels elsewhere. some good recommendations of places to eat outside the hotel too. The kids menu had a decent International selection with some healthier options too would have loved a couple of Moroccan options on there. Some of the lunch specials in the pool restaurant were particularly tasty. Very drinkable Moroccan wines and some tasty cocktails.    A few small things that could be improved for us. A proper outside bar area for a pre dinner drink - there were just a couple of tables attached to the restaurants (appreciate it’s a Muslim country and maybe that’s why). Toiletries for kids in the rooms - no kids shampoo or shower gel. Gym could be better air conditioned (good equipment though). Stopping people reserving sun beds before breakfast (grrrrr - it wasn’t occasional it was about half the beds every day nearly all the front ones and sometimes the beds not then occupied until late morning). keeping the adult pool an adult pool - on two of the three occasions we went there were several kids in it. All very minor niggles!    It’s a well located hotel near the airport and near the city with lovely grounds brilliant pools and good food and wine.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,cindykat wrote a review Oct 2019,50,Serenity in bustling Marrakech,My husband and I stayed at the Four Seasons Marrakech for a week this October. Our stay was wonderful and we can't say enough about the accommodations and the staff.  Upon check in we were upgraded and our room was very large and comfortable. It had 2 outside patio areas which overlooked the beautifully landscaped pool. There were fresh flowers and fruit in the room upon arrival which was a nice touch. The resort always made sure we had plenty of bottled water which was appreciated as most hotels will offer only one or two bottles gratis.  The grounds of there resort were stunning. The landscaping was beautiful and there were so many walkways and quiet seating areas. It was lovely. It was the perfect place for some serenity after maneuvering the busy streets of Marrakech. The lighting at night was spectacular and made you want to just sit and take it all in.  We ate at both restrauants and both were delicious. We didn't think they were overpriced in comparrison to other Four Seasons we've stayed at. We had drinks one night on the patio and its was lovely.  I think the thing that makes this resort stand out for us was the staff. From the moment we checked in until we checked out they went above and beyond. They remembered our names when they would pass us and would always stop to ask if our visit was alright. We asked to arrange for a private guide for one day and it was done with no problem. Our guide Mohammad was fantastic and we would highly recommend asking for him. We also requested a driver for a day to go to Essaouaria. Our driver Faisal was great! He answered all of our questions about life in Marrakech and pointed out great spots along the way. I would highly recommend asking for him also. The staff at the front desk was top notch. They were kind courteous helpful...everything you could ever want from hotel staff. They gave great recommendations for dinners and sightseeing.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Nickwanderlust76 wrote a review Oct 2019,50,Top hotel,We arrived from a previous stay at the Royal Mansour so expected a ‘step down’. However we couldn’t have been more wrong. Following a very warm greeting we were given an upgrade to one of the large and well furnished pavilion terrace rooms. The beds are very comfortable turn down was always well done and coffee always replenished. The breakfast buffet was very good if perhaps a little expensive. The grounds of the hotel are stunning - it feels more like a resort. Both the family and adult pools are stunning. The pool service was excellent - try the pizzas as they are delicious. The hotel kindly provided a Range Rover to whisk us back to the airport. This is a superb hotel. In fact we couldn’t fault it.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,MWC01 wrote a review Oct 2019,50,Fabulous couple of days.,Although we were staying in a smaller boutique Riad in the town in Marrakech we decided to book a pool day with lunch on one of the days during our trip at The Four Seasons and we were't disappointed. From the minute we arrived the service was second to none. The attention to detail is completely on point and we were made to feel incredibly welcome even though we weren't actually staying in the hotel. We booked the package with lunch and the food and the service was absolutely suburb and exceptionally good value. All the staff were fantastic - explaining where the facilities were including complimentary suncream and hats! We enjoyed ourselves so much that we booked a second day two days later. Thank you to the whole team you were all fabulous and we will most certainly return.,Date of stay: October 2019,,"Essex, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MWC01
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Scottyp2014 wrote a review Oct 2019,50,A very nice stay,We spent three nights here celebrating our 40th anniversary. We had a few minor housekeeping snafus that were immediately addressed and the staff spoiled us from there on and made our stay memorable for all of the right reasons. We had an upper pavilion room looking out over the pool with a private sunning patio a nice sized bathroom and excellent amenities. The hotel location is not necessarily within walking distance of anything but a nice public garden but is a short drive from the Medina and most of the key sights. The staff are wonderful--well trained professional and polite. The pool is amazing with comfy loungers and attentive pool staff. The restaurants are limited with one primary breakfast/dinner option and a bar area with food options as well. We ate at both and found the food to be excellent. The breakfast buffet is very good as well. It is a very large resort-style property with beautiful grounds. All in all a great experience.,Date of stay: September 2019,,"Camano Island, Washington",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Scottyp2014
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,DWeb252 wrote a review Oct 2019,50,Fantastic stay - beautiful hotel and attentive service,I booked this trip as a surprise birthday gift to my wife. From start to finish the service was fantastic and the attention to detail provided by the hotel surpassed my expectations despite having stayed in many 5* hotels around the world.    Prior to arrival I emailed to request a cake or similar for my wife to which I received an email back the same day. Upon arrival we found a table complete with flowers rose petals cake and a bottle of Prosecco on ice - all complimentary.    The remainder of our stay was perfect the pool areas were beautifully kept and service by the pool team was fantastic. They asked to clean my sunglasses provided ice cold smoothies and chocolate ice cream pops (these are addictive!!)    On our last day our flight was in the evening so hotel kept our luggage whilst we relaxed then took us and our luggage via buggy to the fitness suite to shower and freshen up before our flight.    Food wise breakfast offered a fair variation and was tasty. We only ate in the hotel restaurant on our last day for convenience however the sea bass Tajine with chermoula and couscous was probably the best thing we ate whilst in marrakech. Fish was flakey and soft and the chermoula marinade and sauce was fantastic - upon telling the waiter how much we enjoyed the dish he asked if we wanted the recipe and returned with a list of ingredients from the chef!    Overall I can not recommend this hotel enough - service was diligent and unobtrusive the app to request services is also handy the hotel is beautifully maintained and rooms are comfortable and well sized (nice bed linen too!)

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Dana in LA wrote a review Sep 2019,50,Majestic Grounds. Great Service. Spacious Rooms.,My best friend and I recently stayed at the Four Seasons Resort in Marrakech as our first visit to Morocco. The grounds of this resort are absolutely breathtaking. We were in awe as we were greeted at the front desk by their polite staff. As we made our way to the lounge area we were welcomed by a young man named Abdelmajid (hope i spelled that correctly) who I could never forget. He was so polite and catering to us. We felt like we were having a royal experience. We had so many questions and he took the time to answer our questions as well as serve us these delicious wine drinks and pastries. Seriously they were a treat! At the end of our stay he even helped us with taking much needed Instagram photos. LOL! It was such a dreamy experience. I will surely return and I highly recommend this resort for anyone going to Marrakech. It is a quick 10 minute taxi ride to the Medina and City Center but also tucked away so perfectly that you feel away from the fast pace movement of the city. If you visit please say hello to Abdelmajid and tell him Yardana said thank you!!

Location Luxury Space Green Food Safety,Stayed at the marvelous Four Seasons Marrakech for my 7th year in a row. We absolutely love this place. The peaceful beautiful green grounds full of beautiful diverse plants and birds everywhere. What a team!! They always coordinate with eachother and inform eachother all your wishes.  How about a lovely room with a small private plunge pool? you got it no problem.  The swimming pool with the amazing restaurant next to it is the place to be. Love the Food and their specials like the famous fresh pizza with truffles.  Spa? yes yes yes. Everyday i visited the Spa for a Treatment. Amazing team. Highly professional. Cannot reccomend them enough.  Dinner at Quattro is incredible. The Tagliata di Manzo and how about a bottle of Chianti Villa Antinori?. love it. They also have a Moroccan Restaurant upstairs which is really really fun and authentic. Both with Live Music.  Lunch outside is also loads of fun for example 5min Taxi to Cafe de La Poste. Amazing French style Brasserie with many locals and foreigners.  Visit the Medina & Shop? 10min by Taxi.  Do not forget to ask the Hotel to book you the VIP Fast Track at the Marrakech airport.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Jessica VM wrote a review Sep 2019,50,Huge rooms,After a long 5 day tour throughout Morocco I was so pleased to know that I was coming to this hotel. Everything is just fantastic. The adult pool is right in front of the bar and literally has anything you could ask for. There are only two restaurants but both are very good. My favorite however was the Italian restaurant which had italian but also moroccan food with a twist. The staff was beyond accommodating and so nice. Nizar our waiter was fantastic!! had the best recommendations for food and even after we couldnt eat any further he rushed our leftovers to our room. They were there before we even got back to our room. The rooms are honestly very large clean modern with a moroccan twist and the A/C is fantastic. My husband a true gym junky went to the gym and was pleased with all the equipment they had along with supplied bottle waters in the fridge fruit tea towels etc. Their breakfast was AMAZING. Had everything you can think of and their detox juices the best. I think every hotel should have these. They have a fair amount of security personnel which was great because i felt so safe. At the entry there is a security booth a metal detector before you walk in the hotel and security staff at the doors.Beautiful hotel in all only lacked a bit in the SPA area. It could use a bit of renovating and updating but other than that the four seasons was a great stay.

Typical of four seasons hotels this hotel is really beautiful. The lobby was filled with beautiful roses and the gardens were a delight to walk through. The hotel grounds are spacious enough so even at full capacity it doesnt feel like its full.    We were warmly greeted upon arrival and decided to have a welcome drink which was delicious. The room was spacious and had a huge balcony to our delight with sun loungers if we decided we wanted some privacy from the main pool.    As usual the customer service was spot on. Everyone was polite and helpful and we had a very friendly waitress at dinner who was so passionate about her job it was a delight to see.  On one night we had Moroccan style food at the restaurant next to the lobby. The food was divine especially their chicken tagine which is also a traditional dish of Morroco.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Travellicious_A83 wrote a review Sep 2019,10,Dont trust them for booking any excursion through the hotel,On Reccomendation of a staffmember named Jihan (guest experience) we booked different excursions trough the hotel.  We booked a citytour guide included history/monuments of Marrakech. The guide who was linked to us brought us only to shops and we didn't get a lot to see of the city Marrakech. Afterwards it looked like the guy was working with the shopowners who was trying to sell us a lot. The sellers were very pushy we spend more then $25.000 on carpets jewelrycaftans and more.  We also booked trough the hotel (Jihan) a deserttrip including camelride en quadbike and that was a horrible experience. The quad had 2 times a breakdown and as if that wasn't enough we had to wait 1hour for fuel to continue our ride. We arrived in Agafay Anari Camps for dinner. The host that night was the owner of the place a French guy who was very cold and absolutly not friendly. The hospitality that we are used to get for the amount of money we paid was far to find.  Arriving in the hotel we discussed our experience with the staff of the hotel and they told us that they would give us discount on the trips but at last they let us pay the full bill without any discount they promissed.,Date of stay: March 2019,,"New York City, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travellicious_A83
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,smrpenn wrote a review Sep 2019,50,An Oasis in the Desert,I just spent four amazing nights at what is now one of my favorite places in the world (Marrakech) at this large Property. It is extremely well located literally within eyesite of the airport. But you wouldn't know it. It's serene peaceful and you don't have to leave (but you do because Marrakech is so amazing). This is a Property with residences rooms and villas built on 2011. Rooms are large with spacious pools (one for adults and one for families though I recall seeing kids at the adult pool). The Property does show its age. And some may state that it could be anywhere and that's a fit assessment IF you're comparing it to its legendary competition which is La Mamounia Royal Mansour The Mandarin and The Selman but you should not. Outside of the Mandarin and the Selman the other two are legendary grande dames where if you aren't dressed up (ie. No shorts trainers travel bags hats...which you MUST have when it's 110 degrees) you will either not be allowed in or feel a fool. It's more relaxed here and I liked that. Also it's not a riad experience. This was my first time to Marrakech and I stayed here because I wanted consistency and knew that I'd come back from the 110 degree heat and not want to care about being sweaty and exhausted. The service was awesome. Had a superb tour of the Medina and sites thanks to them. The bellman and those at the entrance are incredible. The generous bottled water shows mercy in the heat. It's close to everything but still it's own sanctuary. Finally the security was great. Loved it. I'm sure it'll get a touch up soon considering all of the competition. But this is my top choice and recommendation outside of said grande dames.,Date of stay: August 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Brooklyn, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/smrpenn

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Sarah D wrote a review Aug 2019,50,Fantastic stay,We had an absolutely fantastic 2 night stay here a few weeks ago. We stayed in a Premier Garden-View Terrace room and it was absolutely stunning. The room was huge and beautiful even better than the photos online made it look. My favorite part of the room was the terrace it had a really cool couch built into the side of the wall set back in an archway. I spent most of my time in the room in the evenings laying out there. Although the room was the most basic type of room at the hotel it was far different than your usual basic hotel room. There was a ton of space in the living area even with the dining table there. Forget about your typical tiny hotel closets this one was walk-in. We stored all our luggage in there and had room to open all our bags and leave them open so we didn't have to unpack all the way. The bathroom was also not your typical small hotel bathroom the toilet was behind its own door double vanity sinks incredibly huge soaking tub and separate shower with pretty tile work. Seriously words cannot describe how much space the room had both in the bedroom area and the bathroom and the terrace was huge. The furnishings were all comfortable and beautiful with definite Moroccan touches. I could have stayed in our room all day and I wish I had booked an extra day for us to do just this. Our favorite part of our stay was actually the room service breakfast. We are not room service people it's usually stupidly expensive and not good at all so we only order it when we're desperate. While in Morocco we decided we didn't want to bother having to find breakfast out in the city we wanted to just be able to start our touring plans early as we only had a couple days there so we decided to give room service a try. I am so so glad we did it was the highlight of our entire time in Morocco which sounds ridiculous but it was just so lovely. The food was excellent and they went above and beyond with the entire meal. It arrived on this cool rolling table thing (was basically a table on a cart base but looked like a normal table) at exactly the time we specified on the card and they asked us if we wanted it inside or out. We decided on out and they set it up so one side of the table faced the couch on the terrace and they pulled a chair up to the other side. It was so luxurious feeling and the presentation was beautiful. Between the two days we were there we tried the pancakes french toast eggs tagine scrambled eggs and sausage fruit plate oatmeal yogurt and mint tea and each breakfast came with a basket of yummy breads with jams and butter. Everything was fantastic it didn't taste like room service food it tasted like it was fresh from a nice cafe. We also enjoyed the amenities around the hotel we spent a few hours one afternoon cooling off in the adult pool. They have 2 pools: A family pool and an adult pool that is very quiet and calm. Service at the pool was excellent the minute we walked up towards the chairs we wanted someone came right over and put towels on the chairs and brought us a cooler full of bottles of water. They also came around with popsicles! It was the best way to cool off in the summer heat. The common areas of the hotel are luxurious and beautiful as are the grounds and gardens. The lobby even has cute little birds in it that I really enjoyed going to visit. Service all around was excellent. The bellmen were always handing us bottles of water when we arrived and left and they were very helpful in telling the taxi drivers where to go and ensuring they were going to stick to the quoted price (it was 50 dirhams everywhere we went from the hotel not sure where the radius of that price point ends but to get to the Medina Majorelle Gardens and the surrounding areas it was always 50). The front desk staff were also very helpful they provided some great recommendations around the city and exchanged some money for us. When we arrived at first our room wasn't ready so they put us in a golf cart and drove us back to the changing rooms at the gym pavilion to freshen up and change clothes. Then they drove us back around to the lobby stored our bags and we were off for the day. There was quite a line at the check-in desk when we arrived and they weren't the fastest but when you're providing excellent service and going above and beyond you're bound to lose some efficiency in the process so it was understandable. The location is great as well it's very close to the airport but not so close that the airplane noise is a bother and it's close to town yet still feels like a total escape from the city. You will need to take cabs from the hotel as there's nothing really in walking distance but that's the price you pay to have a bit of space and seclusion from the craziness of it all and it's well worth it. Even if you have to take a cab two round trips to and from the hotel each day it's typically only around 220 dirhams total for those 4 rides (gotta negotiate with the cab drivers when you're catching them in town we were usually able to barter down to around 50 by threatening to walk away at their quoted prices). This was just an incredible resort experience all around when our time in Marrakech was up and we headed back to London we were ready to leave the city but not the hotel and we missed it a lot! Will definitely be staying here every single time I return to Marrakech. You cannot go wrong by choosing this resort.,Date of stay: July 2019,,"Denver, Colorado",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarahd299

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,TRIPMCFC wrote a review Aug 2019,50,Luxury hotel away from the chaos,This is a fantastic hotel which is a lovely retreat from the chaos of central Marrakech - but it also close enough to easily go into the centre for food and exploring.    Highlights;  - Breakfast is delicious lots of choice and fresh.  - The adults pool - the service is great even in the heat the staff are running around making sure everyone is happy (bringing complimentary treats topping up your water etc.) and the pool is a great temperature in the Marrakech summer heat.  - The rooms are very spacious and comfortable and the cleaning staff were always very efficient twice a day. The decor in the room was stylish but in keeping with Morrocan style as was the entire hotel.  - The staff in general were extremely friendly and helpful. They were also all willing to provide recommendations and chat about Marrakech in general.  - The gym was great and modern - as a nice touch it had infused cold water cold towels etc. for once you had finished your session.    To be honest the whole experience of staying here was fantastic - the only slight negative is that they food and drink prices were high so we chose to eat out every evening (don't pay more than 50dhs for any taxi to / from hotel).,Date of stay: August 2019,,"Manchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TRIPMCFC
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,bhavchande wrote a review Aug 2019,40,"Nice hotel, but not central",Hotel - beautiful hotel situated just 10 mins from the airport. Set in superb grounds full of palm trees olive trees and planting. Looks stunning and 2 big pools. Free WiFi in all rooms and at the pool.    Location - Only 10 mins from the airport but you only hear the odd plane now and again so that’s not an issue at all. If you get a taxi from the airport it should cost no more than 100 dirhams (£10) so don’t get ripped off. I wrongly assumed the hotel was fairly central and that we could walk to local restaurants so went B&B which was a mistake. With a young child getting out is in fact a short taxi ride into Marrakech. Was planning on eating out most nights but we only managed two night time outings. If you don’t fancy getting a taxi every night then suggest you go half board but only 2 restaurants to choose from.    Tour - We did book a half day tour through the hotel and the guide Mohammed was superb taking us to the Bahia Palace souks and main square. It was just right if you’re looking for a brief history of the city. Interesting place but if I’m being honest the old town and souks and main square was a bit of a dump dirty smelly and hot. Maybe I just saw the bad/wrong parts wasn’t that impressed!!! Expected a lot better.    Room - we booked a pool view terrace room and it was lovely a good size the terrace was large and really nice views of the pool and gardens and mountains. The bathroom was large and the shower was superb.    Pools - 2 nice pools. One is adults only so we couldn’t use that (we have an 8-year old) but it looked fabulous. The family pool is nice and big split into 2 but only 1.25 metres deep. Ok for little kids but would have preferred a deeper pool. Lots of sun beds and towels and the staff around the pool are great.    Restaurants - a great looking poolside restaurant next to the adult pool (we never used it preferring to order at the poolside instead). However only 2 main restaurants at the hotel I was expecting more than this. Both OK but pricey ... usual 5* hotel prices. Breakfast is brilliant a buffet style with lots of choice. The orange juice is the freshest I’ve ever tasted and health smoothies were great.    Reception - the only real complaint I have was with some of the reception staff. E.g. I asked them to book us a table at one of their recommended restaurants in Marrakesh to be told later it had been done however when we got to the restaurant they didn’t have any booking! E.g. on the last night I enquired about a late check out the next day to be abruptly told by a lady (I won’t mention her name!) that she will come back to me later (why couldn’t she check immediately for me?). I knew she wouldn’t bother to come back to me when she asked my room number but didn’t bother to write it down. I was right. No call back. Had to go back later that evening and this time they sorted it out and we were given a very nice room next morning (no extra charge) and our luggage was transferred for us and we were able to check out 3pm.    Overall I would recommend this hotel for a quiet relaxing stay for couples or families. It needs another dinner restaurant to give more choice. Location not great if you want to get out and about into Marrakech you cannot walk anywhere.,Date of stay: August 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Worsley, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bhavchande
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Simon S wrote a review Aug 2019,50,"Beautiful hotel and wonderful, spacious grounds and gardens with excellent service",Four seasons is a quality brand and this hotel is no exception. We had an upper pavilion room which was clean and spacious. Service from the staff from the reception to room to the pool and the restaurants was impeccable. This included being good English speakers although the majority of the guests were French.    We're not totally convinced about the Moroccan wines the hotel offered; quite expensive for the quality but we did want to go local. The restaurant food was excellent; and when we asked for something that was listed on the online menu but not the one we were handed they made the meal for us anyway; a nice touch.    The breakfast buffet was very good with a wide selection of cakes and pastries; it was included in our package.    The gardens are beautiful and spacious so you aren't aware of other guests except at the quiet pool and at the restaurants.    The hotel security seems very thorough. Be aware that it seems impossible to get to the hotel from the airport for less than a hundred dirham even though it's a shorter journey than to the city. (seventy dirhams)    We got a good deal going through British Airways holidays; August is not high season due to the heat. It is very hot in the day but the nights are cool; after 8pm and before 11am the temperature is quite bearable.,Date of stay: August 2019,,"Sutton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/simonsU5398PD

My wife and I have just spent a week at the Four Seasons Marrakech and we are already suffering withdrawal symptoms!!  The breakfasts were the best I have ever found anywhere in the world (and I travel up to 100 each year!)  The gym was superb extremely well equipped for all levels of guests .. from the very occasional visitor - to twice daily gym bunnies like me!  The rooms are sumptuous and very Moroccan in style.  The food is fantastic (check out the pastas and pizzas in Quattro and the tagine in Inara).  The cocktails are superb and every evening the hotel has excellent live music.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Tish wrote a review Aug 2019,50,Heaven in the form of a hotel,My boyfriend and I recently stayed for a week and wished we had booked for longer. From the moment we arrived we were treated like royalty.  Location : 10/10. 15 mins in car from airport. 15 mins to Médina. 10 mins to new city. The four seasons have fixed price of 50 MAD (<£5) for any taxi ride to these areas.  Food:  Four seasons offer 2 great restaurants; Inara and Quattro. The food for both is great if a little expensive. But ideal as an alternative to going out and eating. The breakfast buffet is similar to that of any 5* Hotel.  Amenities:  Two fab pools amazing spa 2 clay tennis courts with optional coach (extra cost) state of the art fitness equipment young adult centre including basketball hoop table tennis snooker etc.  Service:  This Is what really sets apart the four seasons above any other hotel we have been to. All the staff ranging from the cleaners to the front desk went above and beyond to ensure we didn’t have to think about anything whilst on holiday. They have a fantastic concierge messaging app who will deal with any query. E.g ice buckets sent to room booking a dinner reservation outside of hotel guides excursions. There really wasn’t any query that left unsolved.  We didn’t manage to get everyone’s names but Hanane at the front desk was delightful.  A huge thank you to all of the four seasons staff and we 100% recommend this hotel to anyone looking to book a holiday in Marrakech!!,Date of stay: August 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/servicetish
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,sahara_1976 wrote a review Aug 2019,50,Spectacular !!,We stayed at the Four seasons Marrakech from the 11th July for 4 nights in the Pavilion Room we emailed the hotel few months in advance for early check in which they managed to adhere the hotel is extravagant with great hospitality. Our room was very spacious for family of three the bouquet of roses and cookies which were left for us on the first day was a nice gesture the bathroom was very grand and the outside balcony (pavilion) was great to sit out in. My daughter was provided with a roller bed which she said was very comfortable too our bed was so divine and we were guaranteed a good night sleep. The breakfast was nice but they could have extended the hot menu and the omelette station was a bit slow at times but overall we enjoyed the special dishes and the fresh drinks every morning. Four seasons location is away from the hustle and bustle but just a short taxi ride to the souk and gueliz area. The hotel does provide a service to the souk in the evening but we never used it. Four seasons provided an excellent service  they listened to all our needs and also on the day we were leaving I asked for late checkout which they were able to extend. I would definitely have no hesitation to book this hotel again.,Date of stay: July 2019,,"Leeds, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sahara_1976

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Neel Bhattacharjee wrote a review Aug 2019,50,"Classic FS service, food and resort experience",I stayed here for a few nights with family who were staying at an FS resort for the first time. All of us loved the stunning grounds of the property typically larger than expected rooms and (in our experience contrary to other experience) high quality food across cuisines. Breakfast was a highlight every day - overlooking the water and trees if you can get a spot in the shade outside. The Morroccan restaurant we had on the first night and was probably the best meal we had in the city. The Italian restaurant too was a surprise - comparable to high end establishments I've been to around the world. Great gym and pool facilities too which we used daily backed by friendly and attentive service by the team. We all can't wait to go back - thanks to the entire team and Blaise for running such a tight ship.

The garden is gorgeous. The breakfast is just delicious with an immense variety of food! The room is spacious the bed is like a cloud.  The bathroom is very beautiful in marocain style.  👎🏻The adult pool 🏊🏾‍♀️ is too shallow for swimming only 130m of depth. The water in the pool is too hot when the air is 38C the water in the pool should be much cooler to give a refreshing feeling rather than a hot feeling.  The jacuzzi is not working very well.  The food served at the pool is of low quality.  There’s no Matcha Tee or Matcha Latte in any of hotel restaurants.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,HelenaNetherlands wrote a review Jul 2019,40,good but....,Four seasons Marrakech good but….    my daughter and I stayed at the four seasons Marrakech the first week of July. We stayed in a superior room with a nice balcony. The grounds and gardens are beautiful well kept and a pleasure to walk in. The smell in the hotel is wonderful we bought a bottle to use it at home     When we arrived at Menara airport in Marrakech the hotel pickup did not show up and we had to wait and after several calls the driver arrived It’s a short drive from the airport tot the hotel. At check in nobody seemed to know that we had to call several times for the airport pickup so no explanation at all.  The room layout is somewhat peculiar a small hall with a minibar and coffee and tea making facilities just at the door into the bathroom.  The furniture is a bit dated; one chair on the balcony was damaged the tiled floor in the bathroom has stains that will never come out and the bathtub is a bit dingy.    Food at several restaurants is decent wine is expensive but fine service at breakfast is a bit hit and miss. Breakfast spread is rather small but tasty and fresh orange juice is served at the table. Moroccan oranges and other fruits are the best!    The hotel had a high occupancy and that showed at the pools. Rather busy at times. The lady at the spa is a lovely lady and as we had a late flight home she let us use the spa facilities before leaving.    All in al we had a nice time. Marrakech is a beautiful city. The government invested a lot in the infrastructure of the city and it turned out to be a very good investment.    FS Marrakech is not completely up to FS standards; that is why I can not give 5 stars.,Date of stay: July 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,Netherlands,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HelenaNetherlands

The girls on reception were so helpful in booking any tours restaurants and dealt with anything we asked them to do in such an efficient manner. We had our own driver Youness for the few days who made our whole experience to Marrakesh a wonderful experience we felt very safe for the whole trip and for us he made our trip a much more wonderful experience we also had our own guide for any of the excursions we went on ie. The Atlas Mountains & a trip to the Old City which included the Souks. The hotel recommended some restaurants which we tried and we could not fault them we tried the breakfast in the hotel which was really good and the food was very good in the restaurant beside the pool and the Italian was excellent too and such a beautiful setting overlooking the garden. We had a suite beside the family pool and it was beautiful. We are a family of 5 so we had loads of room.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,percy d wrote a review Jul 2019,50,You will love it,"The vast majority of tripadvisor reviewers agree that the Four Seasons Resort Marrakech and all the people working for this luxury hotel earn an ""Excellent"" rating.    I would even go beyond that: The Four Seasons Resort Marrakech ist one of the best places to be in order to discover Marrakesh and its local region. We loved our large rooms the wide garden areas the breakfast buffet and the wonderful pool areas. We were really happy that the hotel is not directly in the Medina but bee line 2 kilometres outside of city's center. A little bit like an oasis. The good thing is that most places you will typically like to visit are only 5 to 10 minutes away via taxi (and taxi rides are really inexpensive in Marrakesh).    Some people are concerned that the airport is only 1 to 2 kilometers away. However first it is worth noticing Marrakesh airport is pretty close to the center of the city. So the fact of having an airport close to you is true for about 50% of Marrakesh. The good thing is that this airport is beautiful but pretty small. It has only one runway that is perpendicular to the bee line between the Four Seasons and the airport so the noise of starting aircrafts is directing away from the Four Seasons. Landing aircrafts aren't noticable at all.    Lastly a big compliment is going to all the people working for the Four Seasons and the hotel's management. There are so many outstanding friendly and perfectly organized people anticipating your wishes without being intrusive.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,mr0ckwell wrote a review Jul 2019,10,"Gorgeous Resort, Most Frustrating Service I've ever Experienced","I am a person who NEVER writes reviews. While the facilities were very beautiful and quite well maintained the service was the worst that my husband and I have ever experienced at ANY hotel we've ever stayed at. We ate once at the Italian restaurant and twice at the pool-side restaurant and each time we waited 15-minutes before a waiter came to take our order. Twice a menu item that we ordered was not received. Also twice the drinks we ordered did not come until we had finished our meal. Each time we had to ask a MINIMUM of three times for the check. At the Italian restaurant we waited over 20-minutes despite asking THREE different servers for the bill. We eventually just left knowing that they could charge it to our room. The pool-side service was even more atrocious. We asked for an umbrella to be moved three times each time we were told they would do it for us right away - we sat at the pool for three hours and no one brought our umbrella. The second time we visited the pool we requested a pool basket with water as we walked in and waited ONE hour (after three additional requests) before it was delivered. We waited 45-minutes before waving down another server to order wine. We told what seemed to be the pool-side manager how long we had been waiting - he finally went and brought the drinks however it was another hour before he ""stopped by to check on us"" which I thought was very much lacking after we had expressed to him our strong frustration earlier on. We were just shocked that we could experience service that we would consider terrible at ANY establishment be it a local bar or neighborhood taco shop at the Four Seasons. This was literally the worst service experience I can remember. Very very disappointing - to the point that I would not recommend this resort to others as it significantly sullied our stay.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Judy Z wrote a review Jun 2019,50,Consummate luxury hotel in Marrakech,Marrakech is as they say a very 'touristic' city - even during Ramadan. We were amazed at the dedication and service of the staff during this holy time when people are going sunrise to sunset without food or drink.  The Four Seasons is always a great choice for a hotel but this one really excels in its location and its grounds - gigantic gardens that are beautiful and peaceful to stroll early morning before the heat and crowds settle in.  Rooms are lovely. We had one with a huge terrace and though the food is excellent in the restaurants we often had room service on the terrace. It was lovely to hear the extra (and extra long) call to pray in the evening sung beautifully from a nearby mosque.,Date of stay: May 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Salt Lake City, Utah",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/judyz2

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Kevin R wrote a review Jun 2019,50,Beautiful Hotel in Marrakech,Stayed here for a week with my family in June. Great location and beautiful hotel. Just 10 mins form the airport and 15 mins into the centre of Marrakech. All that you would expect from a luxury hotel. We had a premier garden view terrace room which was spacious and well furnished with a large bathroom and walk-in wardrobe. The grounds of the hotel are very pleasant with palm trees and extensive gardens. Two lovely large swimming pools with lots of sun loungers as well as shade from the sun if required - and a supply of chilled bottled water. Great air-conditioned gym facilities and two tennis courts (- great fun for a knock around!).    Several restaurants on-site all serving a good mix of international and Moroccan food. The breakfast buffet was the best I've ever come across and the Moroccan buffet in the Quattro restaurant (when available) was excellent with a huge range of food from around the world. And of course there are great restaurants all over Marrakech which is only 15 mins away.    Staff were very friendly and helpful throughout.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,pmsnowdon wrote a review Jun 2019,50,A rather perfect stay at this much improved hotel,This was our second visit to the FS Marrakech. We stayed in 2016 and it really seems to have improved in terms of FS standards. It’s prettier the service more attentive and we had a wonderful week here all-in-all.    It was my birthday and we were very kindly upgraded to a suite from an Upper Pavilion King Room. I actually preferred the latter as the room dimensions and views were stunning (highly recommend this level of room!). All-in-all all staff knew us by name they knew our preferences and we met Pierre (the GM) who was at pains to meet us after a little issue we had.    The BEST thing is the 24hr conceirge by chat message! Download the FS app on your phone and you can simply ask the conceirge anything by text message. We were ordering ice buckets for the room when at the pool asking them to book/change evening reservations while in a taxi and they even went out and picked up some pain killers from a pharmacy for me - all done by instant messenger and all done with ease and a very friendly nature - nothing was too much trouble. This is GOLD DUST especially if you’re new to Marrakech.    We LOVED it here and will return for a third time. Well done to GM Pierre for elevating this hotel to TRUE FS status.

Our stay started with a welcome from the GM as we got out of the car from the airport.  Overall staff were incredibly kind and attentive.  Food was good particularly breakfast. Only peeve was having to somewhat compete with non-residents for a dinner table particularly for a table on the terrace. But staff did their best to accommodate.  We spent so much time around the family pool: large 2 parts with diff. temps nicely configured poolside so there were distinct areas and you didn't feel on top of each other. As soon as you approach pool staff find you loungers (even when packed) then bring fresh towels and an ice box with bottles of water.  Our room - Upper Pavilion - was perfect for the 3 of us (couple + 8 yo boy): spacious very well appointed very comfy beds large terrace with view of the pool/gardens.

Good location about 10 minute drive from airport and without airport noise pollution. 10 min taxi drive to medina. Best asset of the hotel is their staff who are always friendly and nothing is too much bother for them. Definitely will return as the place is so relaxing.    Location  Edge of City near airport. Beautiful gardens immaculately maintained and fantastic pools - one adults only which was great.    Service  In all respects excellent. Starting with the excellent security then the Front Office which was highly efficient and incredibly helpful. Housekeeping very good. Restaurant pool and bar staff excellent who looked after us incredibly well. I would particularly like to mention Kamal who looked after us at breakfast Ms Matilda in the bar area and the boys at the pool Hamza and Amen.    Room  Excellent in size but then we were upgraded to patio suite with pool which was a beautiful surprise. Kept immaculately by housekeeping.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,jinkz89 wrote a review Jun 2019,10,Hard to have a relaxing vacation with such poor service,"I stayed here May 29 2019-June 1 2019 and had an awful experience with the staff and service. Upon check-in I was not given the option to select whether my bill would be charged in the local currency MAD or USD. Upon checkout I signed my bill which indicated the charge in local currency. At no point was I asked whether I wanted the bill to be charged on my credit card in local currency. I was in a rush to get to the airport so I did not have a chance to review my bill until arriving at the airport. At this point I realized that the hotel charged my entire bill in USD and charged a 3.5% currency exchange fee. It would be an understatement to say that I was shocked - I have an international credit card and like most other places and normal practices I assumed the hotel would charge me in local currency instead of charging me a conversion fee to charge my bill in USD without asking.    Here is where the situation gets even better. I called the hotel and explained the situation asked that they re-do the transaction in local currency as I signed on my bill. They refused alleging that I agreed to be charged in USD upon check. Nope. Totally false. The lady upon checkin took my credit card away from me and I not given any option or opportunity to decide how my bill was going to be charged. After 10-minutes of back and forth the lady said she will ""speak to her manager."" This is complete nonsense - this needs to be fixed or I will escalate this via my credit card company to void the entire transaction.    Other notable highlights from our stay at the Four Seasons Marrkech:    One of the days at the pool we placed a drink and food order. Our drink order was served. We waited ~60 minutes for our food order yet nothing arrived. Upon checking with the staff about our food we were told that the waiter that took our order never actually placed it with the kitchen. What?? It's not that hard to put in a food order and no one should have to wait 1.5 hours for 2 sandwiches.    The next day we had a similar awful experience again at the pool. Given the 105 F degree temperature we requested an umbrella by the pool. We were given an umbrella however while we were enjoying the pool it was taken away from us. I requested that our umbrella be replaced and was told ok. After my first requested I has to ask not one not two but *three* more times for an umbrella over the course of 45 minutes for the staff to actually bring me an umbrella. It was the worst service that I have ever experience in my life. No apologies for the delay or anything. I requested to speak to a manager about this awful poor service and he did nothing to redress the situation.    I've stayed at many different resorts and this has been the worst experience of all. I have a booking at the Four Seasons in Boston later this year which I am going to cancel after this awful experience.

A Truly 5 Star Hotel,We have just returned from a 4 night stay and loved it so much that we have just rebooked again for July! We have been going to Dubai for many years and the standard of 5 star hotels there are falling each time. Was so nice to visit the four seasons in Marrakesh and experience 5 star service and surroundings again.    The service and experience was absolutely amazing. We would have trouble finding fault in anything.    Our first night we ate at the Italian Quattro - the service was second to none. Attentive waiters and very friendly. The food and wine was fantastic.    Breakfast was perfect  a great selection of foods. In particular the selection of fruit  freshly made juices and the Bircher stood out for me. We both looked forward to breakfast each day! The waiter brought us  Over a Moroccan dish to try one morning which was a nice touch.    During our stay we experienced the gym which was very well equipped with water and fruit available. We also had a 45 minute back neck and shoulder massage and used the spa facilities which were fantastic and very relaxing.    Housekeeping was particularly impressive! Rooms serviced to a very high standard twice a day. Even when we left to go out at 9pm we would get back to find we had still been turned down.    We used both the adult pool and family pool. Lounges are all set up ready to use with towels. Thoughtful extras like sun lotions straw hats are available to use and sorbets and lollies are brought around at certain points of the day.    We ate at the pool restaurant for lunch twice. The food was gorgeous and the drinks are reasonably priced for a 5 star hotel. We usually stay in Dubai where a glass of white wine would be £15 but it was just £7.50 here.    We had a pool view terrace suite and were really pleased we have chosen that room. The room was large with a separate dressing room and a bathroom with a deep bath and walk in shower.    I also have to mention the roses - there are fresh roses everywhere!

As it was something small we decided to let it go. Our last night in the hotel as we started to pack my mother again realised that the cover of one of her bags was missing. Which was placed INSIDE HER LUGGAGE and the luggage was CLOSED while we were out touring around Marrakech. After looking for it everywhere and I could not find it I went to the reception and I explained what happened very politely and they said they going to have a look. Long story short they didnt find it while we were still there and when I came home and I unpacked everything I noticed that one of my rings is missing too. Again I send them an email to let them know and now my ring still cannot be found.  It is someone's choice to stay in a 5* hotel and paying all these money as we want our comfort good facilities cleanliness good food and drinks feeling safe secured and the list can go on and on but we are not paying all these money for someone to steal things from us! I admit that my mistake was not to keep it on the safe but I trusted a FIVE STAR HOTEL like Four Seasons which in general is a great company! It is ridiculous and disappointing. This ring not only was expensive but it was the first gift that my partner gave me and it is GONE! because someone from a 5* hotel decided to take it either by mistake and decided to not return it or by choice.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,CurlyGirl14 wrote a review Apr 2019,50,Great family break,We had a great family break in 4 seasons Marrakesh. It was perfect for a short break with the kids and we’d highly recommend. The staff were a huge plus...so attentive and amazingly patient with the kids. Mehdi and his team by the pool were great and the staff on reception so helpful advising and organising trips. Our room was fantastic and the food from breakfast to dinner to room service was top notch. All in all a great stay...thanks to all at 4 seasons!

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,nickgreen1 wrote a review Apr 2019,40,A good option.,Four Seasons hotels come with reasonably high expectations so with that in mind my review -    Rooms are terrific. We had two interconnecting Upper Pavillion rooms. Excellent all round lovely terraces. We also had a garden patio room which was also very nice.    Lunch and dinner are great - both in food and value.    Service is also great. Lovely friend people. Happy to help.    Grounds are lovely and very well looked after.    But as with all hotels there are a few niggles. Breakfast is not great. The buffet room resembles a motorway service station and is dark. It needs to be re-done. The kids pool is half heated and half is a cold pool - forces everyone to be in the warm pool which is then crowded. The tennis court is old and is overlooked by a building site (four seasons residences). The young adults club has a table tennis table which is not level and needs replacing which shouldn't be the case - especially during high kids easter season.    They will fix most of the above I'm sure. The biggest issue for me they can't fix. The actual hotel size. It feels a bit small - especially for Marrakesh. Unlike some of the others that have large space it feels like its a 30second walk from your room to the pool to the hotel borders to breakfast to lunch. It should be stretched by around 30metres in every direction which obviously they can't do.    So in the end if you are looking for an easy 3hr flight from London a 10min taxi ride to a nice hotel with lovely staff and food it does have it - but its not the best Four Seasons property and possibly not the best in Marrakesh. But its nice so remains a good option for a family break.,Date of stay: April 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nickgreen1

We come for 3 to 4 days with family friends or both. The reason why we are not tempted to experience another resort of a similar category is simply because we have found here exactly what we were looking for: A beautiful Hotel with splendid gardens and 2 large swimming pools a quality of the management that shows in the attention of the staff  the quality of the service and the extremely well maintained hotel. We like to go out in the morning after breakfast to enjoy the shopping in Marrakech then we go back to have a lunch by the swimming pool and we enjoy the afternoon there.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,ShanghaiKevin78 wrote a review Apr 2019,40,Excellent hotel and resort,We stayed there for a week in 3/2019 we got the room with private small diving pool the room is spacious and loverly.  The staffs and the front dest as well as at the hotel entrance are wonderful and helpful.    We have arranged a few tours with hotel they were all great. The camel ride in dessert are of a lot of fun especially with a bunch of kids. It is almost like glamping in the dessert. I personally think the fire man show during the dinner in the dessert is a must see with the wonderful music playing the background of dessert.    We took a number of trips to Medina with the tour guide provided through the hotel. They are all wonderfully helpful.    There is ATM in the hotel so it is rather east to get cash except it was broken one day I did exchange some $ to cash at the front (the exhange rate is not great) so ATM is the best way to get cash.    We left kids in the kid club one day the kids had a lot fun in kids club the staffs in kids club are great.    We even got baby sitters through the hotel one night without any problem.    It is east to get rider with taxi or hotel car to any of the restaurants in town although I suggest you need to ask the hotel staff how much the taxi cost when coming back to the hotel.    The pool is also heated in 1/2 of area.    The only place slightly less than ideal is the food in the morocco restaurant at the hotel it is obviously expensive and not up to par.  However the breakfast is great with extensive selections. All the staffs are wonderfully helpful.,Date of stay: March 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"New York City, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShanghaiKevin78
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,aisha a wrote a review Apr 2019,20,Not four seasons quality - EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED -,We were extremely disappointed by the quality of service. We faced some issues before arrival as we had booked a room in the upper pavilion unaware that it was a separate building. Once we had discovered this mistake it became an absolute nightmare trying to change the reservation. We had spoken to everyone without any progress and were left with no other option than to speak to the secretary of the general manager to try to quell our problem who luckily was able to help us.    This should have been an indication of what was to come. The concierge failed to get back to us on numerous occasions regarding the reservations that we tried make.    The hotel is unusually noisy with doors slamming at the break of dawn. Airplanes can be heard flying overhead after my sister had complained they offered to upgrade her to a suite. There were insects crawling all over the suite and despite her complaints she returned night after night to find insects.    The biggest trouble was that the staff were unable to understand us despite speaking both English and Arabic. We visited Riad’s in marrakesh who had a better grasp of both languages.    Our phone calls often went unanswered which again is quite unusual for a hotel of this ranking. The concierge and the reception simply do not answer the phone! We had to call room service/spa in order to have our call transferred to someone who could help us.    The TV did not work upon arrival. This is a strange for the four seasons.    The only saving grace of the hotel is the lobby area which has a nice ambiance.

We were made to feel special from the moment we entered it was so genuine and not forced. That is a skill in itself! The concierge arranged our trips with such ease and they were truly unforgettable especially the camel trip to the Agafay desert we will never go through travel companies again. Nothing was too much trouble. The hotel arranged a private transfer on the evening to the Medina. He was there to collect us at the time we had asked for. We had booked our own private transfer with the airline normally we see our name displayed at arrivals but couldn’t see anything. We found a man from Four Seasons who straight away made calls and helped us find where our transfer was so very kind. The room was beautiful so clean and I slept like a baby. The resort is so tranquil I loved ambling round the gardens the flowers were so beautiful and listening to the sound of the birds. We had a lovely day by the pool again looked after like royalty but I didn’t want to abuse it or take it for granted like many others. We ate every evening in the Inra restaurant I loved listening to the Moroccan man playing the traditional music. As for the food I have never tasted food as delicious in my life and we have eaten at Michelin star restaurants they don’t come close. They treated like celebrities which I find so humbling. Breakfast was fantastic my husband is going to miss the freshly squeezed orange juice so much. To celebrate 25 years of marriage in a Hotel like this is incredible and the memories will stay with us forever. Thank you to all of you.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,467michaelc wrote a review Mar 2019,50,SHUKRAAN JAZILAAN!!!!,"Just returned from a week's stay at the Marrakech with family. 3 rooms. OUTSTANDING in virtually every way. Number one- the people. I cannot say enough about the care we received from absolutely everyone- from the moment of arrival to the instant of departure. Abderrahim greeted us upon arrival and attended to all our needs at the front desk/concierge throughout the stay. He is an absolute gem as is the entire front desk team. He set us up with a most amazing suite where everything was clean and of the absolute highest standard. Food at all 3 restaurants was superb. I want to mention Osama in particular at the casual ""Riad"" restaurant where music played daily. Osama didn't go the extra mile for us- he went the extra 10 miles. One day we were in the rec area playing pool ad he found us to deliver snacks and drinks. He always had a great table for us and personally picked some great wines he knew we'd enjoy. Loved the guitar in the evening as did my 6 year old. A special time. All of the excursions were arranged by the hotel and they were so much fun safe Fabulous guides and educational as well. The pool was great- although on the kids side there are some sharp edges on the stairs and walls into the pool that you must be careful not to get cut. Loved the very large property with ample areas to take walks. Not much to comment negatively about.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Susan wrote a review Mar 2019,20,"Bad recommendation to Agafay desert, very disappointed customers.",The reception recommended us a trip to Agafay desert. Let me start by saying that we had a really bad experience. The driver who took us didn't speak a word English and that made it very difficult for us to communicate. Arriving at the camp we have waited very long for the camels and also this guide didn't speak a word English either. The manager of the place was absolutly not friendly he was very cold and we didn't feel welcome. The hospitality was far to find and you dong expect that if you know what we have paid for this excursion. We had a very bad evening. We also were very disappointed in the transportation and that for an exclusive hotel as Four Seasons you expect more luxury and not a Renault. We felt like sitting in a schoolbus. My husband had notice this because we are used being transported in luxury cars like the first day they picked us up from the airport in a luxury car (Mercedes).  The stay at the hotel was good beautiful place good service and nice rooms.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,JMGJD wrote a review Mar 2019,50,Wish I could give it 10 stars!,We just returned from 4 nights at this magnificent resort. We were traveling with our children- ages 4 6 and 9 and chose this hotel because of its family friendly reputation. Besides being absolutely gorgeous (rooms and grounds) this hotel truly goes above and beyond in every way imaginable. My husband and I are avid travelers and have stayed at many luxury resorts and hotels around the world but have never experienced service like we did at the Four Seasons Marrakech. Before I go into smaller details I want to give an example of the level of service that you can expect at this resort. We had booked our stay through our travel agent who also booked us various tours and experiences in the city. One morning we were booked (by our travel agent) for a private family cooking class (that also included my parents who we were traveling with). When we arrived at the “cooking school” it was clear that our travel agent had been duped. It’s not worth going into details but I’ll leave it that we were in a remote location in the middle of the Medina and it was pretty scary. I texted the hotel through their app on my phone and explained the situation. They told me to sit tight and within a few minutes had us booked for another private cooking class and said that someone would be there to pick us up within 15 minutes. Less than 15 minutes later a gentleman arrived and escorted the 7 of us to the new cooking class (The Lotus Chef School) which was exactly the type of cooking experience we were looking for. The hotel truly saved the day! The concierge also arranged transportation back to the hotel for us after the cooking class and contacted the camel ride location that our travel agent had booked us on for that afternoon to make sure that it was legitimate and to also move the time back because of the delay we had in the morning. Because our day got pushed back it was too late to bring our children out for dinner with us that night. We asked the hotel if they could arrange a babysitter for our kids so that we could put them to sleep and go for dinner on our own but unfortunately all of the English speaking babysitters through their babysitting agency were taken. When I told the concierge to please cancel our dinner reservation because we couldn’t leave our children with a non English speaking babysitter he told me to give him a few minutes because he would “find a solution.” Again like the magic of the morning experience within a short time the hotel had arranged for one of the kids club staff members (the wonderful Fatima) to babysit so we could still go out. Moreover when they delivered the room service dinner we ordered for our children they also delivered a lovely dessert tower for us because they were so sorry for the bad experience (that was absolutely no fault of their own and that they miraculously fixed for us!) we had in the morning!  Other things worth mentioning- We had the hotel book us a guide for the souks and the guide was a million times better than the guide our travel agent booked for us for sightseeing around the city. Next time we will have the hotel book all excursions and activities for us because everything they booked was amazing. We were surprised with a generous room upgrade that provided us with incredible space for our family of 5. Our children’s room had multiple kid friendly touches (including an age appropriate toothbrush for each of them- showing us that management/staff actually took the time to look into our kids ages). The staff could not have been nicer or more accommodating. Whether we were in a restaurant on the grounds at the pool in a golf cart being transported- every single staff member we encountered was wonderful. There is a huge family pool where your children can splash and play without fear of disturbing adults (half of the pool is heated). Although my kids didn’t have time to spend in the kids club we checked it out and the staff was lovely and we are sure our kids would have enjoyed it if we had more time. There is very tight security to enter the resort which also gave us comfort. It was truly hard to say goodbye to this resort and the phenomenal staff and management yesterday morning. Our kids are already begging to go back and even though it’s a long trip from the NY area we hope to return next year!,Date of stay: March 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,JMGJD,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JMGJD
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,LondonHH72 wrote a review Mar 2019,50,The ultimate oasis!!!,My family and I just left The Four Seasons Marrakech a few days ago after a four night stay that was absolutely wonderful!    As our first trip to Marrakech and Morocco for that matter I had a difficult time trying to decide between La Villa des Orangers La Mamounia The Mandarin and The Four Seasons. I am so happy we chose to stay here. Truly the best decision.    Less than 10 minutes from the airport and the center of town. I originally thought it might be disadvantageous not to be located in the Medina. After touring we realized it was a relief. As exciting and lively as the Medina is; and as beautiful as some of the riads are the Medina is kind of gritty. The Four Seasons was a refuge from it all and a beautiful property at that. Not generic or void of a sense of “place.” Very well done. Great balance of Moroccan style with modern elements.    We arrived very late at night and yet we had a complete team waiting for us with big smiles. Not the “night shift.” We had a long travel day and being made to feel so welcome even at such a late hour was incredibly nice. Not surprising since this was a Four Seasons but all the same it was a great first impression.    We needed some items from housekeeping and my family asked if we could still possibly order room service despite the awful hour. Everything came quickly and was delivered beautifully. The rooms we were given were very nice but we were curious if an upgrade might be possible. The next morning we were told there would be a much better option available for us after exploring Marrakech. We returned from the Medina and the door was opened to our own...The Presidential Suite. There are upgrades and then there are UPGRADES. This was beyond spectacular. Huge gorgeous with views that were pure magic. However this was just one of many highlights of our stay. Relaxing poolside in the afternoons was a treat. Just heaven. Superb service throughout. I mean truly spot on. Warm personal polished and efficient. Our only gripe was that we wish we were staying longer in Marrakech to enjoy this incredible suite and the other amenities of the hotel. It was a real oasis. Loved it.

The driver was late and the hotel kindly reduced the cost of this pickup on request without any difficulty. The hotel itself was situated about 10 minutes from the airport so not very difficult to get to. In a great location in the city of Marrakech.    Overall the staff at the hotel were exceptional and felt they did go the extra mile. The customer service was fantastic. The hotel were aware that we were celebrating my wife's 30th Birthday and they kindly provided a complimentary room upgrade which was a nice touch. They also decorated the room and provided a delicious cake. The room service team were fantastic. We were able to easily order food in without difficulty which was great - we opted for Kech burger which was very tasty! I would highly recommend this hotel and would stay again.

The bedroom is comfortable with very poor lighting. You have to turn on every light in the room. The pillows are too soft and you need a firmer pillow. There are plenty of drawers and storage space for clothes and Toiletries and the room is spacious. Nice balcony. The air conditioning works well.The housekeeping needs attention as they often do not replace the bathroom shampoosgels etc or the capsules for the Nespresso machine. The Wifi could be improved as you often need to reconnect. The service in the restaurants is reasonable but the waiters often need to be summoned. Quattro restaurant for breakfast was very good and the chef made a good omelette.The food in Inara restaurant was average. The lighting on the terrace was so poor you could not see what you were eating.The Hotel merits 5 stars because of the lovely grounds but otherwise it is 4 star. Staff are warm and friendly. The signage in the grounds is good but needs attention in the Hotel.

We travelled with our 21 month old daughter and was impressed by how much thought FS had put into accommodating families.    We stayed in a garden room which had a lovely little terrace and plenty of space for the three of us. The rooms was modern and clean with Morrocan touches.    We were impressed by the fact the hotel provided us with not only a cot but also a baby bath baby products (shampoos and wash etc) and a special diaper bin.    We loved the fact that the hotel didn’t feel crowded. There are three pools in total too. Adult pool Family pool and a little baby pool. The family and baby pool were both heated too.    There was also a separate jacuzzi area.    We absolutely loved walking amongst the beautiful gardens around the hotel. Our Toddler daughter loved running along pathways and kept her entertained.    The kids club was definitely a highlight. They transformed it into a mini Kasbah. Our daughter went there every day. It had both an outdoor and indoor area with plenty of toys and entertainment. We were very Impressed!!!    We didn’t dine at any of the restaurants as we mainly stuck to in room dining and we really enjoyed the varied tasty options. The breakfast at Inara was great and had mixture of both continental hot and local breakfast.    The service was of a very high standard and staff was always on hand to help and assist.    I recommend you download the Four Seasons App. This app gives you so much information about the resort and we used the app daily to order the food.    We enjoyed the calmness amongst the hecticness of the Red City. The ambiance and setting was very relaxed and tranquil.

Security on entrance to the hotel is really good and was really professional and courteous. Our room was great and the pool area a real wow!! The grounds are so extensive and you could spend ages going from area to area. We tried the spa and spent a day in the relaxing area following our treatments. We spent every night at the Quatro restaurant where the the wonderful Piero as Head Chef was resident. He came out to us each occasion and delighted to serve us whatever we considered we wanted. I had one of the best risotto's ever two nights in a row. Specific mention has to be made to Tariq in the Quatro bar who delighted in making the most wonderful concoctions for drinks - he had smoke machines and all sorts of things creating a real theatre in all he did. He had me addicted to the Lemon sherbet Prosecco's - I cannot have anything else since trying them- I loved it!!. The pool area was a real wow and the most beautiful heated outdoor pool with wonderful sunbeds. The attendants very keen to offer water hats and suncream at any point and a fabulous pool restaurant serving wonderful food.In all I cannot wait to go back - we loved it and missing it already!!,Date of stay: January 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EMS1510

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,ZevenHertjes wrote a review Jan 2019,50,Luxury oasis in buzzing Marrakesh,"The Four Seasons Marrakesh was our first encounter with this luxury label. Expectations where high. Especially since the nightly rate stands out from almost any other accommodation in Marrakech.    The travel company arranged private transportation from the airport to the hotel. Transfer time is a maximum of 10 minutes.    After the “magical” Four Seasons gate opened we were very impressed with the wonderful driveway to the lobby area. Our bags were taken care of and we proceeded towards the reception for our check-in.    We were not offered welcome drinks or any check-in delicacies that are usually offered in this five star range. Check-in was very quick and we were guided on a golf cart to our pavilion patio room. The friendly receptionist firstly gave a tour of the resort making sure that we would know our way around. The grounds are quite magnificent and well kept.    Our room was spacious and the private terrace is a big plus: plenty of sun sun loungers and a big wall that provides a lot of privacy. There is a large bathroom with both a rain shower and a tub with extra depth separate toilet and bidet and a double sink.    All facilities were there but we thought there were not enough amenities provided. If there is a bath you would expect bath salt and/or enough shampoo conditioner and wash gel that would make it possible to shower and bath if you want to (especially for two people).  The amenities provided are not the same as the amenities provided in the Spa. The Four Seasons branded products and amenities in the Spa are of a higher quality and more luxurious.    On arrival there were local pastries and a fruit-bowl on the table in our room. We highly appreciated these welcome gestures. However the fruit-bowl was never replenished during our week. Staying at a five star resort of a premium brand you would expect (at least) daily fresh fruit. Especially since the entire garden was full of orange trees. Coffee and tea however is complimentary. The Nespresso coffee was also highly appreciated and was of better quality than the coffee that was served at breakfast. There is a daily turn down service but no extra's (or news papers) that you might expect when staying at the Four Seasons. A small gesture like a chocolate / or treat (or even a weather report) is usually the standard in most five star hotels.    Overall the room is very spacious very clean and provided much comfort but it did not have that luxury feeling that we were expecting: it was rather basic. *please check the bed in room 90 (it does not level out/ crooked to the top right).    We also recommend to have a resort guide in the room explaining all facilities and all options that are available to the hotel guests. There is an option via the TV for information but this is very limited.    We also recommend to adjust the timers of the lightening at the resort: if you have an early breakfast (7 in the morning) it is pitch dark outside and the hotel lights were already turned of. It would be best to have some light when navigating through from your room through the garden.    The breakfast was very good buffet style with an egg and pancake station. From a full English breakfast to fruits it is all available. One morning we encountered a large group that made breakfast quite a hassle. We recommend the hotel to host groups for breakfast in another section (for instance: upstairs). Also on the buffet is a tablet stating ""ask your server for our Moroccan specialities"". It would be best to have a menu stating all options including the marvellous juice options. Breakfast was included in our rate however we needed to sign the bill every day. I understand it serves the administrative process but it feels a bit strange signing a bill of approx 70 EUR a day for breakfast if it is included in your rate.    On the day of arrival we checked in quite late and decided to stay at the resort and have dinner in the Italian restaurant. The service was excellent. The staff made an effort to address you by your name and were most polite and excellent with their service: what a great team! We were hoping for pizza's but the menu stated ""pizzolis"" basically some sort of calzone pizza's that were the signature of this restaurant: our advice to the restaurant stick to regular pizza's.    Since we visited the hotel in January it was rather chilly. We used the outdoor heated hotel pool once. We were provided with water in a cooler and received a pear with cocos on a stick. These are the extras that you would expect when visiting a four seasons our compliments!    The spa was also wonderful. We received a tour and were guided to the locker room. Men and woman have their own facilities. There is a Haman a sauna a cold bath and a hot bath with whirlpool and waterfall. Tea and nuts and dry fruits are provided. As mentioned before the amenities and products in the Spa are more luxurious as the amenities and products that are provided in room. The gym is located at a different location. Basically all equipment is provided for a good exercise.    To travel from the resort to the medina you need a taxi. The concierge and security team were most friendly interested and correct. Excellent service! On our first trip out we received advice on the normal taxi rates; this was very helpful. When getting back to the resort we were friendly greeted by security with a smile and a friendly ""welcome back"". The hotel offers a complimentary car service in the evening. Use of the car is based on availability. Great service!    Check-out was prompt and correct. We stored our luggage for the day since we had a late flight out. Both security and concierge service were most friendly on our departure and provided us the departure cards that we filled out at the hotel.    Overall this hotel has an excellent and friendly staff. The resort is spacious has a wonderful garden and plenty of facilities to have a great holiday.    Did it meet up to our expectations?    If it comes to the staff: yes. However it did not meet up with our luxury standards that is usually provided at the Leading hotels of the World (LHW) SLH SPG Westin or W brand. It is all in the details but the details are the difference between a regular 5 star experience and a exceptional experience that we were expecting from Four Seasons.",Date of stay: January 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ZevenHertjes
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Au11aud wrote a review Jan 2019,40,Amazing kids club - but no atmosphere,We stayed in Oct during half term for 3 nights. The hotel was very expensive like 800 euros the night approx.  I was shocked at the breakfast buffet put in a side room and so small. I was very disappointed.    Unfortunately we could not use the pool as it was raining for 3 days.    Our son loved the kids club so this was amazing.    The food in the restaurant was not up so much. For the price they could do better.    The evening entertainment was very poor no bar where everyone can come to listen to a band or a singer. There was just 1 person playing quietly in a corner some maracas that one one would care. Very boring.    The bedroom was great but I would not go to the pavilion again as too far to walk especiallly when it’s raining.    For the 3rd of the price you can go to Sofitel Marrakech in the center with better rooms nice pools of course the kids club is something at Sofitel and no one can beat this. But everything else better elsewhere in Marrakech.

There is a kettle in each room so you can make your own drinks and sit on the large balcony.I loved sitting and relaxing on our balcony at the end of the day or early morning with a cup of tea!! Breakfast was included in the price when we booked our holiday. The buffet was delicious and high quality and I would definitely recommend that as part of the holiday they have a pancake station my daughter had fresh pancakes every day which she loved.I asked one of the chefs if I could have Khlea tagine with eggs it was cooked to order and absolutely delicious On several other occasions I requested mesemen pancakes with honey they were also freshly cooked and the best I have tasted.We ate in the restaurants a couple of times and also ate out at various restaurants/cafes in Marrakech so it was a nice mix. Swimming pool was fabulous there are two to chose from. The hotel was furnished to a high standard it was light airy and relaxing but what made the hotel were the wonderful staff who were so warm helpful professional and friendly without being formal.

It was quiet private large and very comfortable. Also CLEAN. One of the most important factors to me and there wasn't one day that I felt the place needed another run-through.    Food: My first meal in Morocco was here! Perhaps not the most local setting...but it was very very good. I also had breakfast twice and couldn't help feeling satisfied with the food and beautiful view. The alcoholic drinks were understandably diluted so there was some want for a little more kick but what can you do?    Pool: You gotta check out the pool.    Resort: I felt completely removed from the hustle and bustle of the city which is what I was looking for on this trip. It was quiet and relaxing. I did do many trips into the city and the surrounding nature (e.g. Atlas Mountains) but being able to come back to a place like this brought peace of mind.    Service: Top quality friendly and helpful. It was a little strange to me that the front desk agents also doubled as concierges. Still I got the information I needed without hassle.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Roman K wrote a review Jan 2019,50,Amazing Service!,We came with high expectations and the Four Seasons Marrakech delivered in all areas. My highest marks go to the overall service level reliability consistency and competence of the team. Everyone we encountered during our 8-night stay performed to the highest level one would expect and they did so with confidence efficiency and with a smile. The property itself is gorgeous with 3 different pools one for adults only and the other 2 for families. Needless to say there is a gorgeous spa area with all services one could ask for a beautiful gym steam room etc. The three restaurants are excellent and serve a variety of different cuisines. Considering we were there for 8 nights I would perhaps have liked a bit more variety at breakfast with perhaps a couple of rotating dishes. Our room was perhaps not quite at the same level as some of the other Four Seasons I've been to but the overall service more than made up for that and essentially we spent little time in the room. The bed is amazingly comfortable the bathroom is huge and well-lit the shower is perhaps a bit basic and it would have been great to have a desk vs. a small dining table but that's a matter of preference. We did enjoy the large and sunny balcony with sitting area. Overall we had a fantastic stay and plan to return in the not too distant future. I want to take this opportunity to thank the entire team for their amazing service and hospitality.,Date of stay: December 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,Hong Kong,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelTastic4Ever
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,ConstantStar2016 wrote a review Jan 2019,50,Wonderful time at Four Seasons Marrakech.,From the moment you arrive at the Four Seasons Marrakech you know you're in for a special experience. The entrance to the property has a double gate that once you're past leads to a special entry with pools and a wonderful atrium. Our family was there during Christmas week and beautiful decorations were at the entrance and in the main foyer - adding a festive note. All staff members at the resort are warm and genuinely friendly. Everyone from the Bell Staff restaurant waiters & managers maid service are intent on making your stay a wonderful experience. Each interaction with the concierge staff was outstanding - these folks know how to arrange things big and small . Service at the pool was great too with setup for food & drinks always well presented. After a long day touring the Atlas Mountains which we recommend we ordered room service as we were too tired to go out - well it was wonderful - they come in set things up and then take it all away so your room is clean. The resort itself is very pretty and well maintained - we loved the fountain area just outside the main restaurant Quattro - where you can have breakfast. The upstairs restaurant is a wonderful place to have a light meal drinks or dinner - we loved eating outside. The room was tastefully decorated had a wonderful outdoor patio with a view of the mountains and the resort. We loved our stay and are now fans of the Four Seasons. We highly recommend the Four Seasons Marrakech - we have wonderful memories of the city the nearby country-side - all enhanced by our stay at this resort.,Date of stay: December 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Silver Spring, Maryland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ConstantStar2016

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,2hotinMiami wrote a review Jan 2019,50,Superb staff eager to please!,We stayed at the Four Seasons Marrakech for 5 days over the Christmas holidays. Every member of the staff I encountered during our stay was polite attentive and eager to please. The manager was present nearly every day making himself available and greeted guests during breakfast. We were greeted by name by many of the hotel staff as we encountered them throughout our stay. I found this to be quite impressive considering the size of resort. We stayed in an upper-level suite overlooking the pool with a large balcony with two lounge chairs and a reading nook. We had an adjoining room for our family which had two terraces. The rooms were well appointed the beds were very comfortable. We found an adapter plug in our night table which was a nice added touch as one can never have enough adapters! The toiletries were Atelier Cologne which were lovely. I enjoyed the Nespresso machine in my room which reminded me of home. We enjoyed the spa pools fitness room young adult center and Quattro the Italian restaurant all of which were enjoyable. I found the daily buffet breakfast to be generous and plentiful with a hot chocolate bar daily smoothies as well as items which could be ordered off the menu. The concierge desk arranged many things for us both in advance of our stay and during our stay. The staff expertly packed and boxed our oddly shaped purchases to make it easier of us to bring home. I found the grounds and main areas very clean and well maintained. I found the location to be very good not too far from the main sights we visited. Overall an excellent stay & I'd highly recommended the Four Seasons Hotel.,Date of stay: December 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Miami, Florida",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2hotinMiami

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,cob808 wrote a review Dec 2018,30,Not Four Seasons quality,"We stayed with our family for three nights (two suites with private pools).    The grounds were above average and on par with a typical Four Seasons resort. Pools were nice (seemed new) and the fitness center / tennis courts were as expected (Four Seasons quality). Spas were also excellent quality. Would have been nice to have outdoor hot tubs that weren't split by gender but it was fine.    The rooms were spartan and a little stale. Now bear in mind I'm comparing these to other Four Seasons. We expected more luxury for the price tag but these were equivalent to an above average hotel in the U.S. I would expect to pay $200 - 300 / night for these rooms but we were easily paying triple (or more).    The service is hit or miss but this was consistent with our entire Morocco trip. There is certainly no rush or hurry when you're being served. You really have to go out of your way to get someone's attention (again consistent throughout our trip). The staff on average was friendly.    The food was decent at best. For a Four Seasons we were expecting to be ""wowed"" but every meal was bland small portions and expensive. Not a single meal had us wanting to go back and we ate at every restaurant. Just weird cuisine. We tried different types of food at each. The Moroccan Italian American food just wasn't very good. Portions were small and all meals were expensive. We were really eating at the hotel out of convenience when we didn't want to venture out. Our meals outside the hotel were all significantly better and a fraction of the price. I would say meals get better as the day went on. Breakfast is plain bad. Lunch is OK. Dinner is decent.    Back to the rooms. We stayed in one bedroom villas with private pools (on the ground floor obviously). These villas are two levels so if you're on the ground floor I was shocked by the footfall noise you hear above you. There's zero soundproofing. When someone walks you hear it LOUD. One morning housekeeping began cleaning the room above us at 8:30am. It was like a rock band playing above you. Good luck sleeping.    Back to the service. Compared to most of the people we interacted with throughout our trip the staff at the Four Seasons was more professional. When you go to Morocco be prepared to be on guard your entire trip. The moment you step foot in Marrakech you're a target. Mostly everyone is out to rip you off. We didn't get that sense at the Four Seasons (thankfully) but there were a couple times when we were very annoyed. We bought expensive rugs in the market that we checked in at bag drop. When we were loading our car to the airport the rugs were missing. The staff apologized after we caught the mistake but it seemed very convenient that this was the one missing bag. The transport doors were closed so if we didn't double check who knows what would have happened? This epitomized our trip to Marrakech. From taxi drivers to airport handlers everyone has their hand out. You really have to be ready to argue / negotiate constantly. We pre-negotiated every transport ride and haggled everywhere we went. It's just the way of life there but it's off-putting for sure.    Overall the hotel was OK but not Four Seasons standard. The food coupled with the room noise left much to be desired. I've stayed at probably 30+ Four Seasons properties and this was in the bottom 10%. Just not worth the price point.",Date of stay: December 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cob808

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,andrew b wrote a review Dec 2018,30,Should you stay or should you not?,Marrakech is a city with many luxurious hotels so it becomes a difficult choice in deciding which one is going to be for you. My recent stay at the four seasons Marrakech introduced me to an outstandingly beautiful property well-maintained and with well finished rooms.    The staff overall are extremely attentive friendly and soon recognize who you are.    The big negative is a poor front desk and concierge service. Your first impressions of the hotel are often centred around how you are greeted and the check in process.unfortunately the front desk of the Marrakech four seasons fails to live up to the standard of this iconic chain.  Even though I had pre checked in with the 4 seasons app the process was repeated.  The guest relations manager (Janine) was angry that she had to deal with my requests and in no uncertain terms let me know about this throughout the stay in the hotel. Although I had asked them to book restaurants and tours they could hardly find it and never produced any hard copies of The reservations.    Touring the other iconic hotels of Marrakech leads me to believe that location is also important and that the four seasons is situated a little out-of-the-way which is not a problem if you are chauffeur driven or are taking taxis.    Overall the dilemma of having to stay here again is unfortunately in my case going to be decided upon the poor treatment the front desk hands out.,Date of stay: December 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O8517FFandrewb

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Michealangelo wrote a review Nov 2018,30,Good hotel but expected better from Four Seasons,It really is a lovely hotel. The lobby grounds and rooms are all great. The pools are also great to relax and enjoy some downtime.    The service is what was a bit of a miss for us. It could have been we had high expectations from a Four Seasons or we just stayed at a wonderful Riad in the old city where service was impeccable.    A few examples of this being - went to concierge to ask for dinner recommendations and they just handed us a list of 20+ recommended places for us to read through (that’s what I’d expect from a Best Western in Topeka) to when ordering a taxi to dinner they didn’t tell the driver where we were going and the. having to try and explain to the driver who spoke no English (when they could have done it in seconds).    The room was lovely but little things like not giving us new shampoo and soap when we were almost out to taking our water glasses and not leaving new ones are the little things I’d expect the Four Seasons to be completely ahead of.    The other drawback for us as a couple with no kids was there were quite a few young kids staying here and running around the lobby etc. Which when one of the restaurants and bar is in the beautiful lobby it was a bit distracting to hear kids running around being rather loud.    I know I’m being rather critical as it really is a beautiful hotel but the lower rating is based on my expectations of the Four Seasons brand along with the price point for the hotel.    I’d recommend staying at a local Riad (many which are rated highly on TripAdvisor) instead.,Date of stay: November 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Michealangelo

As requested we had a top floor room with view in a quiet location. Room was upscale roomy and designed for comfort with balcony large bathroom and coffee table with chairs. This hotel is not your Moroccan Riad but rather a top of the line western design with Moroccan themes.    Hotel is located outside of the main city tourist spots and if you walk its not particularly pleasant. So take taxis at maximum 100 dirhams depending on where you want to go. One morning we wanted to walk to the nearby Carrefour (20 mins) and hotel security suggested a golf cart ride to their staff entrance then walk. It was still a ten minute walk using your navigation skills. We walked back to staff entrance and they called the cart to pick us up. We appreciated their effort.    We ate dinner twice in their Quattro restaurant. Both times the food was great and service fantastic. Their breakfast buffet was the best we experienced in all our tour hotels around Morocco.    Weather was a bit cool during our stay with some rain (snow in mountains) so we did not experience the hotel pools and grounds. The view of the grounds from our room balcony was stunning.

The hotel location is not great and you have to take taxis everywhere even if you want to go for a walk! The reception is nice and room well designed. However the vibe in the hotel was not so good. The clientele was generally elder couples and it lacked the vibe found elsewhere in Marrakech. The restaurant choices are limited and food was not to a good standard. It’s a shame  as most 5 star hotels allow you to eat in but still get good food. Positives are great pool and nice gardens. Gym was well equipped. However would not rush back and would not be in a hurry to stay in this chain again!  We had previously stayed at the Sofitel Marrakech a few times and we would rate that hotel head and shoulders over this one.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Adam S wrote a review Nov 2018,20,Concierge poor,I am due to travel to the hotel tomorrow. Yesterday morning I sent some questions and requests to book activities to the concierge. Tonight despite a follow up email and two telephone calls I have still not had a response from the concierge. This is not what I expected from the Four Seasons and it does not bode well for my trip. I wanted to organise some excursions before my arrival but they have not responded.

All hotel staff available to help us through an extremely stressful experience...including how to use the phone to contact family members in USA.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Ascroftie wrote a review Nov 2018,50,Excellent Chill Out in Marrakesh,Four Seasons provided an excellent retreat from the exciting madness and business of the Medina. We enjoyed staying in the hotel and dipping into the Medina as and when we pleased - taxis to the Medina were 50MAD one way so fairly reasonable. The hotel feels spacious - the gardens are beautiful and our room was one of the most spacious rooms we've stayed in. Hotel staff were always very proactive to help with nothing being too much bother. Senior hotel staff were very visible throughout the hotel chatting with guests.  Only slight downsides being the lack of light snacks being available and whilst it is fine to walk from the hotel there was no where really to walk to and it was alongside a major busy road.  But we would love to return it was a great experience and I would not hesitate to recommend.,Date of stay: November 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Belfast, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ascroftie

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Mrveldon wrote a review Oct 2018,40,Beautiful resort,We stayed at the Four Seasons in October and had a wonderful stay.    Service is excellent and we were upgraded to a King Suite on arrival. The rooms and facilities are as you would expect from the Four Seasons and are all high quality.    There a range of pools if you have a family or want some quiet time. You also have a Kids club and Young Adult centre to keep children occupied.    The spa and treatments are excellent although note the spa is split into two sections male and female so it’s not possible for couples to use the same facilities together.    The gym is excellent and has a cardio and weights area along with tennis courts.    The restaurants are ‘ok’. Breakfast can get very busy and cramped (particularly when children are there) which is a bit disappointing given the size of the resort. Our main gripe was the quality and variety of food available - it’s fine but we just expected more from the Four Seasons.    That aside we highly recommend the hotel and would go back.,Date of stay: October 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mrveldon

F&B was fantastic- very fresh light and inventive cuisine that one associates with Four Seasons. Some dramatic design moves in the public spaces- very clean sophisticated design and the landscaping contributing to create a relaxed and serene atmosphere.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,TEU793 wrote a review Oct 2018,30,Very friendly staff - terrible location - massive airplane noise,Our family visit here started bad since the night before arrival the Four Seasons Marrakesh - finally after weeks responded to our emails for airport transfer restaurant reservations etc. and informed us that our reservation was non existing or cancelled. Only next morning after a sleepless night they informed us that this was an error and on arrival we received a bottle of cheap Prosecco.  We are normally big Four Seasons fans and this was our 4th stay in a FS in 2018 but the fact that even very loyal customers are treated as first timers in every resort and those hiccups make us think twice. Even they recognized my wife’s birthday at check in there was not even a card etc.  The resort in Marrakesh is at a terrible location very close to the airport and you hear the planes from early in the morning till evening. The resort overall is ok but lacking some warmth and color.  The service and food is great and the staff very friendly - esp Ismail at breakfast was amazing.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Ruth B wrote a review Oct 2018,40,Wonderful few days,Had a fabulous time here used almost all of the facilities and found much to like. Ate in Inaro and Quattro and the food was very tasty and the staff fun chatty and relaxed but efficient. Tried the shisha one night in Inaro and that was great too. Breakfasts were excellent with many high quality choices.  Played tennis on the clay court excellent.  Had several spa treatments which were professional and of a high standard if pricey.  Our room was very well attended extremely clean and the staff did a fantastic job of keeping us in order. Our teenaged daughter was sharing our room on a rollaway bed so this did put a strain on housekeeping but they were 100% brilliant and it was a joy to come back to our room after a day out and about.  Some slight down points -  I had emailed concierge in advance with some requests restaurant reservations etc and these were confirmed only when we arrived we found they hadn't been made. This was disappointing but remedied by mixing things up a bit.  Getting the courtesy car taxi or hotel car from the front of the hotel into the city in the evening is frenetic and tiresome with so many movements. A taxi should cost about 500 dirham.  After a mishap the hotel sweetly arranged to collect us from a golf club but then their car didn't come for 90 minutes! This is very typical of so many many things that happened. Everyone apologises eagerly and they make up for things with kindness and gifts - but these things shouldn't happen in the first place.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Babyfacemama wrote a review Oct 2018,30,Not what I expected from the Four seasons.,We stayed here in October. It was quite pleasant but the room was not clean. The bathroom still had obvious signs of the previous occupants which made my skin crawl. I reported some of the dirt to the turn down staff and received an immediate apology and some comp bits the next day. The offending dirty items were removed and replaced. There were a few other dirty bits in the bathroom which I didn't mention as it was the first day and I was tired. I thought as I had complained the whole area would be deep cleaned but that was not the case. Only the dirt I pointed to was cleaned. The rest was left untouched. I had to go through each bit and point to it and then it was cleaned. The staff were polite and attentive when I complained but its not really how I want to spend my holiday. Otherwise the food wasn't bad by hotel food standards. The pool was lovely. The staff in the restaurants were keen to please and polite especially the lady who runs the breakfast and pizza restaurant. She was super efficient and just the right amount of friendly which is a difficult balance to master. If I were to stay in Marrakech again I would probably give the place another go but would email ahead to ask that the room receive a deep clean. I watched a documentary on the hotel industry which said cleaning staff don't get enough time to clean. Maybe its something all hotels should consider looking at.  Otherwise the hotel is a great oasis and retreat from the chaos of Marrakech. It's minutes from jma el fna and the cost to get to the centre is €5. It offers all the usually 5* services.,Date of stay: October 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Babyfacemama

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Shaukat wrote a review Oct 2018,30,Lunch in the lobby restaurant was really disappointing,The worst meal experience over a six night stay in Marrakech was at the Four Seasons. We went there for lunch before leaving for the airport. The simple order of a few club sandwiches and salads took over an hour and half to arrive and even then they got the order wrong. When we complained we were always told the food was on its way. The offer of a 50% reduction on the bill was appreciated but not nearly enough to make up for the rush to finish lunch and rush to the airport.

Upon check-in there was a problem with my card that was resolved in a professional manner.    I was there as part of my birthday celebration and they provided me with champagne and dessert as a token. I ordered room service several times and was thoroughly satisfied with my meals (dinner and breakfast). One of the gentlemen that had removed my room service items from my room saw me walking from the lobby area after shopping in the Medina. He quickly offered to drive me back to my room because of the bags in my hands. Very thoughtful indeed.    If I return to Marrakech I will definitely place this property on a list of places to possibly stay.    A highlight of the trip was hearing the call to prayer several times per day.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,WeWanderlustCo wrote a review Sep 2018,50,Hip hotel with Moroccan vibes,Four Seasons Marrakech is a vast property which sits close to the airport. It has lots to offer for couples families and business executives. What drew us to the Four Seasons was the Instagram famous fountain pool and we were not disappointed. Although it would've been great if the weather was less gloomy.  It has two pools one for family/kids and one for adults. Magnificent gardens which are well maintained a spa which also has the traditional hammam and a tea garden for both men and women. If staying fit is your focus they offer a gym as well as a tennis court.  They have three great restaurants to choose from. The main one is Inara that is located in the lobby and provides classic Moroccan and International dishes and afternoon tea and cocktails throughout the day. We had our last dinner here in the patio overlooking the beautiful fountain pool and the sweet staff made it more memorable by going above and beyond.  Our favorite restaurant was Quattro where the ambiance was laid back and romantic. With its dim-lit charm Quattro offers fine Italian dining.  We had lunch once at Azzera which is their poolside restaurant and they serve lunch from 12pm to 5pm. They also have the cutest ice-cream bar where you can get ice-cream until 5pm. The deserts are to die for and our favourites were the Creme brulee and tiramisu.

Although it is only located about five minutes by taxi from the medina it is the ideal silent oasis to relax in when not out exploring. From the moment we arrived we were treated with the usual Four Seasons excellence by all of the attentive but not intrusive staff.    Our suite was wonderfully appointed with ample room for a family of four and the private plunge pool was ideal for cooling off later at night. The spa and fitness facilities were perfectly equipped and the treatments we booked were very good.    Breakfast served outside overlooking the peaceful garden and fountains was a sumptuous buffet with great variety – the main chef whose name we unfortunately didn’t get but who made excellent omelettes introduced us to some delicious local delicacies including Msemen - shukran.    On the nights we didn’t venture in to the Medina or Gueliz for dinner we enjoyed fantastic food and service at Quattro and Inara – a special thanks to Youssef at Inara for all his hospitality.    Although all of the staff were excellent an extra thank you to Abderahim and Soufiane both of whom were stationed at the front arrival/valet area and Belhassan at the door (apologies for any spelling mistakes) who all expertly co-ordinated our travels as we left to explore and greeted us warmly like family returning home.

Very limited Restaurant options and no outside evening bar which is a shame as they have the space and physical facility to operate one.

Pros  Breakfast has choices amazing coffee and freshly squeezed orange juice and the pancakes made to your specification  Rooms are cleaned thoroughly and there is a turn down service in the evening  Good exchange rate  Aircon is not noisy in the rooms  Balcony’s are large  Security coming in to the hotel is great 2 gates and someone with a bomb alert device going over all cars coming in to the hotel  Standard WiFi was very fast for a hotel with good signal  Men can wear shorts to the restaurants  Beautiful pools  Wonderful staff throughout the hotel always striving to meet your needs  Pool bar and room service offered the best meals at the hotel in my opinion  Complimentary cold bottles of water and cold desserts brought daily to sunbathers  The spa treatment my partner and I had was extremely professional and relaxing I would recommend using the hot jacuzzi before or after  The hotel is close to the airport    Thank you for looking after us 4S and making our holiday a wonderful one.,Date of stay: September 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kacylee
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,juliafyra wrote a review Sep 2018,40,Absolutely amazing resort located a bit outside of the Medina,LOCATION: The resort is located very closely to the airport (max. 10 minutes by car; luckily there’s no aircraft noise). It takes you 15 minutes by car to the Medina (old town incl. souk) and maybe 10 minutes by car to Guéliz (modern area of Marrakesh). If you’d like to go to the Medina by foot the Four Seasons is not the best choice. We did it several times but the walk is not especially beautiful.    RESORT: Absolutely beautiful!!! I loved it from the moment we arrived there. The resort is very spacious. It doesn’t feel as if there were guests of 300 rooms. Every morning I went running through the resort – that’s when I realized how big it actually was (one round was more than 1km).    ROOMS: Very comfortable beds nice balcony very big bathroom incl. shower and tub. Our room was very spacious.    SERVICE: The staff is wonderful! All staff members (front desk breakfast dinner restaurant pool garden etc.) were absolutely amazing and very helpful. Thank you so much for making our stay so comfortable and relaxing. We enjoyed our four days with you very much!    BREAKFAST: Excellent! There was everything you could possibly wish for from müesli lots of fresh fruit nuts nut butter bread croissants patisserie egg dishes freshly pressed juice smoothies etc. Every morning when I woke up I was looking forward to the breakfast (good thing we always did a 1 to 2 hour work out first …)    VALUE FOR MONEY: I was invited so I can’t judge it this time :-),Date of stay: July 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Zurich, Switzerland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juliafyra
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Trustedtraveller2014 wrote a review Sep 2018,20,Poor service standards,"Emailed hotel prior to arrival requesting connecting rooms and this was confirmed before arrival. After long drive from the coast was underwhelmed by the arrival with family having to stand around behind me at the desk with no chairs or welcome drink and kids ignored. Check in experience was a disaster with reception insisting they hadn't got any instructions for connecting rooms. We were then led to a waiting room and promised the rooms for 4pm. Come 4pm no one bothers to call us. After a number of calls over the next half hour someone turns up to escort us to the rooms and then tells us only one is available whilst the other is still being cleaned due to a late check out. Again we are left not knowing whats happening and told it will be ""ready in 5 minutes"" a number of times until I enter the room myself and inform reception it seems ready. I am then asked to check all the amenities are in the room which is not my job and not something I want to be doing after a 4 hour wait! We are then told the stock response to the problem ""the hotel is full"" which is not the type of response expected when at a Four Seasons. Complained to the duty manager Magdi who to be fair was very apologetic and offered us a meal as compensation but to be honest would have preferred a smooth check in experience as it totally ruined the day.  Other issues arose at breakfast where the teenage waiters did not write down our orders and tried to remember them. This resulted in mix ups and non arrival of dishes which when we told them we hadn't received they tried to convince us we hadn't ordered them! A similar issue arose at Lunch where the waiters confused the dessert order but by then we were resigned to this and just laughed with them about it. Not sure if this is laziness or poor training but not writing down orders is just not acceptable. Other irritations were late cleaning of the rooms (around 2pm) and safety boxes not working at various times.  To top of the stay I asked for a check out at 1pm but then had to enter into a long debate to negotiate to keep one room until 12.30 which was annoying when our check in wasn't until 5pm but were told "" a big group is arriving"" so the room was needed! Sure enough check out was shambolic with the bill being printed 3 times with various mistakes.  Maybe we were unlucky but something appears to be going wrong at this place.",Date of stay: August 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trustedtraveller2014
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,seavol wrote a review Sep 2018,30,"Incredible Staff & Activities, but Room Maintenance was a Let Down",My wife and I (along w/ our two little ones one being a toddler and the other a baby) stayed here for 4 nights over the summer and were really impressed by the hotel staff's friendliness and engagement with us throughout the stay. From the moment we checked in played at the pool or dined at the restaurants (we particularly loved the Italian restaurant) the staff was incredible friendly and engaged with our family. The kids club was also well put together with tons of activities snack time and was generally a great place to site and relax to beat the heat and watch our daughter engage in dance and craft building. The pools were great and the hotel was located far enough from the city center you didn't hear the noise but was also close to the airport and other locations it was easy to get around.    However the overall room quality was a let down based on other Four Seasons we have been to and similar luxury hotels. The first time we entered the room and flushed the toilet the button on the wall fall off and as we opened the curtains the rod fell and broke of. We then noticed the the baby sheets were not being changed even though it was obvious they needed to be and there were bugs all over the room. So many ants entered the room (our doors were always closed) that we noticed they were in the baby's formula powder so we had to disregard it. It also took a few phone calls to get more then 2 water bottles but every time we called the hotel immediately responded. As we were staying in the garden bungalow they mentioned bugs do happen but after staying at luxury hotels in the jungle i've never had this happen especially at a luxury resort.    We would stay here again as it is a great family option with 3 kids clubs but the room maintenance could be improved especially based on the number of issues we had when compared to staying at other luxury hotels.,Date of stay: June 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Portland, Oregon",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seavol
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,RachaelHampshire_UK wrote a review Sep 2018,50,The most amazing hotel!!!,Visited here for 4 days with my boyfriend and completely loved it! The hotel had a luxurious and spacious and airy feel and the rooms were huge with beautiful balcony’s and views. The pools were stunning and so well maintained with so much land - they are as amazing as they look in the pictures  Don’t go expecting the modern and contemporary designs of the Four seasons in LA/NY/London the hotel has a more morrocan traditional feel and fits in so well with the city!  The service was superb both by the pool in the restaurants and the reception and greeting guys. They can’t do enough to help! The small touches by the pool made it extra special - free water sun cream ice creams handed out. And the bottle of wine and macaroons left for us on our last night was so thoughtful.  The fitness centre was enormous and was really utilised by most of the guests  It’s also only 10 mins drive from the airport and the central square and old town. I stayed in a Riad last time but way preferred to be a little further out of town at the FS this time.    The only small downsides ...  The alcohol is pretty extortionate (I appreciate it’s an Arabic country) but charging £15 for a glass of prosecco and £20 a cocktail is a little extreme!  If you say to taxi drivers you are coming back to the four seasons they automatically double the cost of the taxi ride home - be forceful and say you will only pay 50 dirums (standard charge) otherwise walk away and find another taxi    I really recommend this hotel - we will definitely be returning!

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,jakeperryamex wrote a review Aug 2018,50,As good as it gets,We had just spent 3 days/2 nights on a desert excursion so we knew we wanted to follow that up with some R & R. We decided on the Four Seasons over La Mamounia because we knew what we would get. Happy to report they did not disappoint. From the moment we arrived all the staff was so friendly. We had a premier garden room on the 2nd floor looking over the main fountains it was perfect. It also had a great outside alcove couch which was awesome to lay down in the afternoon. We spent a good amount of time at the beautiful pool which is adult only. They have a separate kids pool. Our man Mohammed took great care of us with food and drinks and we were totally able to relax. We only ate at one of the restaurants which was the poolside restaurant. The food was fine and if I have a critique about the hotel I would say the service there wasn’t very attentive. We did stop over at the La Mamounia and it was gorgeous. If we came back to Kech again we might try staying there since it’s inside the Medina. Overall if you are looking for a great stay the Four Seasons won’t disappoint.,Date of stay: August 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jakeperryamex
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Rupi_07 wrote a review Aug 2018,20,Poor Service and a let down to the Four Seasons Group,Having stayed in 5 or 6 Four Seasons around the world I felt compelled to write a review on this resort. I found the service shocking should you wish to request anything by the pool be prepared to ask 3/4 times before they action your request when they do it's like they are doing you a favour. I rang the hotel reception requesting something and four times I had to call them back 3 times the request was not actioned. This location does a dis service to the Four Seasons Group the staff are not interested in guest’s welfare or experience. Ordering a taxi is another issue no queuing system staff change over so they don't know who is waiting it’s a mess.  I can honestly say the only good customer service I experience was from Jaharn (Guest Services Manager) other than that sorry zero service. Considering you have such a selection of hotels in the area I am surprised that the staff are not up to par. If you want a luxurious resort and excellent customer service I would avoid this hotel. They don't have a patch on the Dubai For Seasons now that really is world class.,Date of stay: August 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rupi_07

We’ve had a great service throughout the entire stay we were helped both via the Four Seasons chat and classical service.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,TravelBee50 wrote a review Aug 2018,50,Beautiful Four Seasons,Beautiful hotel and grounds located within 10 minutes of the airport and 10 minutes of the Medina. You can pre-book the hotel to pick you up at the airport in a luxury vehicle for 400MAD one way or 600MAD return. There are plenty of taxis but you have to negotiate with them before you get in their taxi. It should be a 100MAD taxi ride to the hotel from the airport. However after a long fight and first time to Marrakech I wasn’t up for taxi negotiations. Next time maybe. The hotel has a Moroccan flair with a Four Seasons feel. My room was spacious and well appointed and had a lovely patio that over looked the pool. They have 2 pools - an adult pool and a family pool. The restaurant for breakfast offered a nice buffet or you can order off the menu. The breakfast service was good although it depended on your server - some were much more service oriented than others. They have poolside lunch service which was very good too. The front desk personnel were helpful. Communication via email with the hotel was easy and effective. If you want to walk out of the hotel and explore the Medina choose a hotel in the Medina. The Four Seasons is outside of the Medina although a lovely hotel. It’s a 50MAD taxi ride each way to/from the Medina. Very satisfied and happy with my stay at the Four Seasons Marrakech.,Date of stay: August 2018,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelBee50

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,424nme wrote a review Aug 2018,50,Anniversary holiday,We stayed 4 days at the hotel. Beautiful ground floor room with plunge pool. The staff were very attentive ( but not annoyingly so) and curtious and would always spare a few minutes to ask how our stay was going. In particular the staff on reception and at the entrance were very helpful and friendly always on hand to make suggestions re where to go and give advice when needed. The staff around the pool couldn’t have been more helpful- they even cleaned my sunglasses for me! We went on a half day tour of the city with Mohammed Berdai a fantastic guide suggested by the hotel - he was so knowledgable about the monuments we visited and was fun to spend time with. It was really really hot so I appreciated the fact that he kept checking if we were ok to keep walking.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Beverley P wrote a review Aug 2018,50,ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC,I stayed at the Four Seasons for 5 days with my daughter and granddaughter and found the hotel absolutely divine. Could not fault this hotel at all. Our room was spacious clean and well maintained. The pool area was lovely baskets of cold bottled water was handed out at no extra cost together with ice lollies. The hotel is located in a quiet spot with taxis at hand. You could get to just about anywhere it seems for the same price 50 Dirhams but beware the taxi prices double at night. This has no reflection on the hotel whatsoever. The only grey area I'd say that could do with a bit of improvement is that 2 chefs are needed each at the omelette & crepes stations to avoid queues at breakfast. Other than that I have no qualms recommending this hotel. The staff and concierge were delightful and went out of their way to oblige.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,vicrob1980 wrote a review Aug 2018,50,Outstanding holiday,I would like to start by saying this hotel is probably the best family hotel we have ever stayed in it has thought of everything from baby’s right up to early teens. We have 12 yr old son who didn’t complain once in the two weeks we were there so for me that is testament to this hotel. I can’t write this review without mentioning the staff they are simply outstanding from the doorman with the biggest smile to the maid that looked after our room every single member of staff you come across is both helpful and friendly nothing is too much trouble. I would like to say a big thank you to all who made our stay so memorable especially Sophia and ever member of her team in the  Inara restaurant the food and service we received was exceptional we love Moroccan food and although we did go out of the hotel to eat in the la soltana and the la Maison Arabe which were very good the food and service in the Inara was by far the best. If you are looking for a family holiday in Marrakech and don’t want to compromise on your luxury then I can not recommend this hotel enough. I should however say If you don’t have children this is definitely still a fantastic place to go the kids pool is completely separate for the adult in fact you would hardly know it catered so well for children they have kept it all very separate so it works for everyone I don’t want to put anyone off going that is looking for a relaxing couples holiday because you will certainly get that at the four season Marrakech.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Max25 wrote a review Aug 2018,40,"Wonderful resort, fabulous service, disappointing decor.",The website sells this hotel particularly well and reality doesn't disappoint - it's on a grand scale it's lush and tropical the outdoor spaces are wonderful enormous palm-lined courtyards and the pools and pool service are up there with the best anywhere...    On top of that the service is just fantastic. The best of Four Seasons. Over our five day stay we probably had at least five incidences where the service offering exceeded our expectations by a country mile. Such a joy really.    If you're coming to hang out around the pool which we kind of were then you couldn't be in a better place in the world almost. A proper size adult and kids pool so the adult pool was perfectly relaxing all day with the most attentive pool-side service you could want a lovely pool-side restaurant close by and a setting where you can comfortably spend a good portion of the day.    The thing that disappointed us was the quality of the interior environment - primarily the soft furnishings and fixtures and fittings. It's just not up to Four Seasons standards. We travelled from here to Four Seasons Casablanca and that hotel is perfectly on point which just reiterated how off the mark they are here. It feels like the budget ran out after the landscaping and before they could finish furnishing the hotel so they had to settle for a cheaper decorator and lower quality furniture and soft furnishings. A pity because otherwise it's just a great place to come and enjoy Marrakech.    Close enough to the medina to be a quick 10min cab ride but also far enough away to be a peaceful oasis to come back to after the craziness.    If we went back we'd be tempted to try the Mamounia or Royal Mansour - but they're substantially more expensive with less spacious gardens/pool areas. So this really does have it all just not quite the Four Seasons we've come to know expect and love.,Date of stay: July 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Max25

Special mention for Ahmed (and team) in house keeping who really went above and beyond; Ismail at breakfast & Belhasan’s beautiful smile as he welcomed us back from our evenings out ... we were debating between FS and a more “authentic riad” experience. I’m so glad we chose the resort ... it’s an oasis from the hustle and bustle and the Morroccan influences certainly are not lost.    It’s location is perfect.

Perfectly situated between the city’s ancient swirling medina and the cosmopolitan neighbourhoods of the Ville Nouvelle the resort welcomes you with a blissful and luxurious retreat.    On every step in the most beautiful decorated resort traditional values and contemporary comforts unite. The splendid and most comfortable rooms with private terrace all have a view to the pool side of the hotel. You are not going to miss anything here - best comfort with high end service awaits you. A family and a adult pool invite you for a swim or just sipping a cocktail. Three restaurants will be open for your convenience offering all kind of foods - from Italian to Moroccan. Best quality and outstanding service can be awaited. Life music and wonderful entertainment (changing daily) as well as great art disposed around the resort are installed for your pleasure and enjoyment.    A wonderful spa invites you to experience true relaxation and outstanding treatments. A fitness center and two floodlit tennis courts are available to all sport enthusiasts.    For all conference planners and event agencies at the Four Seasons you can choose from five elegantly appointed multipurpose rooms. Each has its own unique décor and all are equipped with state-of-the-art audiovisual equipment. The meeting space is located on the lower level of the Resort with a separate driveway parking area and entrance for added convenience.  A own event space right on the large beautiful pond with amazing roof to terrace is the perfect venue for any event such as weddings anniversaries or product launches.

The stand out for us however was the fantastic kids club and fast become a favourite with our son who insisted on attending on multiple days during our stay. The team at the kids club were 100% amazing and went a very long way to making our sons and by extension our stay outstanding.    A fabulous property and one that we will continue to recommend when staying on Marrakesh!,Date of stay: August 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Manama, Bahrain",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/936aaronm

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Ushma P wrote a review Aug 2018,10,Family Trip,I don’t normally review hotels like the Four Seasons as service is meant to be exceptional! However I’ve stayed at many Four Season resorts and the Marrakech resort was disappointing for my family and I.  Day 1 was really good  Day 2 the restaurant service at Inara was terrible ... with children we started dinner at 7pm and still at 9pm no main course served . Asked for water and did not get any so my son went back to room and got a bottle from there and still when he returned no water served . When kept asking staff what was happening with main course no one could tell us. In the end we left and then the manager Sofia came running to us saying sorry but she thought we were having a relaxed evening and in no rush . I told her you should not assume and secondly the point is there is no mains at 9.30pm which is unacceptable  Day 3 as being doing for last two days previously setting out towels and stuff on sun beds getting the umbrellas ready then going back to room to get the kids ready for swimming and sunbathing however this day we came back to our spot and our stuff was thrown on floor and umbrellas given away. When we asked the pool attendant he told me the policy is they wait 2-3 minutes then they give away your spot ... I said but last two days your the one who set up things and not mentioned this before he said well this is policy   Then lunch at Azzara pizza comes we ask for plates all waiters are walking around but still no plates in the end I got up and found where the plates were and got them myself ...  Day 6 time to leave called reception twice to come get our bags and still no one came in the end we took our own bags down    Worst stay in my life at the Four Seasons . When we complained we were told we will do something for you ... nothing came off that comment and in fact paid my full bill for the week including Inara where it was the worst experience in my life !!    Do NOT VISIT THIS RESORT IF YOUR EXPECTONG EXCEPTIONAL SERVICE !!!,Date of stay: July 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Northwood, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/813ushmap

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,R E wrote a review Jul 2018,30,Great hotel with a horrible kids club experience,I ll start my review with the positive things about the Four Seasons Marrakech.  Our room was big clean with fresh flowers super nice and comfortable.  The breakfast was good with super nice and friendly service.  The two pools for families and adults are good as well.  Now the bad part for us was the kids club. The people who are working there looks and act very unprofessional. My son got kick on his head (I know kids fight sometimes but adults are the to prevent this type of situations). My son was crying and totally lost when my husband went to pick him up. The person responsible for the kids first lie to my husband saying everything was ok and my child was only miss me. My son told me my husband he was kicked on his head by a boy who came with his private nanny to the kids club and finally the lady who worked for the kids club decide to tell the truth and she was laughing about the situation. This attitude make our family very upset. For us the safety of our little one is super important. I personally was very excited about the activity on the kids club but they dont seem to happen... At least when I asked my child he said we only watched a movie or played with other kids. We talked with the manager he was very friendly and send a nurse to our room and also give a goodbye gift to my son which we appreciate a lot. I truly wish the kids club gets better because is the only thing missing for a 5 stars in my opinion.  Another positive thing about our stay was the cab driver called Said Nacif. He help us a lot with all our tours. I highly recommend to request his services at the hotel.,Date of stay: July 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Frankfurt, Germany",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/120ritae

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,funnyhols wrote a review Jul 2018,50,Exceptional,"Not only is this property beautiful it is immaculate. All credit to all the smiling and hard working staff who make it a truly special place to stay. The smell of the lobby and public areas is divine and the place is filled with bowls of roses. Two beautiful pools (never any trouble finding sunbeds at any time of day). Fantastic and speedy housekeeping and a lovely big room with a gorgeous bathroom and terrace with inset alcove seating with moroccan cushions. Delicious food - expensive yes for what it is - drinks too - but if you don't like the prices there are plenty of places in town to choose from. You're paying for great service convenience and five star premises here. The spa was exceptional and we enjoyed lovely massages and a traditional hammam experience (again you'll get cheaper in town but this was all about relaxation for us).    The hotel is 8 minutes by car into the centre of town. A complimentary shuttle operates one way from the resort between 6 and 10pm every day ask at reception. If not immediately available you only have to wait a few minutes until it's back. Or the door staff will call a taxi - flat rate of 50 MAD to anywhere in town with 100 MAD to the airport. Prepare to pay the same coming back - agree the price before you get in the taxi and if any driver asks for more wave them away and find another one (there are hundreds).    A couple of tips: Prepare to get lost in the souks but try and resist taking up the plentiful offers of help to get you out - your helpful ""guide"" will want a hefty tip and it really isn't hard to find your way out to a proper street. If you love Moroccan furniture and decorations then head to the warehouse of Mustapha Blaoui just outside the souk - it's an Aladdin's Cave of wonderful stuff. Google it - it's well worth a visit if you want to buy things to take home and make your humble abode look just like a riad!",Date of stay: July 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,England,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/funnyhols

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,cisparkle wrote a review Jul 2018,30,Like staying at a Marriott,This was a return visit to the Four Seasons and we were very disappointed. We had just stayed at Palais Namaskar but due to limited availability we booked the four seasons for our last couple of nights.  The hotel is now extremely busy unlike our first visit and despite the hotel being busier the rooftop bar with views over Marrakech is no longer open and neither is the restaurant below. Both we had looked forward to going to so a real disappointment that they are now closed and only open for functions.  The service and food at the restaurant at the pool is very good but other than that everywhere else in the hotel wasn’t good enough.  The final nail in the coffin so to speak was on our departure the man doing our checkout tried to insist we had had a massage which we had not. Our astonishment wasn’t enough and he had the nerve to question us if we were sure in a very rude manner ! Not just any massage but apparently £350. Worth of massage. This was unexcepatble from a Four Seasons and I honestly do believe we would have been happier staying at the Sofitel down the road.  We have since Christmas stayed at fours seasons in Dubai and Easter in their Mauritius property so I know the difference and this hotel may be a four Seasons by name but that is where it ends.,Date of stay: July 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Jersey, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cisparkle

The room was very spacious with a large bathroom and closet. We had a private patio with a cozy nook and chaise lounges. The adult only pool was very quiet with a beautiful restaurant at the end.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,PC1982London wrote a review Jun 2018,50,A little oasis of calm in a busy city with exceptional service,I was contemplating whether or not to stay here but then I bit the bullet and booked 7 nights for my wife 4 year old boy and myself.    We got a standard garden room which was huge with more than enough space to put a roll away bed in for my son. The main bed was a super king.    Everything is immaculate and your room is cleaned 2-3 times a day. once in the morning when you go for breakfast/pool and then again to dress down the bed and change towels etc in the eve.    I never got much time by the adult pool but when I was able to sneak away for 10/15 minutes from the family pool it was gorgeous. The family pool is just as amazing and the kids will absolutely love it. There is always constant bottled water left in ice boxes for you free of charge by your sun beds. All the pool staff are amazing.    Breakfast is good to very good. They have what you would expect of real 5 star hotel breakfast buffet + you can order from their al a carte menu if you want.    My wife had a gluten allergy and the hotel set up a meeting with the F&B Director Suhail to sit down post check in and ensure her stay was stress free. I need to stress that Suhail has far exceeded our expectations. He ensured EVERY chef and restaurant manager were fully briefed before we walked into any of their restaurants. He gave us his phone number so that my wife was able to whatsapp him anywhere in the resort in case she needed him which he was EVERY time! IF you have a food allergy and are worried about being looked after you need not worry one bit. Thank you so much for everything you and your team did. We truly appreciate and commend your highest level of professionalism.    The front desk will ensure anything you need/want is arranged. They do not know the word no. Thank you to Ghihan (not sure if I spelt that right) but she was amazing. She even arranged for me to go to a local Hamman to experience how its done by the locals (at my request). She arranged for a driver to take me explain what I wanted wait for me and bring me back. This is just to give you an idea of their service.    Food at all their restaurants were really nice especially the one by the pool and the italian. Children under 5 eat free which was amazing and something we didnt even know before going there!    Thank you again for continuing to make our experience with the four seasons group exceptional. Looking forward to staying with the group for our 4th time in the near future.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Mia E wrote a review Jun 2018,50,Don’t listen to the other people,I’m still staying here with my mum and my brother. When we arrived we were blown away by the service the places offered. We walked in the front door and had mint tea (Moroccan special) waiting for the three of us.  Before arriving I had read loads of negative comments about the place and Marrakech. When I arrived I quickly found out that they were all wrong.    The Four Seasons Hotel Marrakech is a MUST to stay in as the service could not be better and they are always there to help you. I was a bit nervous arriving of the souk and the Médina (apparently it was hectic). The hotel made sure we knew where we were going at all times and made sure we felt safe around those areas. The people here all speak English and all get you what you want when you want it. (Even as far as washing your sun glasses while at the pool)    The Médina is not hectic and not as scary as reviews make it out to be. I’m only a teenager and please trust me when I tell you that it is not crazy it is actually a really fun shopping experience for kids up to adults.    The main message I want to get across is pleaseee don’t read the comments under “terrible” or any others because they are wrong.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,setdoc7 wrote a review Jun 2018,50,Four reasons for 4 Seasons,Just got back from Marrakech and the Four Seasons. Pick up at airport in hotel black Mercedes 300 well worth it as taxis in Marrakech can be tricky. 10 minutes to hotel. Big security at hotel I guess important. Check in seamless although room was not ready for 10 minutes a short wait in the lobby. We had a patio suite with a private pool. Room is very large with excellent fixtures mini bar coffee maker (Nespresso) and beautiful patio. Bedroom is very comfy with additional doors to patio. Grounds are sprawling groomed and easy to walk. Restaurant in main house serves both Moroccan and continental dishes. We had dinner there the first night after drinks in the Medina. Food was excellent and plentiful. Service was slow by NYC standards but that is often the case in other parts of the world.  Spa is beautiful with a large locker room excellent jacuzzi cold plunge and sauna. Showers clean and well stocked.  Front desk full of good recommendations and was able to arrange tour of the Atlas Mountains three valleys and Casbah Tamadot with a private guide.  They also arranged a private guide for the Medina which was a must as it is full of twists and turns and one can easily get lost and miss the fun areas.  The lunch at the pool before leaving was yummy.  Check out also seamless and the ride to the airport was again comfortable.    I found the entire staff friendly and helpful. There are many choices in Marrakech. If you are looking for a luxury resort with all of the amenities of a western hotel the Four Seasons will suit your needs. It's proximity to the Medina without being in the constant hustle and bustle will provide the relaxation one looks for on vacation.,Date of stay: June 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"New York City, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/setdoc7

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,TDT wrote a review Jun 2018,40,Very relaxing,It has to be said that our stay didn't start particularly well. On arrival rather than being met with a welcome drink and hot/cold towel we were instead met by a large check in queue and no one to assist with luggage. We were told that the main restaurant was closed for Ramadan and on top of that the weather was freakishly cold for Marrakech. Despite this however the front office manager was extremely helpful and managed to turn around our initial impressions. The room was large (we had a pool view terrace suite which was more than large enough for 2 adults and 2 kids) and the design of the hotel was great - a mix of modern but with Moroccan hints.

The warm attentive kind and enthusiastic staff were discretely there when needed and very helpful. As first time visitors to the country we appreciated the attentive security and safety of the grounds. However our hésitations quickly melted away as we ventured into the city and nearby mountains. The guides were arranged by the hotel and were quite knowledgeable and reflective of the gentle spirit of those who live in this gracious country.

My birthday occurred during our stay and the hotel provided a cake champagne and flowers in my room - along with decorating the room with roses and balloons!! Our hotel room - Pool View Terrace Suite -- was amazing with a fold out couch in a separate area from the bedroom. We had two spacious bathrooms in our room too. Our room faced the family pool. The breakfast served daily was off-the-charts AMAZING! And the staff catered to everything that we needed. We loved our days relaxing by the pool and under the umbrellas.

This year I discussed several options with her but she definitely wanted to return to the FS in Marrakech. And again it was such a treat. All the staff outdid themselves in making her (and me) feel so welcome. Family pool and kids' club are such great places to be for the young ones! Both of us felt spoilt and pampered all the time. We got a great suite with lovely outdoor space. The hotel is still improving itself for example there was now a fresh juice bar at the breakfast buffet.

I had a suite with an additional attached room for another family member. We had big wrapping terraces overlooking beautiful view. It was heaven! There is a wonderful spa and Hammam. The 10 minute drive to the Medina was fine. It was nice to be separate from the hustle and bustle of the city and souks when returning to the hotel.

This hotel has nivea suncream by the pool for you to apply. It also has sunhats at your dispense by the pool.  There is a spa with a hammam thats free for all guests to use. I repeat - no added cost. (just so were clear it has a beautiful sitting room with coffee herbal tea fruits and dried nibbles. It has a sauna a steam room a hamam shower a jacuzzi a cold pool and an outdoor pool! Ladies and men seperate :) )  There is a seperate pool for kids and adults.  The breakfast is divine.  I bought something fragile from the market and asked staff for spare bubble wrap to protect it. They took it and wrapped it 6x over with ribbon and four seasons wrapping paper haha. Everything they do they do it perfectly.  Theres a games room with board games playstation Xbox basketball 1/2 court pool table football and pingpong.    This is THE best hotel i have stayed in (second would be the Westin in dubai!)  There are so many beautiful riads and nice hotels. But at the four seasons you are 10 min drive from the airport. 10 min drive from the medina and centre where the souks are. 20 mins from jardin majorelle and other beautiful sites.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Emma A wrote a review Apr 2018,50,A wonderful oasis,Stayed at the FS Marrakech for a week in March. The property is splendid and very much in keeping with other FS venues. The gardens and grounds are superb and offer a beautiful location to stroll and just enjoy the ambience. The pools and terraces are gorgeous - and so spotlessly clean. The adults only pool is a real treat for those travelling without kids and is magical first thing in the morning when the dark slate finish makes it look bottomless. The food is great - but as usual the vegetarian options are a bit limited. The restaurants do accommodate though and will prepare something bespoke if you request it. The rooms are lovely great standard and again spotlessly clean. The biggest draw of this property though is the staff. Everyone is amazingly kind friendly and helpful. Room allocation issues were sorted out for my friend and I (we had booked a twin and were initially offered a double with a sofa bed as the second bed). We ended up in a gorgeous terrace suite with pool - and the staff transformed the living room into a second bedroom for me which was utterly fine. On my birthday the staff in the restaurant made such a lovely fuss which was very unexpected and thoroughly delightful. I would recommend this hotel and it’s excellent spa as a great option for anyone looking to relax unwind recharge and enjoy that bright light in the sky that we don’t seem to have in the UK.

The rooms are extremely nice spacious and comfortable with a nice oriental touch Marrakech style. The gardens are sumptuous and kids can safely go alone all around. The two swimming pools are fantastic and the bar and restaurant service offers good treats if you want to fully profit the sun and the water all day. The area for adolescents/young kids is a must with games and videos. In many occasion we have eaten local tapas in the main building and we ave also tried the Italian restaurant. All good. The best is the breakfast. Although it is expensive it is probably one of the best offered in a hotel of such category. Just gorgeous! It allows us to take enough time to get back together and exchange in a relax manner while tasting all local and international food offered. We miss the Moroccan restaurant which was opened initially and then closed for a while. This is not a major issue though as there are extremely good in Marrakesh worth eating. The hotel is very well situated near the center and not far from the airport in the calm. Ideally located to visit all touristic spots or to go the desert or the Atlas. The fitness area and tennis court are very modern and impressive too.  However the top of the hotel is without any hesitation the staff always very helpful and professional even if in some cases there have been little concerns or confusions. Their readiness to come with a helpful solution is an example of how to treat the clients.  Just try this hotel if you can.

Facilities were excellent. Adult pool was great nice and quiet. Pool staff were very attentive. Lunch area can get very busy and you may have to wait for a table.  The hotel has 3 restaurants and all 3 were brilliant. Great service and excellent tasty food.    LOCATION:  Great location outside the Medina close to the airport but only 10/15 mins taxi ride into the Medina.    BREAKFAST:  Breakfast is good. Not very big but has most continental food as expected. A nice crepe station. They do have an a la carte menu but we only found this out on our third breakfast as we asked so would have been good to know from the start.    INTERNET:  Speedy Wi-Fi    ROOM:  Room is great. We had a garden view terraced suite as there were 3 of us. 2 people in the main bedroom and a bed was put in the lounge for the 3rd person.  The only thing we were missing was a full length mirror in the lounge area/bathroom leading off the lounge.  Ample lighting throughout the rooms.    BATHROOM:  The suite had two bathrooms one main ensuite leading off the bedroom and another bathroom leading off the lounge area so that was handy having two bathrooms between 3 people.  Bathroom nicely decorated and especially liked the robotic Toto toilet with remote controls on the side.  Shower power is not great and on occasions would take a while to heat up.    SERVICE:  Absolutely excellent service from all staff members we encountered. They really were attentive to our every need as expected in a 5star resort such as this.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,ewc628 wrote a review Apr 2018,40,"A very nice resort, but could use a dedicated concierge staff.",My wife four daughters and I stayed here for three nights. The property is very nice. The food was good - both restaurants catered to gluten free diets. The staff in the kids club was super friendly - even coming out by the pool to play with our children. A classic Four Seasons service example - our daughter was bit by a mosquito and needed itch cream... so the pool attendant searched the hotel for cream; when he couldn't find any he left the hotel to go buy cream and brought it to us for free. AMAZING! It is not quite at the same level as some other Four Seasons Resorts but for Morocco its excellent. Our one complaint is that the reception doubles as concierge. As a result half the time the staff is not well informed or even give inconsistent reviews. My recommendation is that they have one senior reception staff assigned to cover concierge questions or requests - when we had a senior member fo the staff we received excellent guidance.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,luxuriousliving wrote a review Apr 2018,50,Beautiful property for a winter break,My husband and I spent 6 nights in this hotel in February. The property is very convenient to the airport so you aren't travelling for too long after flying.    Upon arrival reception was a bit confused and they seemed to be understaffed. This continued for the rest of our stay. However this was the only negative aspect of the entire property. They definitely need to have a better concierge service. We ended up asking the bar staff to make reservations at restaurants for us which they kindly did on several occasions.    Our room was on a higher level overlooking the main adult pool. The room was spacious very comfortable and well appointed. We enjoyed sitting on our terrace too.    We LOVED the bar staff. The manager and her team were amazing. Full of helpful information and really great service. Absolutely faultless!    The pool guys were AMAZING too. Such great service consistently.    We ate once or twice in the hotel and the food was good.    We loved relaxing by the pool in the afternoon.    I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a luxurious break. We had considered staying at the Mamounia instead. Thank God we didn't! We had lunch there and you cannot compare the two hotels. Mamounia is dark and old fashioned with heavy carpets everywhere.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,JudMMonte wrote a review Mar 2018,20,Does Not Meet a Typical Four Seasons Standard,We've been fortunate to stay in amazing Four Seasons properties around the world so came into our stay with high expectations. Had this not been a Four Seasons property I might have given the property a three star (the saving grace here is the wonderful pool service staff) but with a strong brand name comes particular guest expectations.    The room: Over the course of our stay we killed dozens of ants in our bathroom; the bath tub had rust in it but was still used by my children daily. What is most disappointing is that the drain didn't work. Housekeeping drained the tub for us daily but it was not fixed over the course of our six days at the property. There was an old Red Bull can that was in the garden outside our room from the day we checked in to the day we checked out. These are things you just don't see at a typical Four Seasons Hotel. Also it was not uncommon to return to the room at 4PM in the afternoon and find the room still had not been made up for the day.    Food: We had many amazing meals on our visit to Morocco but none were at this hotel. Food and restaurant service at the FS Marrakech is underwhelming. Just about every order (with the exception of the pool restaurant and staff) had issues to the point we stopped letting them know about the problems. If heading to Marrakech and want a sure thing definitely head to La Mamounia or the Mandarian Oriental's Ling Ling. The service and food at these properties was out of this world.    Service: As I said we found the pool and outdoor restaurant service to be fantastic. The team went above and beyond like a typical FS does. Where things really go wrong is with the front desk and concierge.    While a FS concierge is typically the best in the business this FS has the front desk staff double as the concierge team. Leading up to our stay they were very unresponsive until my husband reached out to corporate for help. For those familiar with the brand you know that the FS concierge is typically reaching out to guests leading up to a stay to help with plans. This property does none of that.    Once at the property there is not an itinerary of booked activities or even a summary of activities happening at the hotel (though I asked for both multiple times). This lead to much confusion and morning calls from reception for tours we didn't know we were booked.    All that said although I asked the concierge to make an itinerary that followed the recommendations on their own website they indicated on multiple occasions that these itineraries were impossible. I later discovered it was because they prefer to book guests on canned group tours with outside companies that start and end at the hotel as opposed to curate private experiences.    As for activities below is what we tried:    Sunrise Hot Air Balloon Ride: Beware there are two morning times for this experience. One at 5:30 and one after. I discovered the hotel booked us on the second tour (which is not a sunrise ride). We were picked up by a driver that didn't speak English and brought us around to other hotels to pick up others for the ride before getting lost. We were up in the balloon for about a half hour before coming down (was supposed to be 45 mins - 1 hour). In the end the shorter ride worked out since the balloon operator didn't speak English well enough to provide any context about what we were looking at or how the balloon worked. Also I wouldn't recommend this tour for families with younger children as they insisted on splitting up our family for weight / balance issues and this is NOT a private tour so your little ones could be crammed into a compartment with strangers. If you are looking for just a pretty view and don't mind being crammed into a balloon with strangers it is probably okay.    Atlas Mountain Visit: We wanted to do this right after our balloon ride but the FS said it was impossible (despite the website suggesting this). After our experience with the balloon ride we asked the concierge / reception to ensure we were on a private tour advised that we wanted to follow the description of activities outlined on the website (see the waterfalls cooking class in local Berber village make mint tea etc.) and requested lunch at Sir Richard Branson's property.    While we went to the mountains in a private car the driver was not a registered guide and therefore did not provide the deep context and insights about the culture you come to places like Morocco to gain. We were also told that there was an event at the Branson property and it was therefore impossible to have a meal there. What's odd is that my husband reached out partway through our day and learned they would be happy to receive us for lunch. It makes one wonder if the Four Seasons even tried to secure the reservation...    In the mountains we had a lovely hike with a local guide and enjoyed the Berber museum tour. We didn't make tea we didn't have a cooking class - these things were not even offered as possibilities (though they were called out specifically on the FS website which we requested to follow).    Sahara Overnight: Leading up to our trip I asked them to help me with a helicopter ride to the Sahara for an overnight at a luxury tented camp. They indicated they wanted to speak about this on site where they proceeded to suggest driving 10 hours instead. We just didn't have enough time to warrant driving that distance and we continued to ask for a helicopter and also what camp they would book us in (I wanted to be sure my family would be comfortable with the accommodations) but there was no follow-up.    In short we stayed at this property as we have younger children and wanted to be sure we had a predictable property to return to at the end of an active day. For those in our similar camp I would plan to stay the the Mandarin Oriental. We actually would have moved to this property part way through our trip but they were fully booked.    Of note the desk manager reached out to us the day before our departure but by then it was far too late to rectify the issues with the booking of activities. The hotel manager also pulled my husband aside and offered him our last night free (equivalent of a $1000 USD credit). While that is all well and good when time is precious a hotel credit cannot come close to making up for lost time.    All in all I would recommend a visit to Morocco to everyone but advise all to stay at a different property.,Date of stay: March 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,United States,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Monte_Explorer
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,sbray wrote a review Mar 2018,50,As expected,The real reason to stay at the Four Seasons is for service. You're not just getting a room you're getting a team of people to make your stay great and this property is no exception. They were there for every detail and it was seamless. In fact I'm always amazed at how they can train everyone so well. That alone makes this a great place to stay.    The grounds were as beautiful as the pictures. We had two of the least expensive rooms and they were really good. Perfectly designed and spacious. The view was very nice to the mountains. I can't imagine that it was worth spending more for a room upgrade. As always bed linens pillows etc. are excellent.    The location is not really near the old town Medina. The taxi ride was perhaps ten minutes without traffic and 15 or 20 with. If you want a resort in Marrakech this is the place. If you want an authentic Riad near the Medina this is not what you want but having a resort to relax at was just what we needed.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Skylarkers wrote a review Mar 2018,50,Vivaldi Would Be Proud!,Bringing together a whole range of ingredients and making the sum of the parts seem more than each individual is an art rather like composing some fabulous piece of music.    The Four Seasons in Marrakech does this really well.    We had a 5 night stay and enjoyed every moment. Yes it's not cheap and anything you add on is pricey but it takes a lot to keep the whole show on the road.    Service is key and while we found a few issues at breakfast time they were fractional and probably seemed slightly magnified because every other area was so good.    Little things like local musicians playing in the main lobby each evening. Very talented and well produced with good accoustics all made for a lovely interlude.    I'm not very good at handing out 5 stars and generally feel that has to mirror perfection. No it wasn't perfect but as near as makes no odds.    Other people have written more than enough about the facilities and they are as good as they have described. The adult pool was the only one we used and it was superb with wonderful service.

Excellent service all round. A few of the best features for us were:    - The friendly staff  - Excellent kids club  - Lovely pools - one for adults one for kids  - The quality of food - a special mention for their meatball 'Crackpot'  - The superb breakfast buffet and dining area.  - The high speed wifi.  - The airport transfer (big Mercedes vans)    We went to Dubai for winter sun at the same time last year (One&Only Royal Mirage) and preferred Morocco - not least because you don't get a nose bleed when it comes to settle the bill!

Our room was beautiful- with a wonderful view of the hotels gardens and pool. A personalized welcome note from the General Manager Mr. Montandon was on the table upon arrival with a lovely fruit plate- it was a wonderfully warm welcome. Mohammed the Duty Manager greeted us upon arrival with a smile and whenever he saw us ensured to ask about our stay.    While at the hotel we met the Director of Operations Pierre- he introduced himself to us as he wanted to ensure that all was going well- throughout our stay he continuously greeted us when he saw us in the different outlets. I noticed he was constantly introducing himself to all the guests- at the pool at the restaurants in the lobby... he did such a wonderful job at making all guests feel welcomed and special.    The housekeeping staff did a fantastic job not only in cleaning the rooms but turndown. The rooms were beautifully appointed as well as serviced.    We had dinner at the Italian restaurant and both Tarik our server and Fernandino the restaurant manager were incredibly attentive and the dinner service was wonderful. Our glasses were never empty and at one point Fernandino noticed I was having trouble cutting my food- he instantly brought me a sharper knife without my needing to ask.    Our overall experience was relaxing and wonderful- a big thank you to the entire staff.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,TriangleTravelers wrote a review Mar 2018,40,"Luxury Retreat. Short of Perfect, but Good Recovery by the Hotel.",It is a gorgeous resort located about a 10 minute drive from the airport and about 10 minutes by car from the Medina. A nice escape from the busy center and it really feels a world away from the city and definitely delivered on a relaxing luxury vacation. There were a few misses by the hotel but they recovered quickly and to our satisfaction. In the end we had a wonderful time and the hotel catered to our every need and wish in true Four Season's style.    Communication with the hotel in advance of our trip was confusing due to some inaccuracies and inconsistencies in the messages from the hotel related to transportation and fast-track service options. We were very diligent to follow-up and clarify which I would recommend in a similar situation. It did lead to some moments of anxiety in advance of the trip. I highly recommend requesting the fast-track service for arrival and departure through immigration as the traditional lines were very long and the fast-track allowed our family to go through a private line and reduced waiting times by approximately 90 minutes. Even with fast-track it is still required to wait in a line to have bags scanned after baggage claim but this line moved quickly. The service is also available on departure which is also recommended. If you have lounge access from an airline or priority pass the lounge option is not necessary. We had one issue on arrival that the driver was late and had the wrong carseats but he was able to fix the carseat situation in less than 3 minutes which was a nice recovery.    The hotel is beautiful and the lobby area restaurant is built to feel like a Rhiad with removable roof over the center courtyard. There was mint tea upon arrival at the entry and beverages (hibiscus in 1 room and cold mint in another) dates local pastries and a fruit bowl in our rooms. Check-in was completely painless. The room was fully stocked with necessities for our family including a baby bathtub children's toiletry items and child sized bathrobes and slippers. The room was large and the outdoor terrace space was very nice. The fruit bowl was refilled daily and there was ample tea and coffee in the room (and available in the lobby) each day. The pools (adult and family) were both lovely with very attentive staff. The family pool is very well designed with multiple sections of different depths (including a section where toddlers can stand) and includes heated section (covered at night) which made late winter swimming possible. We didn't use it but there was also a slightly warmer family area (hot tub like area) heated to approx 30 C where many families were relaxing. Child-sized lounge pillows were available at the pool as well. The Kids Club is for children 4+ but younger children are allowed with parent supervision. The schedule varied each day but it seemed that most of the activities were in the afternoon. Children <5 eat free in the restaurants and at the pool (with the purchase of adult food) but this was inconsistently applied at the restaurants and we spent time at departure to remove charges that shouldn't have been applied. In the end the hotel removed them without a fuss but they shouldn't have occurred and we shouldn't have needed to bring it to the attention of staff.    The hotel is relatively isolated so you will need to plan to take transportation if you would like to leave the hotel. The hotel restaurants are lovely but expensive as you would expect. Items are available on the dinner menu for >190 MAD and breakfast is 350 MAD. The breakfast buffet includes a wide variety of European/American options local pastries omelets and pancakes. A full menu is available as are local specialties. We particularly enjoyed the 2 types of tagines breakfast soups and mint tea. They were thrilled that we were interested in local specialties and more than happy to bring anything we desired.    Overall a very special and wonderful resort for our visit to Marrakech as a family. The staff were responsive and lovely and although there were some small flaws the hotel recovered quickly and we would definitely visit again.,Date of stay: February 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Raleigh, North Carolina",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TriangleTravelers
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,PersephoneBrown wrote a review Feb 2018,40,Good but could be better,"We have just come back from a 6 night stay at this hotel and whilst we thoroughly enjoyed it there were a few niggles which prevented us from having the expected 5 star experience.  First the good: the hotel is beautiful all the common areas the rooms the grounds all understated Moroccan style very tasteful and very comfortable. We stayed as a family of four in a lovely two bedroom suite with a plunge pool. The surroundings were calm and tranquil no intrusive noise from anywhere despite the fact it is a large hotel close to the main road and just ten minutes from the airport. Quiet and effective air conditioning and a ceiling fan meant we were very comfortable at all times.  On checking in we were greeted in our room with drinks plates of traditional pastries and sweetmeats and a large bowl of fruit. A kitchen area provided tea coffee and plenty of complimentary bottled water.  Breakfast was included in the rate and was a superb buffet every day with plenty of choice - pastries fruit cold meats and cheeses egg bacon etc. plus a pancake and crepe station and omelette station.    Now the not so good:  Service was very erratic. Some of the staff were excellent others not so much. Although the breakfast buffet was fantastic what they don't tell you is that there is also an a la carte menu available with items such as Eggs Benedict. Not once were we offered this menu and it was only because on the second morning I saw a couple on a neighbouring table being served Eggs Benedict that I realised this menu must exist. I asked and one was produced however when my order arrived it was almost cold so I stuck to the buffet after that. The first morning we were offered juice and I asked for one of their ""detox"" juices. I was told that I could get one from the bar inside. After I'd returned to my table I saw the same juices being delivered to another table by a waiter. Another morning we asked for three different juices and they brought everyone orange juice. Tea was requested a couple of times and just didn't appear.  There are three restaurants - Inara (multinational cuisine) Azzera (pool bar open for lunch until 5pm) and Quattro (Italian and where breakfast is also served). Apart from Azzera where we had two really excellent meals the food was decidedly average most of the time. We did have a couple of good meals in Quattro (pork belly was good as was the ravioli) but chicken legs with crispy skin turned out to be flattened leg meat topped with (soft) breadcrumbs and linguine a la vongole was bland and swimming in cream (which doesn't belong in a proper vongole). The other thing that rankled was that when we asked for a red wine recommendation the waiter gave a name and said he would get it for us to try. When I asked him which one it was on the menu he pointed to the most expensive bottle there (about £70).We refused it and made our own choice. In fact the best wine we had there was a local vin gris (rosé) which was organic and once of the cheapest available at less than half the price of the one recommended.  Other niggles - when we arrived there was a leaflet listing the week's activities. We arrived Saturday night and the list went up until the next day (Sunday). The list was not replaced with the updated one before we left (despite the fact that I saw current ones behind the desk when we checked out). There is no book of hotel information - i.e.. services restaurant info etc. which is common in almost every hotel I've ever stayed in.  When we checked out the bill had all sorts of charges on it that were incorrect. On our first morning at breakfast a waiter brought a bill over which had full charges for 4 breakfasts. I queried this as I'd thought that breakfast was included. He confirmed that it was so I said that the bill should have zero charge and that we weren't going to sign it as it was. He brought a supervisor across who said that was just how they did it and that we wouldn't be charged. To be certain we crossed through the charges every morning before signing however when we got our final bill on checkout breakfast had been charged every day. After a conversation the charges were removed and a new bill printed out. We then checked it again and discovered that there were other charges to room services and restaurants on a day that we had been out of the hotel all day. These were subsequently removed but the whole checkout process took longer than it should have done. Particularly as I had called ahead to let them know we would be checking out and asked them to get the bill ready...In fact in every other 5 start hotel I've stayed in (and I've stayed in many all over the world) the bill up to that point is usually delivered to the room the night before checkout so that it can be checked at leisure.  There were other small negatives but this review is already long enough! So in summary a beautiful hotel and with more staff training and better chefs in the two main restaurants it could be exceptional but it's not quite there.",Date of stay: February 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Peterston-Super-Ely, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PersephoneBrown

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,apjp19 wrote a review Feb 2018,40,Just a little inconsistent,We’ve just returned from a 6 night stay at the Four Seasons Resort Marrakech. Overall it was great but I can’t give it a top score because there were a few failings that are unacceptable in a ‘Luxury Resort’ (their description) and considering the cost.    First of all our pre-arranged transfer to the hotel did not turn up. They put this right immediately and we didn’t have to wait too long as the hotel is very close to the airport. Housekeeping was a little inconsistent and I had to resort to leaving notes to make sure they left what we needed. I had to call them twice before they finally delivered something I had run out of in the room. On at least 2 occasions we did not have our room prepared for the evening. Our fruit bowl was not topped up daily and on the last night they seemed to give up completely and we ran out of bottled water. Given that we were recommended not to drink tap water this was a bit of a disaster.    However the staff were absolutely delightful and did go above and beyond to help especially at the pool and at the concierge desk.,Date of stay: February 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Marlow, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/apjp19

It’s five minutes by car from the centre of Marrakech but as a result it is very tranquil.  From the moment we stepped out of our Taxi we were treated royally by every member of staff we met.  Hanane on the Concierge Desk was our main contact (although her colleagues were all brilliant too). She took care of all restaurant bookings Taxis advice on tours etc etc. Extremely efficient. Pierre Kermanac’h was a hands on Director. Lots of good advice. Also great welcome from Jihane Barehmi (or Jane as we called her). Lovely welcome card from the General Manager Blaise Montandon and Brahmin Aboumounir in our room 210 (corner location overlooking pool).  Youssef the IT person was very helpful in setting up our iPad/iPhone. A very patient person.    The facilities at the Hotel are great. We spent time at the heated “ quiet pool” - there is a family pool too. The pool staff come around with delicious goodies - smoothie lollies fruit etc. Iced water. Just what you need.  The Gym is well equipped and peaceful. Lovely outdoor area if you want to stretch or practice Yoga on your own.  It was chilly our first day so we sat by a log fire in one of the sitting rooms drinking Moroccan mint tea. Reading their lovely books. Perfect.  Hanane organised Youssef to drive us up to the Atlas Mountains in the Range Rover one day. Wonderful trip. A good driver and a good guide.  It’s a very efficient Hotel with a calm relaxed atmosphere. Tranquil stylish decor.  Breakfast out on the Terrace is a great way to start the day. Lots of cooked breakfast choices including pancakes omelettesetc. - all cooked to order but the cold breakfast lacks exciting choices. It is a bit basic. More fruit choices and cereals yoghurts etc would be good.    We loved our stay and felt really refreshed by the time we left there. Nowadays “service” isn’t something companies seem to value but the Four Seasons has nailed it. Fabulous holiday.    Places to visit - the new Yves Saint Laurent Museum. A wonderful display of his work a lovely Cafe and a chic Shop. Buy a combined ticket with the Jardin Majorelle.    See inside the Theatre Royal.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Allison H wrote a review Feb 2018,40,Beautiful hotel with a couple of issues,"Just returned from a very enjoyable stay at the Four Seasons. The hotel is gorgeous and our suite (330) was lovely and big with ample room for a family of four - two bathrooms large balcony and the most comfy bed ever - pillows like clouds. Breakfast was great - try the crepes and pancakes and the omelettes and the juices from the bar! Five stars also for the pools kids club and young adult centre with its cinema and bank of computers - it gave me time to head off into the centre to do my shopping without having to worry about my kids disappearing off while I was haggling. I loved that they also thought of details such as providing factor 50 suncream and hats.    What really got at me though was that the hotel colludes in a taxi scam of ripping off its clients. Taxis charge 50dirham from the hotel to the medina as a flat charge (even if they have just dropped someone off) and won't put the meter on. This is illegal - taxis are required to use the meter (""le compteur""). When I took taxis from the djna el fnaa back to the hotel with a meter it cost me 15 dirham in the day and 22 at night (night surcharge). When I challenged the staff at the security/drop off point why they collude with this practice they couldn't see the problem. Four Seasons shouldn't encourage this scam. Once I knew what it was meant to cost I just gave the driver the money - which caused a lot of unpleasantness from them. I know that I'm only talking about being ripped off by about £5 or so but it's the principle that is wrong.    My other gripe is that there is no guest info folder in the room telling you times for breakfast pools check out etc. I found out from reading reviews of the hotel on tripadvisor (on our last day alas) that the hotel provides a free shuttle to the medina every day from 6pm. Would have saved me a lot of grief and money to know this.    The shop is a total rip off. I bought a bracelet for £130 that I found was £65 online (Loel & co).    Check your bill when you check out - I was charged 65dirham for ordering a small jug of fresh milk to my room for a cup of tea which is a real cheek when I'm paying £4000 for a week.    I hope I have saved readers some money. Apart from these very annoying rip-offs it is a gorgeous hotel and we had a lovely week there. It's a perfect place to stay if you have children. If I wasn't travelling with the kids I'd probably stay in one of the posh central riads instead.",Date of stay: February 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/allisonh241

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Joey P wrote a review Feb 2018,50,Amazing hotel and customer service!,Me and my boyfriend went for 5 days and stayed here and it really does keep you away from the hustle and bustle of Marrakesh. The staff were amazing all the way from checking in to getting picked up to go back to the UK. The staff were very helpful polite attentive. They always asked if there's anything else they could do for us. Our rooms got cleaned 2-3 times a day which I've never experienced before. Overall the service is FIRST class which was expected from Four Seasons. We were treated like VIPs!    The rooms were very spacious and had everything you need. Only thing I didn't see was an iron and ironing board maybe you needed to request for that. The beds were very comfortable and the bath was very deep which is very good for relaxing in.  The coffees and teas were topped up twice a day which is great as both of us love coffee and tea. When we went the weather wasn't very hot but we still managed to get a tan because of the balcony in our room and the sun was always facing us every morning and it felt like 25 degrees when outside is only 13. I think we just got lucky on this one. But yeah it was quite cold so a jacket was needed!    We had breakfast included in our room and I would say that the breakfast is very good. There was a good selection of food for everyone to enjoy. A lot of nice pastries as I could imagine that its influenced by the french they are very tasty! The fruit was so sweet and can I just point out that the freshly squeezed orange juice is just amazing there!    The pool was heated but was still a little bit too cold to go swimming but the jacuzzi was fine.    The ate at all the restaurants the food was ok wasn't too bad I think that's what they need to improve on. Otherwise me and my boyfriend had a lovely experience! We would definitely recommend this hotel and we would consider to stay again.,Date of stay: January 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,United Kingdom,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joeyp580

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,DGYSY wrote a review Feb 2018,50,The best hotel in Marrakech !,We booked this hotel through British Airways holidays and sadly missed our UK flight out therefore arriving a day late . The hotel extended our stay by an extra night ( it was low season ) free of charge so we all could enjoy our original planned 4 night break  The hotelis just over 6 years old and is only 5 minutes in a taxi outside of the Old City . The grounds are stunning ( feels a little like the Jumeirah Al Qasr hotel in Dubai ) with a lovely entrance and arrival  The hotel has three pools and a fabulous pool restaurant where we ate most days outstanding food with great service  We visited the traditional best hotels at La Mamounia ( poor ) and the Royal Mansour and although beautiful old traditional buildings  The Four season resort is better more relaxed informal yet smart and impressive . The bars and restaurants are lovely and the support team are superb throughout  Our rooms were on the first floor with great balconies overlooking the adult pool and are lovely  A problem with our water supply to the rooms was quickly compensated by Jihane our resident manager with a complimentary lunch around the pool and hotel car into the city one night which was very kind of the hotel  This is the best hotel in Marrakech from our experiences and strongly recommended for a luxury break with 4 out of 5 days sunbathing in late January !,Date of stay: February 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DGYSY

Two large outdoor heated pools and hot tubs are great spa is also very nice with all the amenities you need. Breakfast was very good as was the food in Quattro and Inara restaurants.

I do not remember the name of all the people who work there but they were all very nice.  Starting from Magdy and Leila at the reception desk that upgrade us in a Garden view room at our arrival to Badr who help us with all the excursions.  Housekeeping was exceptional!  Room always clean neat and tidy.  The door man always kind and with a smile!  Breakfast buffet very well assorted! Must try the pan cake!  The hotel is not in the very center but is 5 minutes taxi away...maybe better for those who like to stay in a quite place.  If you want to have a tour guide ask them for Aziz! They work with him and he’s the best!!! Fun prepared fast honest and very good photographer!  The only thing if I can say it is that the ambiente of the hotel were a little bit cold.

There is a courtesy bus service which can drop you inside the old city walls so you can go and discover the sights sounds and smells of this wonderful place.  Ground floor room 115 is on a corner very close to the main building in early February when it’s quiet this is fine but I would think it could be noisy when the hotel is busy. Beds are comfortable and the rooms spacious and well equipped. The staff are absolutely fantastic and very helpful and courteous at all times especially poolside and front of house. Breakfast is a buffet service with delights for all everything you could wish for and very tasty.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,handftravellers wrote a review Jan 2018,50,5 Star Luxury with still an Authentic Moroccan Experience,The Four Seasons Marrakech never fails to disappoint. We have stayed in numerous Four Seasons around the world and the standards upheld by the property are exceptional. Fantastic service was provided by Hanan and Pierre both whom were incredibly helpful and an asset to the Four Seasons. An incredibly personalised service with great attention to detail.    Rooms: We had booked two rooms both of which were located next door to each other. The interior was decorated very tastefully with a seperate walk in wardrobe a large bathroom with his and hers sink. The shower was also great and a number of branded toiletries are provided by the Four Seasons. The bed pillows mattress and linen was incredibly soft and great to sleep in.    Breakfast: The breakfast was beyond our expectations. The juices on offer as well as the selection of buffet options (including authentic moroccan breakfast dishes) all tasted great! More importantly the eggs were cooked to perfection (not over done and rubbery). For me the breakfast is the most important meal of the day and I could not be more happy with the selection put out by the Four Seasons.    Spa: The spa facilities were real 5 star luxury. The most soft slippers and bathrobes provided with exceptional staff who make you feel relaxed and calm. It was one of the best massages yet! The jacuzzi and steam rooms were immaculately clean.    Pools and Grounds: Most pretty and scenic views around the hotel with views of Atlas Mountains in the distance. An open log fire around the hotel in the evenings lit with candles and fresh roses. There are numerous pools with amenities provided such as fresh soft towels sun cream and great pool side food and drinks.

We enjoyed the meals at the pool restaurant with international and local cuisine. The hotel staff were superb without exception. We found them professional competent and polite.

However having stayed in this city previously (in a Riad the heart of the Medina) I’d recommend that if your looking for a spot of luxury in a busy city then this is a good option but it does lack a certain something that the Riads and hotels within the walls have in abundance - the true feel of This wonderful city.,Date of stay: December 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Christchurch, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SHOC06

The restaurants served a good mix of different cuisines and went to great efforts to keep the kids happy. We toured the souk with a guide provided by the hotel who was extremely knowledgable and made the experience very worthwhile. We also enjoyed a camel riding excursion.    What really set this place apart was the management. We had a few problems - mix up with an excursion booked through the hotel some towel cleanliness issues and a temporary nasty smell right by the room (blocked drain).

The standard rooms are ok a bit of dissapointment is there‘s only nespresso machines provided in the suites. Normal rooms offer water kettles only.  Turn-down service is good only because the provided water bottles decreased from day to day. The cleaning was done every day at the same high standard only on the first day I could recognize that it was done by an especially dedicated person who arranged my cosmetics in neat groupings. Very nice welcome this put a big smile on my face.    The breakfast area is beautiful the breakfast buffet offers all you could wish for. Only the coffee needs to be improved. The cappucino is served at such a hot temperature that one needs to wait at least further ten minutes to be able to drink.    I‘ve only visited the adult pool which is beautiful.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,nanotube wrote a review Dec 2017,50,"Beautiful, family friendly resort.",I booked Four Seasons for our first family holiday to Morocco after reading that riads would not be the most suitable choice with small children. A few days before departing some of the negative reviews concerned me a little but there was no reason to be. Having now become familiar with the city I'm very glad I didn't book a riad. Four Seasons was the perfect choice a beautiful resort away from the hustle and bustle of the old city allowing us to relax after a day of sightseeing. The staff were friendly and helpful. The kids club by the family pool is lovely and the young adults room is also a great addition with a pool table table tennis foosbool and vg consoles.    I highly recommend the spa and I wish I had time for more treatments. Access to the sauna and jacuzzi is complimentary which I wish I had known sooner!    We didn't breakfast at the hotel as we preferred to explore the many options in Marrakech but if you want to get out straight to sightseeing and not have to worry about food it would be the ideal way to fill up until the afternoon. We ordered room service on a number of occasions and the food and service are what you would expect from a hotel of this standard. We ate at Inara one evening the restaurant settings are beautiful but as others have said the menu offerings are somewhat lacklustre (this is just a comment not a criticism).  It's a shame that the Zest Bar was closed perhaps because of the time of the year. We went up to the rooftop area to take some photos and it would have been an enchanting place to have a drink if open.    Due to the location of the resort you will need to take a taxi to get anywhere. It may seem like you can walk but it wouldn't be advised if you have children however that's the case in general in terms of getting around Marrakech.    If you can extend your trip a few days beyond what you require to explore Marrakech and tours if you are doing any so you can relax and enjoy the resort itself!,Date of stay: December 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nanotube
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,paparaf wrote a review Dec 2017,40,Great Resort but do your own tour research,We loved the resort facilities themselves. It is a beautiful building well maintained and the staff are polite. It was a birthday treat for me and we were upgraded which was very good of the management. Where we would like to give feedback is on the tours arranged by the hotel. Due to them being about three to four times the price of a self arranged tour one has high expectations. We selected the tour of the Medina where the guide showed us the highlights of the Medina area. We found him lacking in knowledge in some areas but very well practised and motivated in taking us to certain shops in the hope of a purchase of a rug or lantern at extremely high prices. We felt as though we were being treated as walking cash machines. Even the restaurant he suggested turned out to be a flop. It served bland Harissa soup and extremely fatty lamb. We let him go after 2 hours out of 4 and made our own way around. We would stay in this hotel again without a doubt but we would do more of our own thing with respect to tours.,Date of stay: December 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Huntingdon, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paparaf

Leaving in the morning to see the Medina with its amazing bazar was amazing but coming back to the four seasons it felt like an oasis.  The rooms were luxurious and comfortable. I enjoy the exotic buffet that is offered every night the pool and of course you can not leave without trying the spa ( hammam treatment) you will feel 10 Year’s younger.

The staff willing to help us with our 6m child even changing the temp of the baby pool when we asked.  The food was also much better than we expected.  Forced to critise I’ld say they should have let us know if they were going to change our babysitter for someone new which they did three times. That said it was totally understandable as we often booked late and our stay was over Ede. Also the airport transfer was over priced.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,pamelasgold wrote a review Dec 2017,50,"Perfect location, best service, beautiful property!",Situated a short drive (10 minutes) from the the old city this Marrakech oasis is the perfect resort for a relaxing Moroccan vacation. The property is spacious has gorgeous grounds is totally magical at night because it's all lit up and the service is superb. Upon entering the property everyone is so friendly and truly makes you feel so welcome. The hotel smells divine the rooms are spacious.    We booked through Wedaways (a destination wedding and honeymoon management company that also books incredible romantic getaways) and the Four Seasons was the best choice hotel for Marrakech. The hotel has taxis that are always outside and the prices are better than if you were to get on your own and bargain. They really take care of you!    The food is delicious. We ordered room service and it arrived quickly and tasted as if we were eating in a gourmet restaurant. The breakfast well the breakfast takes the cake. Totally incredible. Fresh fruits and veggies salmon omelet station juice bar and my ultimate favorite- a crepe bar!

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Tom S wrote a review Nov 2017,40,40th birthday celebrations,Hi. Well there were no real surprises the Hotel and grounds are very pleasant.    After all it is a four seasons and across the world a successful combination of clean spacious well designed rooms and surroundings. With a similar build scheme to other four seasons. Sharm for example. The gardens are kept immaculately and the smell is amazing.    Staff are five star and the food at the pool restaurant is really good. The tagine most acceptable! We did eat however in the lobby restaurant one night the first. The food was pretty bland and for 130 gbp for two I expected a little more taste....more seasoning!!    Couple of other things that maybe the Hotel should look at. Air con control doesn’t glow when you press the button so you have to find a light if in the dark which is near enough to light the dial and not wake your partner up.    Maybe put an espresso coffee machine in the room? I like coffee and when spending a load of money on a room i don’t really expect to be drinking freeze dried regulation coffee.    Fruit was never replaced and the walls of the room had dirty marks around the switches. Again not really what you’d expect.    All in all an odd one really. Would I go back? I’m not really sure given the cost and the fact there’s a few little gremlins that need sorting. Better the devil you know or maybe go for a similar level of Hotel in Marrakech with a bit more Moroccan influence in the design and layout and see what that’s like.....hmmm.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Alistair M wrote a review Oct 2017,50,great place in Marrakech,We stayed 6 nights in October 2017 - with 3 kids: 16 14 10. This was our first visit to Marrakech and we had a great time. The hotel is terrific - really well run and everyone is very friendly. They had memorised us - and for example our evening drink preferences - by Day 2. The kids pool is good - with warm and cold options. Although it was UK half-term it wasn't too busy. The weather was excellent. The hotel is a short taxi ride into Marrakech and they arranged a great dinner venue for us in the city. Our only gripe was that we weren't offered a breakfast-included option and the only option on-site was an expensive buffet - so we ended up just ordering room service breakfast for what we needed - which ended up much more cost effective. But overall we had an amazing time and we'll definitely return.,Date of stay: October 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Radlett03

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,JDTRAVELBrighton wrote a review Oct 2017,50,Lovely resort hotel close to Marrakech,This is definitely a resort hotel and laid out over a large area. They are very family friendly and have a good pool however there is also an excellent adult pool where you are truly spoilt and looked after. The rooms are large and have Moroccan touches but also quite international in flavour although all the balconies and terraces have a Moroccan arbour with cushions. Some of the villas also have their own private dipping pools. The breakfast area has a lovely vista looking down a water feature. There are tennis courts and a well appointed gym plus plenty of space for those who want to go jogging around the extensive grounds as well as a great spa. This is an alternative for those who want to be able to visit the hustle that is Marrakesh but prefer a resort location in a slightly quieter area but still relatively accessible and has one of the best adult pools in the area.,Date of stay: October 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Brighton,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JDTRAVELBrighton

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Jonny6511 wrote a review Oct 2017,50,Perfect,We spent a week at this hotel and it was perfect from start to finish. On check in we were upgraded to a suite and that made a huge difference to our experience. The pool staff were excellent and made the time we spent at the pool extremely enjoyable. Ice creams  smoothies and other goodies were brought round on a regular basis . Tip - check out the main pool before you settle on the adult only pool as we had it to ourselves most days as very few families were visiting .  The food in the restaurants was excellent but could maybe do with another restaurant to add a bit more variety for those on longer stays .  And finally a special thanks to Sofia who really looked after us on a couple of occasions . She is an extremely interesting lady who is very good at her job . We had a very nice afternoon on our last day chatting to her . On that note I would like to compliment the hotel on their choice of staff . Every one of them that we came into contact with were a credit to the hotel and the four seasons brand. Friendly and also most efficient at all times .

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Lindsay D wrote a review Oct 2017,50,A beautiful oasis in the middle of Marrakech,We stayed at this property for 4 nights in late September. It is a fantastic property. While not having the character of some of the Riads or a Kashbah Tamadot you know what you get at 4S and this property is so large you feel like you are in your own world. Security is tight and so you feel safe at all times.    Service is exquisite - staff were friendly attentive and always looking to help. Our son would have a “coffee to go” each morning and the waiter knew to expect him! There was a delightful hostess in the Italian restaurant I can’t recall her name but she was from New Caledonia a new hire at the hotel and she was super friendly and responsive - I think a real find of an employee with much potential.    The lobby is very cool emulating a Riad courtyard with a sliding roof that was open during the day and closed at night. You can have drinks or eat in this area.    The gym was super well equipped with one room dedicated to cardio and one to strength with knowledgeable and attentive staff. There were two clay tennis courts as well.    We ate at the Italian and international restaurants and had room service one night. All the food was exceptional. Probably the most extensive room service menu that I’ve ever seen in any hotel and very reasonably priced.    With the exception of the $35 US breakfast buffet the food prices were very reasonable for 4S. The server didn’t tell us the price of the breakfast buffet before we elected to pick it. The 2nd morning we dined from the a la carte breakfast menu which was much more reasonable priced. The lunch and dinner menu are very reasonably priced...so just beware of the breakfast buffet!    There is a very large adult and family pool. The one afternoon we found that the family pool was actually quieter and hardly had anyone at it while the adult pool was busy. We ate at the poolside restaurant one day for lunch and the food drink and service was excellent.    We walked through the conference centre area which was huge and looked like a great place for meetings or weddings.    The resort is close to the airport but about 15-20 minutes to downtown and there isn’t anything within walking distance of the hotel so you need a car or taxi to go anywhere. There is a mall about 10 minutes away by car. They are building extensively in the area with other hotels and high end shopping so this will be a really upscale burgeoning area in the next 5 to 10 years.    Bottom-line another superb 4 Seasons property! Very much recommend it.,Date of stay: September 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Toronto, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/926lindsayd

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,JMFHospitality wrote a review Sep 2017,50,"Better than ever, this hotel just gets better and better","This is my second time staying at this hotel. The first time was the year that it opened and I did not like it very much (long story that I will not go into here). I am so very happy with the way the hotel has evolved both physically and experientially. The gardens are a highlight I had so much joy just wandering the grounds at different times during the day.    The best part was the service it feels the same as a S.E. Asian Four Seasons. The smiles attention too detail and genuine care that the staff have for the guests is palpable. I stayed for a week and loved every minute of it and look forward to my return.    What sets a hotel apart from the rest is the way that they deal with unexpected situations. While at the hotel I had an unexpected medical situation. Even as a lifelong expat when you get sick in a foreign country its stressful and traumatic. There is no greater feeling of security and comfort as when you know you are being well looked after. The GM Blaise Montandon was an absolute ""rockstar"" in handling me and my situation. He went above and beyond the call of duty by personally escorting me to the hospital and staying by my side long into the night to make sure that I was well looked after. Thank you to Blaise and his amazing team for taking such exceptionally good care of me.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,waynejscott wrote a review Sep 2017,50,First Impression Overcome,"A delightful 4 day stay at the Four Seasons Marrakech was blemished only at the check in experience. We were told with no apology that our room was not ready (though it was after check in time) and ""perhaps you'd like to have lunch or visit our gift shop"" (translation: pay double retail while waiting for our competence to catch up with our standards). We were also told we'd be called when the room was ready . .. we weren't. Regardless the rest of the stay was Four Seasons quality. I'd say the staff (other than at check in) were as friendly and helpful as any anywhere. The pool is a delight and the breakfasts (included) were great (omelette station).

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Theo H wrote a review Sep 2017,40,Holiday with children aged 4 and 9 and grandparents,this is a lovely hotel but far from the standard i expected from four seasons. Having stayed at 3 others in the last few years- the attention to detail by staff falls short of what you would come to expect.  Only staff so far that are a credit to the hotel are those by the family pool. Reception do not seem interested unless you are french or of another nationality.  As a family we do not expect doors to be opened etc but simple things such as correct bills to pay. Correct rooms on arrival ( sorted promptly ) but again not to be expected by the FS. No English papers but lots for other nationalities. Stated 4 days in a row they would get one....still waiting. Plus points are rooms and pools are lovely and quiet. Kids club brilliant and simira is great with our youngest who always refuses to go in to a club but did on this holiday.  All in all great hotel and holiday. Just those extras you'd expect from the four seasons are lacking which is such a disappointment.  Would i stay here again ?

I was also not made aware that a separate charge is made for using the tennis courts.    However Pierre is the most wonderfully charming and accommodating manager. when I brought the lunch issue to his attention he immediately halved the bill. Pierre also very kindly allowed me to play tennis at a very late hour with my.family.and also waived half the cost of the court hire.    the only thing that would make this hotel truly perfect is if it had a very large heated pool for children given the one that is there is modest in size and the family pool although large is a bit too cold for the children to spend a long time in    thank you for looking after me.and my family and I look forward to returning    overall...it was a wonderful experience and I would not hesitate to return.,Date of stay: August 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sajitabbas1
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,John B wrote a review Sep 2017,50,Best experience I ever had at a hotel,"Well after spending a week at this fabulous Four Seasons Hotel and Resort in Marrakech I am afraid that no other experience will be in the same league. From beginning to end the beautiful surroundings food and service were top notch. The hotel is surrounded by an oasis of plantings--olive trees roses succulents a paradise. There are two pools one a family-oriented one and one for adults. There are several restaurants on site serving breakfast lunch and dinner and live entertainment in the main lobby area (usually a vocalist or someone playing the guitar or a local instrument) of high quality in the evenings. We grew especially fond of the staff at Inara the restaurant and bar in the lobby area. Our friends there included Merouane Youssef Sara Sophia (the manager) and Ayoub among others. These lovely people gave us the best possible service with friendly smiles every time and expressed sincere interest in us and in our experience in Marrakech. We looked forward to going to Inara every evening to have a drink before bedtime and to talk with the staff and listen to the excellent live music (including gnawa a haunting genre that dates to the times when Africans were enslaved and shipped to other parts of the world in chains). A local man with a long list of pop song covers also performed very very beautifully. The bartenders are very talented and the servers and manager at Inara are the kindest most social people I can imagine. I learned as much about Morocco from them as I did from my visits to other parts of Marrakech! The highlight each day was stopping there to interact with them each evening enjoy a perfectly made cocktail and review the events of that day. Thank you Inara staff! You are the jewel in the crown of the hotel. I should also mention that security at the hotel is very good and we felt very safe and protected there. Our morning security man Abdellatif and our evening security man Belhassan always had the widest smiles and friendly greetings for us as we exited and entered the hotel each day. Our housekeeper Laile was efficient and solicitous and provided everything we needed each day to be comfortable in our room. Rachid who works out front substituted for the usual tea man who was on holiday and kindly gave us a lesson in making traditional Moroccan mint tea; thank you Rachid! The lovely woman in the lobby boutique store (which is gorgeous by the way) gave us pointers in how to bargain for goods in the souks; she even wrote down some useful Moroccan Arabic words and phrases for us (""zouine"" beautiful!). The rooms manager Pierre greeted us warmly upon our arrival as did the staff at reception (Leila and Shiyue among others). All of these fantastic people made our stay the most wonderful time I have had anywhere. I actually felt deeply sad to leave this hotel. I look forward to going back someday and seeing everyone (and of course Marrakech) again. Well done Four Seasons!

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,330nick wrote a review Sep 2017,50,Wow! First class hotel and first class staff. Faultless.,"We have recently returned from a two-week stay at the Fours Seasons and can honestly say it was faultless. The outstanding feature of this hotel - as many many reviewers have already said - is the staff they are truly outstanding. Everything you ask for is met with a ""you are welcome"" and you certainly feel everyone in the hotel really means it. They really couldn't do enough to help you. We had one poor experience with housekeeping not replacing the towels and within 5 minutes new towels were delivered and when we returned from a night out we had a bouquet or roses AND a letter of apology waiting for us. Outstanding service. The hotel and service was so good that we barely set foot outside the hotel preferring to spend our time around the adult pool and enjoying the pool service. Ice water is brought round at regular intervals together with fresh fruit ice creams and shots of non-alcoholic fruit cocktails. They'll even clean your sunglasses. Special thanks for outstanding pool service around the adult pool should go to Abdullah who could not have been more helpful and courteous. In fact all the pool staff where great.    It's very hard to find fault with any aspect of the hotel. The guide the hotel supplied for a tour of the Soukhs was also outstanding and in fact booking it through the hotel was cheaper than our tour operator. Special thanks should also go to Sofia and Mousse at the Inara Resturant who looked after us so well during our stay. We also need to thank Kacem and all the staff and managers at the Azzera Restaurant.    We stayed in a ground floor pavilion twin bedded room which was lovely and had very easy access to the adult pool via the patio. The room was well equipped.    There is plenty to do for the children with a great kids club games centre with pool table x box play station wii and great cinema room. Not to mention internet cafe. The children even have their own pool which is well separated from the adult pool a real plus point.    This is a Four Seasons hotel and prices for food and drink reflect that but portions sizes are generous and we found we could share two courses easily between 3 people. Breakfast is £35 per person although you could hop in a taxi for 5dhr and go to Victor Cafe (French boulangerie) in the Menara Mall which is 5 minutes round the corner and serves excellent breakfast brunch and lunch. There is also a Carrefour Market in the Mall which has a good selection of wine.    We ordered room service a couple of time and it was delicious and arrived on time extensive choice of dishes.    The concierges were excellent and more than happy to book restaurants or alter bookings on our behalf.    We really can't express in this short review how impressed we were with the hotel the management and staff. We have already decided to return next year and look forward to seeing everyone.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,CateauNL wrote a review Aug 2017,50,So great with children!,Chose the FS over my regular one (La Mamounia) in Marrakech for my 1st trip abroad with my 5-year old goddaughter. Did so because FS hotels do have a reputation for making the little ones feel welcome. And they delivered far above my expectations. It's not only about having a kid's club or a family pool but the whole staff is trained to make children feel like special guests. Sofie at the front desk took time out every day to entertain my goddaughter. Waiters at breakfast made her special pancakes. One of the highlights for her was our 'pyjama dinner' where we had room service delivered to the terrace of our suite. Our waiter was making this so special for her. On my return there was a hiccup with a spa invoice but this was solved in the end in a very correct manner by management. As a person not being used to travel with a young child the FS made our vacation a very special one for both of us.,Date of stay: April 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CateauNL

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Mona J wrote a review Aug 2017,50,Exceptional service !,My husband and I stayed at the four seasons for a night and we were completely amazed by the exceptional service!    At the time of booking we mentioned that we will be bringing our 9 month daughter with us and to our surprise when we entered the room the baby crib was already set up along with a changing table and all baby mustela products. Unfortunately we decided last minute to keep the baby home so we never used the baby services but we are definitely coming back!,Date of stay: July 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Casablanca, Morocco",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MonaJay89
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,jacquess491 wrote a review Aug 2017,50,a magic stay in Marrakesh - no snake charmer's story,In July 2017 I had the pleasure to stay at the Four Seasons Marrakesh with my daughter as a college go away present to her. I am a frequent stayer with the FS chain both for business and pleasure. On this tripe we came from George V FS in Paris and from the Casablanca FS to Marrakesh. The property is amazing lined up with palm trees and villas and the Mediterranean/desert combo vegetation. The property sports both an adult pool and a family/children's pool. We stayed away from both because be enlarge the staff planned for us off premises activities. If you are a privacy seeker and do not like self important phone loud talking individuals in various languages of the world I suggest to frequent the adult pool after hours and get a seat away form the crowds. I highly suggest Inara for fresh Morrocan and specialty Marrakesh dishes. I confess I did not go to the other restaurants on premises simply because Inara had it all: the lounge the outdoor dining the welcoming service hovering over you and the freshness of the food. The room was spacious comfortable and cool considering the 108F degrees heat during the day. The gym was adequate (my daughter body builds and has to work out every day) but the air conditioning was lacking and after working out a sweat my daughter felt very fatigued from the heat. Special tanks to Blaise Montandon hotel manager and Pierre Kermanac'h and to Rita for the personalized attention given to us on this trip. Overall I highly recommend staying at this property.,Date of stay: July 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Nw York, United States",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jacquess491
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,superman_lover wrote a review Aug 2017,50,A great place to spend a birthday,Wow! First things first - don't hesitate to book a stay here!  My daughter turned 6 whilst me my daughter and wife stayed at the resort. Ahead of our stay we were concerned about the reviews that were being posted on trip advisor - so I contacted the hotel ahead of the visit to let them know that my daughters 6th Birthday was a very special occasion that we had chosen to spend it at four seasons. I do not regret coming and in fact I'm already planning on visiting again at least twice in the next year.  We booked via British Airways and landed at marrakech airport on Thursday 27th July. When we landed we had issues (along with other European travellers) using our visa cards to withdraw cash for our taxi ride. So I rang the hotel and they arranged for a car to pick us up from the airport within 10 minutes. This was the first moment of truth - the hotel did not let us down from this point.  The check in was very smooth in fact when we got to the room there was a card for my daughter to welcome her to the kids club (great idea). We then settled down to eat food in the morrocan restaurant. I must say that the food was lovely - I had the sea bass tagine.  Each morning at breakfast the heads of departments would be very visible and get to know guests. We got to know Nabila (good luck with your labour) Abelsaf and Nila. Abelsaf was very useful in organising a birthday cake/surprise for my daughter at the family pool - thank you. The staff went to great lengths to ensure that it was special for her including making sure that everything was Scooby Doo themed - thank you.  My daughter had a awesome time at the kids club and the guys there really do a fantastic job of keeping the kids entertained. Not only do the kids clubs staff keep the kids entertained but also the lifeguard team too. The lifeguard team are like no other - they get involved in interacting with all guests at the pool side / including facilitating water based games.  After speaking to Nabila - me and my wife decided to go to the spa for a hammer. Oh my God was it worth it! I had a guy called Zohour and he spent an hour with me and I must say that my skin glowed at the end. I'm not sure who my wife had but she was also glowing too. Readers - must check out a hammam in Marrakech whether at the four seasons or elsewhere. We decided to do it at the four seasons because we did not want to be too far from out daughter in case of anything. However there were parent who were comfortable enough to leave their kids in the kids club whilst they went to the atlas mountains. This is a reflection on the quality of the kids club at four seasons.  Everything about the four seasons marrakech was perfect. I may have missed something but in summary - Staff - great helpful HAPPY and polite. Staff are obsessed with excellence.Rooms - large and cleaned regularly. Food - good quality made on demand - not buffet. Spa - unmissable. Kids club - awesome (according to my daughter).  Thank you four seasons for a great experience👍😎,Date of stay: August 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Orpington, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/superman_lover

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,zzzjad wrote a review Jul 2017,50,Great resort,Last month we stayed at the Four seasons Marrakech. The staff were very nice and polite. The residence room was very spacious and comfortable. The bathroom had a jacuzzi shower toilet and 2 sinks. There were 2 balconies with a Moroccan architecture. The breakfast had many Moroccan dishes. The general manager stopped by everyday to talk to us.    The only drawback was that the breakfast was served outdoors. It was 50 degrees centigrade and we would have preferred an indoor dining. They brought us a fan to cool us.    The receptionists were very courteous. They ordered us taxis to go to various places at a set price of 50 dirhams which is about $5.50.    We have stayed at many resorts all over the world ad we found this place to be one of the best resorts we have stayed at.,Date of stay: July 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"San Jose, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zzzjad

I have traveled a good deal and never encountered such a fantastic group. It is like the Ritz without the pomp. We were celebrating our 25th Anniversary and were surprised when returning from dinner our first night and they brought a cake and champagne. Their food recommendations were spot on as well as the other activities (Hot Air Balloon Ride The Berber Experience and Guides for Souks/Historical Sites).The grounds are impeccable well manicured and beautiful. We did not want to leave!! The rooms were very spacious with perhaps the best shower I've had in a resort (perhaps from the long flight??).

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,richardmboulter wrote a review Jul 2017,50,Professional and friendly well run hotel,We spent 7 nights at this hotel. Spacious and luxurious rooms and suites. 40 hectare site so lots of room for everybody. We were there in July - plenty of room at both of the large pools and at breakfast. We have been to plenty of good hotels around the world but this is one of the best. Everything simply works and if something needs attention it gets taken care of immediately. The staff is friendly helpful well educated and well trained - all fluent in several languages. Often it is the small attention to details which make a difference for instance free iced water fruit drinks and ice creams served to you throughout the day! Dinner tends to be a bit over priced and the portions small and here we recommend guests simply jump in a taxi and go downtown - Marrakech only comes alive at night anyway and the experience so unique it would be a shame to sit around in the hotel.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,World T wrote a review Jul 2017,50,One of the best resorts I have ever been to,Honestly I loved this resort. The rooms are a bit pricey but worth the spending. If you get a room in the main building or upper pavilion (bungalows) they are both great. The pools were fantastic. The food was amazing they had fresh lobster and all sorts of options at the pool and restaurants. They had so many amenities that we never left the hotel! The city does not have much to offer. We took one day and went and saw the city and medina but the hotel was honestly so relaxing and wonderful we would go back instantly. While at the pool they serve water ice cream refreshments complimentary etc. would highly recommend it!! The four seasons Casablanca was NOT like this at all. Marrakesh was amazing.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,2rna wrote a review Jul 2017,50,"My beautiful oasis , beautiful hotel , amazing staff , great food and what a memorisable holiday",This was the first time we left our son and came on a couples holiday for my birthday    I'm so happy that I chose the four seasons to do that on the minute we are right we felt looked after and thoroughly spoilt    The rooms are lovely and big they have a very beautiful Moorish decor and the colours used are very calming  huge bathroom section with shower and a separate bathroom separate bathroom  They have a whole walk-in wardrobe style closet which is amazing and one of the most fabulous balconies.    That's grounds of the resort itself is outstandingly beautiful palm trees everywhere beautifully maintained we saw from morning tonight having it maintained by different types of workers nothing was out of place now rubbish lying around all plants and trees were looked after and really clean    As it was my birthday we were surprised with a birthday cake  bottle of champagne  flowers and a birthday card so thank you to the four seasons for making me feel special    Nipple area is the best part of the hotel and as we didn't have our child with us we were in the outdoor pool which was so calming and so zen from the minute to go to the pool the waiters the workers would not let you think that they would arrange your shade it would bring your towels they will arrange your bed the way you wanted it make sure you had cold glass of water and frat the day they would bring your ice cream or water and whatever you asked... a special thank you to saeid ...    As the weather was very hot we had our lunches by the pool at Azzera restaurant  lovely fresh seafood great quality of food it was on the more expensive side but you were at the four seasons.    Staff was super attentive and anything you asked what was never enough and they would make sure they would do everything to make you feel comfortable.    We had dinner twice at Inara and it was not bad I still preferred the Azzera lunches in general I found the meat in Morroco on the dry side . Their mint teas and Shisha was great  ambience was 100%    Breakfast was on a super expensive side and worked out as maybe £35 per person for an breakfast buffet style  as I'm not a big water especially when it's an buffet for us it worked out expensive for the amount we ate so the next day we had ordered A la Cart which I believe was better quality and the food served to you warm.    If you want to workout there is a 2 km trip made around the grounds of the around of the hotel which is amazing to run and the gym is very up-to-date    Do you to all the palm trees and the lash grounds when you came back form the stuffiness of the Medina there just a was fresh air and oxygen to breathe and it made you appreciate the hotel even more    This is the first holiday that my husband sat down to relax all the four days we were there due to the fact that the hotel the grounds the staff everything was perfect and if we do ever go back definitely we shall return    I already miss my holiday and wish I was back,Date of stay: July 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2rna

Seemed close to UK and authentic so wanted to give it a go. So pleased I did.  I took two of my children and we had a FAB stay.  There was great young adults centre for them to use as well as a gym.  The restaurants were great especially the poolside one.  The concierge recommended great venues to eat and the hotel felt very safe and secure. Plus just 10 mins from airport and 10 mins to town. And the market was great fun especially watching my children try to haggle in French!  A very convenient location.  The main pool is an absolute stunner. Very long and the temperature was perfect. I swam all day and evening too. Great.  Pierre the Director of Rooms has recently arrived for Paris FS so knows his stuff and was attentive and welcoming.  Can't wait to go back.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Adtaerotech wrote a review Jul 2017,40,Honeymoon with a 1 year old,We booked the four seasons for our honey moon online and added a cot for our 13 month old baby.  Landing in the airport we hadn't booked a lift and went to the taxi rank to be set upon by the drivers. It was pretty scary to be honest and they all wanted 200 Dirham. I went into instant haggle mode and stuck to 100. Eventually we got a lift. Hotel security is very visible. The taxi got searched at the gate and we were met at the door my a concierge and 2 more security. It was very reassuring.  As expected the hotel is immaculate the staff are incredibly nice and they all loved our little boy who toddled around the halls and the security guards broke protocol to coo over him and make him laugh. It was lovely to see. The family pool was really nice with varying depths and areas. (There's an adults only pool too.) make sure that you book your breakfast inclusive. Although delicious is was about £58! So later we walked to the minera gardens and mall about 15 min walk and got an equally nice breakfast at la table du marché for bout £8 total.  I generally offered 50 about dirham for any taxi ride anywhere. It was usually accepted with great gusto. We only had one death ride but the 4 a day we took were fantastic. Speaking some French goes along way with Arabic thankyous thrown in too.  We went to the market square jamaa el faa most evenings putting baby in a sling on one of our backs. The locals LOVE babies. They would cross the road to say hello and would often kiss or try to kiss him. Took a day to get used to this. But they genuinely love babies. We never felt threatened. But obviously kept a close eye on everything going on.

It is approximately a 4-5 euro can drive from the Medina which means it has a little more fresh air than the stifling city centre. Cabs are readily available and we were quite content with the location. The resort is beautifully kept with a clean nod to the location in design and architecture. The rooms are spacious and superb as always the pools are spectacular. The food was average I would say and mostly international.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Roy M wrote a review Jun 2017,50,Pampered,"Isn`t it a minefield when you travel away from home and have to take a chance? We were so pleased we chose the Four Seasons. We are used to staying in good hotels and our recent trip to Florence would be hard to beat.    We were truly pampered. The welcome to the goodbye was sandwiched with fabulous service. We always felt that the staff were genuinely interested in our comfort. From the reception to the swimming pool the restaurants and the drivers. All were exceptional.    We stayed during Ramadan and they had a locallly inspired buffet each evening in the main restaurant. Problem was that they had the same singer every night. I do question that unless it was always going to be a different set of diners expected. We found that very repetitive.    There is a wonderful balcony restaurant though I would rather see a different menu and better standard of cooking.    The salads in the pool side restarant were way below par. I did mention it and they were very apologetic and made amends with a free dessert For me the food did not match the fantastic surroundings and they really are. We did get out and about each day and this was our oasis in the madness of Marrakesh.    The hotel arranged our excursions and did a good job. It was always seamless and the lovely reception staff handed us over beautifully to who ever we were going on a trip with.    Recommend using the hotel Range Rover for the Atlas mountains and eating at Richard Bransons hotel. Lovely driver and great trip.    The spa although not cheap is amazing! We had the Hammam or as I call it ""vertical waterboarding"" first then later in the week a fantastic massage. Its not just the treatments though.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,casparmac wrote a review Jun 2017,40,Best massage in the world!,Compared to other Four Seasons and to other top end hotels in Marrakech the decor in the main areas is not up  To scratch ; the food service is slow and it's a very spread out hotel- is decided not to come back as I've stayed at other much better hotels in Marrakech- I visit 3 times a year- but I have changed my mind! The people are charming willing and helpful the rooms are large  comfortable and kept beautifully by room staff and although I have weekly massages wherever I am- this was the best ever!

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,tobyjake wrote a review Jun 2017,50,A luxurious calm and serene place to unwind,Second visit and we were not disappointed. Every need is catered for and no detail is too small. The staff without exception seemed genuinely pleased to look after us - and all (whatever their position) greeted us with a smile and 'hello'.  A separate pool for the youngsters made the adult pool a calm and relaxing environment with pool boys periodically coming round with fruit/ice creams/smoothies etc. We met some very nice people around the pool on this trip.  We shall return soon.  My only suggestion would be for the installation of underwater pool lights so that evening swimming is more enjoyable.,Date of stay: June 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Sidmouth, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tobyjake
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,ARMAMANI wrote a review Jun 2017,50,Travelling with Kids?,There are three best hotels in Marrakech: Royal Mansour Mamounia and Four Seasons. Because it was our first time in Marocco we visited all these three hotels before check-in. All of them are amazing but If you travel with kids do not hesitate - stay in Four Seasons and...go to Royal Mansour and Mamounia for delicious dinner (and to see amazing architecture and gardens).  Four Seasons is not so centrally located as the other two but just 10 minutes (5 USD) taxi ride from Medina (old city). Comfortable rooms (pavilon ground floor close to the pool) delicious food and perfect huge swimming pool for families with kids - completely separated from adults's pool. Exceptionally friendly staff very helpfull with organising trips like shopping desert baloon flight.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,vegaslamb wrote a review Jun 2017,50,Luxurious Oasis,My husband and I had accidentally booked a horrifying riad experience in the middle of the worst part of The Medina. Each night we were dogged by motorcycles flying past us with no care as we tried to make our way to dinner and the souks. After two literally terrifying nights I moved us over to The Four Seasons and didn't leave the property for two days. Great location for planning excursions into the souks and to Jemma al F'na. The food and service were amazing. Great entertainment at dinner. The spa was first rate. I enjoyed a massage and spent several hours in the jacuzzi and cold plunge pools. So quiet and peaceful. The antithesis of the previous two days in the Medina. Don't be a hero you're not Indiana Jones.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,yatsey wrote a review Jun 2017,50,Excellent for kids,I recently stayed at the hotel with our two young daughters (<5). I can't speak highly enough of the service we received from absolutely everyone in ensuring we had a enjoyable stay. Baby amenities are provided and its nice that children under 5 are not charged at the restaurants. Its an easy 15 minute transfer from the (brand new) airport and also easy to go into the medina via taxi which we did a few times. A horse carriage is well worth a go to explore the town. The kids club is well run and a nice escape from the sun even if you just want to pop in for an hour to do some painting etc. Just two suggestions for the hotel to consider (1) There is a separate family pool which is good so you don't feel self conscious about disturbing other peoples quiet vacation. But it would be good if they had a slide or fountains in the pool area to keep the kids amused. (2) staying during Ramadan is fine although the dinner buffet is exactly the same every night and became tiresome - I think this was also because one of the restaurants was closed at the time for renovation. I would happily recommend this hotel to any families.,Date of stay: June 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,london,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yatsey

Bathrooms spacious and modern.    The hotel is magical at night. It really comes alive.    Service was very good. Very personal. I had a few issues (see below) and they were resolved promptly and beyond expectations. Rita on the front desk was awesome.    Security was amazing.    The food was very good. I travelled during Ramadan and the ftour buffet was great with awesome nightly live music.    Concierge organised a few tours. All ran very smoothly. Marrakech is an astounding place to visit.    Gym and fitness facilities also very good for a hotel. With great seperate cardio and weight rooms. Plus tennis courts and coaching.    The pools were very nice. The quiet pool was really nice. I was lucky enough to have my own villa with plunge pool.    Issues: I checked in and was put in a suite near the children's pool which was noisy. Which is expected. It's a resort that caters to families. I rang and asked to change rooms. Within 2 hours I was moved to a huge private villa. So quiet. Also I lost my camera and the kind security staff found it for me. I felt quite embarrassed:)    The response to the issues raised was so fantastic. It made the stay even more enjoyable.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Kia O wrote a review Jun 2017,30,"5* for the building, 2* service, 3*food",We chose to go to the Four Seasons because a friend recommended it for its pool & kids club. From that point of view we were not disappointed. The building garden pool etc. are beautiful. It is a great place to rest & relax provided that neither service or food bothers you. Service in particular is erratic & bad. All started with a chaotic check-in a few other guests complaining the fact that the 3 times I wanted them to book a restaurant it was a joke they do not pick up the phone at the reception and if they do they will not really book for you. Ahh and in one occasion i wanted them to book a particular place and they told me they advised against my choice because it was not on its 'recommended list' sending us to another one instead. I explained to them that we wanted to eat good food. Their 'recommended place' was certainly not good and we ended up not having main course. So... even that was a failure. Service at their own restaurants is also hit & miss. You may get your food but no cutlery it takes a v long time to get served and do not be surprised if they bring you what you did not order or that they forgot completely about your drinks...the list continues. The Italian restaurant had loud 'rave music'. The food is also hit & miss. Ah... and if you want to leave the hotel be prepared to wait up to 20 mins to get a taxi. They have the grand total of 1 courtesy car for the whole hotel. And it is impossible to walk anywhere. We have been to many Four Seasons around the world mostly because you can rely on having great service and a good experience.

We paid a hefty sum for airport transfers upon arrival because the hotel didn't offer complimentary service. The staff did nothing special for us because it was our honeymoon let alone even say congratulations! We felt pushed aside and disrespected. A luxury resort should know better and offer personalized experiences based on the type of stay...maybe a complimentary honeymoon drink? Hardly!

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Lizz C wrote a review May 2017,20,Disappointed at the quality,We stay at a 4Ss once a year or so we got married in one. We have always left beaming and happy even with the 5-star prices. However this time we felt a bit cheated for 4Ss. Yes it's all relative but for its branding price etc you start to expect above and beyond quality and service. The cons: Check-in was ridiculous. We were not even greeted once we got to the reception as the one person was on the phone and did not even crack a smile. Once we checked-in we went to get lunch as we arrived early 1:30pm. We were told that they would come get us when the room was ready. Mind you I checked-in the day before online so they knew we'd be early. We of course knew that the room may not available until 3 pm as that's the check in time but hoped for an earlier one given the advance notice. Anyway we got lunch and it was 3 pm with nobody coming to us. We did not have a room number to sign the meal to our daughter was annoyed that she could not go into the pool or rest and after a 2 hour drive from the coast we all felt cheated. We asked the restaurant manager to call reception and een after 3 calls could not get a hold of anybody. Finally at 3:30 pm we were taken to our room. Overall calling reception was a pain we would call over 3 times to get a hold of them as nobody would answer. Dine-in service was a joke. They were always late and again this is crucial as we ate in our room often as we did not feel comfortable leaving our daughter asleep. This meant that timing was important. Either we would be left hungry they would ring the bell once she's asleep and the worst was half the meals itself were terrible. DO NOT ORDER PAD THAI. Why would anybody order that in Marrakech you may ask? I'm pregnant so don't ask what my fetus is craving. That's beside the point. It's in the menu it's the 4S I thought it'd be safe. It was awful and it was a stew! Anyway order food with caution as you won't be getting the value. The pros: It is quite perfect for kids. The pool has floating toys smoothies and ice creams (complimentary) are given out and if your kids are old enough the kid's club is nicely set up. The service was nice and good by everybody else aside from the reception.,Date of stay: May 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Dublin, Ireland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LizzC728
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Chilternette wrote a review May 2017,40,Mostly marvellous,Marrakech has a good combination of short flight from London hot enough to swim outside in April and loads of culture. The Four Seasons is nice and the staff friendly and charming but there are a few things that they're still fixing. We were really pleased to find a hotel with decent pool just 10 mins from the airport and the city and we swam every day over Easter. The menus were ok but not exciting though we understand they're revamping them. Having said that the quality of preparation was amazing - the chefs are really talented. Lunches by the pool were especially good.    There are 2 pools one for adults and another for families; the family one has a heated section which is great if you're with small children and can't swim around and there is a kids' club right by the pool - wonderful for parents who need a rest and still want to be near the children. (We didn't use the kids' club so can't comment on its quality.) The adult pool has little tent-style shelters with moveable curtains so you can have sun or shade. We had drinks including tea/coffee brought to us as well as lunch on a lap-tray so we didn't have to leave the pool at all. Late afternoon there was free icecream poolside - a nice surprise.    We had a pavilion room which was close to the pool and had a nice view partly of the hotel and partly of the city roofs beyond. It was a huge room with plenty of space even for our teenager's extra bed and unlike some 3rd beds at hotels it was full size and comfortable. We didn't like the toiletries and regretted not bringing our own. Room service breakfast was good (and 1 continental was enough for 3 of us).    We got totally ignored one meal - couldn't place our order the food didn't come and then the bill didn't come. But the restaurant manager duty manager and hotel manager swung into action and made a lot of effort to make us feel better. We had champagne and macaroons sent in apology and I had a charming email - we felt that we were being listened to.    The wifi is quite good (sometimes you can't get it but the coverage was better than in a lot of hotels we've been to) including at the pool. Reception staff were super-helpful advising us on taxi charges and attractions/restaurants in town.    The gardens are stunning. I went for a walk along the jogging track every morning and the scents of the flowers and the dawn chorus were a joy. Everywhere you go in the hotel there are beautiful and scented plants. The trees are full of birds. We saw butterflies and dragonflies skimming the swimming pool.    So all in all we are confident enough of having a good time here to be looking forward to a return trip. The things that matter are in place (room pool nice staff who knew our names facilities managers really focused on guests). There are hundreds of amazing restaurants a short taxi ride away so if one doesn't like the food one has plenty of choice. And there's so much of Marrakech and beyond to explore.,Date of stay: April 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Henley-on-Thames, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chilternette

The high ceiling and double balcony made it open and airy. So beautiful. We wish we could have spent more time here.

I will say that the security here is top notch so you really feel safe even though I felt safe everywhere in Marrakech. The people are so warm and welcoming. I was really blown away.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,bigblusky10 wrote a review May 2017,30,"Five star name, 3 star experience",We've been lucky enough to stay in some good hotels in recent years in Dubai and elsewhere. When visiting Marrakech we were drawn to the Four Seasons brand name we knew it would be expensive but expected it to deliver a 5 star experience. Sadly this was not the case. It falls short on many levels.    Pros:  - The rooms were kept meticulously clean and we were very impressed with this.  - Pool staff. The pool staff went out of their way to engage with our kids and always had an eye on what was going on in the pool area.  - Free ice creams around the pool in the afternoon.  - The hotel is generous with drinking water.    Cons  - Levels of service. There are two levels of staff. White shirts and those in blue suits. We found that those in white shirts weren't of the standard you'd expect from Four Seasons e.g. when we asked for a glass of wine one guy bought us an empty wine glass. When we asked about where the wine was he just assumed we wanted white. We have too many examples of dodgy service to count here. The guys in the blue suits were amazingly attentive though.  - Variety of meals - There are only really two supper spots here so after two days you've maxed your options out.  - Managing the guests - There were drunk and rowdy guests around the pool who ended up running around the hotel later at night. You'd expect the hotel to intervene but they didn't.  - Bodged booking - Our rooms weren't ready for checkin until after 4pm.  - Quality of room fit - The rooms are of high specification but are dated.  - Wifi - Frustratingly slow.  - Kids club - overly geared to little ones so older kids ended up getting bored.    We spent half the week complaining which was exhausting. We eventually complained to the GM who was receptive and accommodating. If you're considering booking here manage your expectations about value for money. The staff are friendly and everyone does their best but this does not compare to a Dubai hotel.,Date of stay: April 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Bath, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bigblusky10

Our suite was spacious well appointed and more than all the comforts of home. In keeping with the Four Seasons tradition of 'sense of place' this hotel and amenities brought out the best of Moroccan culture and Marrakech hospitality. The most remarkable part of our stay however was the warm friendly and genuine hospitality we received from every member of the staff that we interacted with--from the general manager to the housekeepers-- this was a flawless and gracious stay for us.

The Four Seasons is a great place to relax and escape the busy streets.  Great pools (adults only) services is good. Food ok good gym facilities and I'm sure the spa is good also.    Small things missing like being informed one of the main restaurant was closed and where breakfast was moved to rom services menu no in room.    Found out there is a very handy Four Seasons app but would of been better if I was told about it.

There are several restaurants to choose from and a nice buffet set-up every morning.  The adult pool is a nice touch not having to deal with all the children at certain times of the calendar year.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,SandJG186338 wrote a review Apr 2017,40,Another Great Stay !!,We decided to return to this hotel after having enjoyed it so much last year . We were not disappointed. We were upgraded to a fabulously spacious one bedroom apartment with a huge balcony overlooking the pool and gardens. This is a very pretty property and the gardens are constantly being maintained and tended .  The family pool is where we spent all of our time with our very active seven year old. The feeling and atmosphere is very friendly and the kids very quickly interact and find friends.  The staff are very friendly and helpfulbut we chose always to have lunch in the super Azzera restaurant. Here the food is freshly prepared and to a very high standard. We were never disappointed and I enjoyed many vegetarian inventions from the chef.  In the evenings we tended to eat at Inara and enjoy the view from the terrace over the gardens and ornamental pools. The service was mainly very good although sometimes a little slow but the waiters are never short of a smile especially Moosa who was particularly friendly and great with my daughter and her little friends. What was also a great improvement was the introduction of live entertainment. This is largely background music provided by two fabulous guitarist/ singers and a Russian Jazz singer playing a wide variety of Spanish classical music through to jazz and popular covers.For me this made a massive difference. We ate in the Italian restaurant which was superb. I like others would love a permanent extra eating option and the upper terrace on the top of 'Bleu d'orange would be a lovely place to have cocktails and tapas style food.  My husband was impressed with the gym and used it daily.The rooms were serviced beautifully and we found all of the staff to be very helpful and polite .The Manger Blaise was very present and introduced himself . He was very friendly and keen to know how our stay was going and whether there was anything he could help us with. I have a feeling that this hotel will continue to iron out any problems and continue to strive to provide a top quality experience.Having totally relaxed and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves for the second year running I suspect that an annual visit here could definitely be on the cards.,Date of stay: April 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SandJG186338

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,seattlemougins wrote a review Apr 2017,40,"Good hotel but a ""B"" for Four Seasons",We have been here for the last week. Nice complex good location. Reasonable food prices (for a 4S). Housekeeping excellent. Internet is good. A/C is good. Rooms are spacious and well-designed.    Lots of small problems though that indicate this place is not well managed. Some examples - first night we had to ask three times for crayons for our kids at dinner several times it took extremely long for simple things like coffee or tea to arrive at breakfast lots of the silverware in the restaurants is bent and/or has dried food on it often when we call the front desk or concierge there is simply no answer (at other 4S hotels it always transfers the call to the operator). Our bed is quite worn out has big depressions in it. The restaurants really struggle when they are more than half full. There are lots of employees but they don't have good operational systems so the service drops quickly. Lots of workers on site claim to speak English but don't really so we frequently had language barrier issues. Kids club not really staffed all day like at other 4S locations.    One bright note was Kacem a server at the pool bar. Like many folks at other 4S hotels he really put out an effort to get to know us and customize the service.    We may come back here but after having lunch at the Mandarin where the food and service were much better we think we will try that or the Mamounia next time.,Date of stay: April 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Seattle, Washington",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seattlemougins
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,dmctravels wrote a review Apr 2017,50,A Great Experience,Having been here briefly once before the family were unanimous about where to stay for a five night Easter break. Overall we had a great experience. The grounds are secure substantial and very well maintained. The pool area is beautiful and doesn't feel too busy. The staff make this resort. They are well trained efficient plentiful and very friendly. The rooms are excellent although just beginning to show the tiniest bit of wear and tear. If there is a disappointment it is that the resort could do with more restaurant options as the evening is limited to two. A temporary solution is in place during renovation of one of them but even after reopening there will still only be two. They are good and family friendly but I feel a hotel of this size and standard needs a proper third option.,Date of stay: April 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Oxford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dmctravels2016
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Juckles wrote a review Apr 2017,50,Easter Holidays,We've just returned from a 10 night trip staying at Four Seasons throughout. We've been Dubai visitors in the 3 preceding years during the Easter holidays. Last year we felt the cost of Dubai had become ridiculous and that was before Brexit hammered the pound further. So we looked for somewhere offering Easter sun quality accommodation easy flights but less extortionate.    Marrakesh and Four Seasons was what we chose. Going into the holiday I was nervous that despite it costing less than 50% of our previous Dubai trips we'd made a mistake. Holidays with our young kids are precious as these years will be passed in a flash and I don't want to mess any of them up.    I shouldn't have worried at all. It was an absolutely superb holiday. Easy flights from London no jet lag no time difference hotel 15 minutes from airport. People of Morocco incredibly nice welcoming and very keen to encourage tourists as they recognise how important it is to the economy. Marrakesh for the most part very pretty and outside of the city when you go into the mountains it is exceptionally beautiful.    With respect to the hotel I agree with all the positive comments you can find in other reviews. I have very few negative impressions - more on site dinner options would be great but that would stop you venturing out so much which would have been a great shame. Once in Marrakesh you do not feel at all unsafe with the possible exception of the Jemaa el-Fnaa famous square. My advice is don't bother with it - it's just a horrid tourist trap with animal cruelty on show and constant pestering from merchants. If you go to the mountains you can find all the same stuff on sale in far prettier and far less aggressive environments and without monkeys on neck chains and snakes being thrust onto your children without asking.    There are endless restaurant choices across the city; it can be a bit hit or miss on quality and service but that's in part my own fault for not properly looking into it in advance. The two restaurants at the hotel are excellent.    The four seasons family swimming pool is superb for the children. The pictures on the web site make it look very pretty and well designed but a little austere. When you're there and its full of kids playing with one another and with the excellent kids club staff its a very different area all together and better for it. One half of it is unheated and not surprisingly isn't used as much. Perhaps they should heat it too if only is it gets used a bit more.    Lifeguard wise around the the pool it is safe enough and adequately monitored such that you relax. Where we stayed in Dubai it was too but excessively so where the lifeguards stopped even the lightest of horseplay amongst the kids. At the 4 season they let the children play and jump in and mess around and that made for so much more fun for them. Ayoub is a fantastic lifeguard and amazing at entertaining the kids. Service round the pool from Rachid & Marouane is fantastic.    Nothing is too much trouble for the staff at the 4 seasons and we are intending returning next year at the same time.,Date of stay: April 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Juckles

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Travelking997 wrote a review Apr 2017,50,As expected !,I sometimes wish there was a sixth star or a half star to use on the tripadvisor rating. This hotel is a good case in point  compared with other hotels ive been lucky enough to stay in  it shouldn't rate as high as some of them but giving it less than a five wouldnt be fair as the hotel is pretty good. The grounds and staff are lovely. The hotel is about 5/6 years old and our room was looking a little little bit tired not really a problem at the moment but could be if furnishings are not kept an eye on. For me a true judge of a hotel is would i go back to it and i would. The position is very good being quite close to the Medina and really close to the airport . When i first started staying at Four Seasons properties many years ago they were heads and shoulders above the rest. I feel that many hotels have now overtaken them  maybe not in service but room technology has really moved on with sophisticated AV  lighting and other conveniences  not a pop here just more an observation.,Date of stay: April 2017,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travelking997

They come round with complimentary ice creams and smoothies during the day. The kids club was also amazing and staffed with professionals.  For the adults there was a gorgeous spa where I had a great massage. The food at the resort is good and there is also an adult pool away from the noise.  The hotel dealt with a minor allergy incident with my daughter (my fault not the hotels) and were excellent throughout the trip - I can't thank them enough.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,LondonBanker wrote a review Apr 2017,40,Great service,This clearly is a super popular resort (full over the week before Easter 2017) with a well heeled clientele. I had stayed at Amanjena once before.    I had a bad trip getting there (15 hours rather than the planned 5) and my luggage was lost and in the event didn't turn up for 3 days. The hotel staff led by the Head Concierge Ghita recognised my plight and that I wasn't so happy on the first day and they went out of their way to help me. It felt to me like they had assigned staff around the hotel to make sure I had a great time throughout my stay (e.g. they all knew my name) which they succeeded in doing.    I stayed in a one bedroom suite which is very large inside and out and well appointed. The only point I would note given I was travelling solo is that my room faced out onto the children's pool so it had consequent noise during the day. I personally spent my time during the day when I was there at the adult's only pool. The flip side of this is that overall it appeared to me to be a very family friendly place.    As an experience I strongly recommend a trip to the Atlas Mountains. I took a drive in a Range Rover with a chap from the hotels's recommended car service named Sabre and he took me on a tour of a Berber village and then up to the Mountains to meet a local guide nicknamed Obama as he looks like the former American President. A walk on the rough trail up to the waterfall at the top is both challenging and rewarding not for the faint-hearted. Sabre also took me to his mother' house in the town at the end of the walk to see how the locals live which was very interesting.    Finally the hotel has one of the best Spa's I have seen anywhere both aesthetically and also in terms of the treatments offered.,Date of stay: April 2017,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LondonBanker

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,486luluf wrote a review Apr 2017,50,Wonderful stay with family,We have just returned from a wonderful five night stay at the Four Seasons with two of our three girls (4yrs and 13yrs).

The dining options were great and the atmosphere at the hotel was relaxed for guests ie not too formal despite the luxury nature of the hotel. Free snacks around the pool during the day were a lovely touch. The only thing I would recommend is that if you want to go on day trips tours to the medina you will need to ask as there is no literature in the rooms about what you could do while in Marrakech and no mention about things to do outside the hotel. We made our own arrangements to go to the mountains and zip wiring. Kids club was great - well stocked with games and activities.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,J migd wrote a review Mar 2017,50,Impeccable,Impeccable. Can not fault in any way. Everyone went the extra mile to make my birthday stay 5* and memorable. The grounds are beautifully landscaped and the pools beautiful. It was a delight to sit on the veranda and just admire the grounds. Despite being fully booked the hotel manages to achieve privacy through its clever design and great use of tree planting. The staff at the four seasons are super nice and friendly and were a delight to always deal with. The staff made our stay even more special. Highly recommend and will definitely return.,Date of stay: March 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jmigd
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,TGIF103 wrote a review Mar 2017,50,"""If you don't leave, you can't come back!""","My Aunt used to always say ""If you don't leave you can't come back"" to my young daughter when after an action-packed visit she didn't want to go home. Well after a recent week-long action-packed stay at the lovely Four Seasons Resort Marrakech my wife (now older) daughter and I did not want to leave! And we definitely want to come back!    You know a resort has been a success when you are sad to depart not just because you will miss the beautiful setting the relaxing room and the fantastic food but also because you feel as if many members of the staff have become personal friends! That was the case for us. We were particularly impressed with the front desk and concierge staff -- including Badr Salma Safia and others -- who took care of every request promptly accurately and with good cheer. Likewise the food and beverage team responded to my wife's special dietary needs with professionalism and a genuine interest in her well-being. We owe a particular debt of gratitude to Chef Marco in the main restaurant who came out each night to greet my wife personally and then prepared a different dish and dessert based on the limited list of ingredients that are safe for her to eat. As a result dinner became an eagerly anticipated event each day!    A few more highlights of our stay:    We took two day trips arranged by the hotel -- first to Essaouira on the Atlantic Ocean which was a nice change of scenery and then up through the Atlas Mountains to visit Ouarzazate and the ancient kasbah at Ait Ben Haddou which was simply incredible. Charaf -- our driver/guide on the 4-hour-each-way drive to Ouarzazate -- was an expert driver a knowledgeable guide and great companion for the day.    We stayed in a two-bedroom villa with private plunge pool. It was a splurge but very spacious beautifully decorated and very serene. My only minor complaint is that the huge outdoor patio is not as private as might be expected.    We made multiple visits to the Medina and newer sections of Marrakech and the location of the resort could not have been more central and convenient. Everything was within range of a ten to fifteen minute taxi ride including the international airport.    We usually stay in Four Season hotels and resorts when we travel because we know the service facilities and food will be exceptional. That was certainly the case in Marrakech. We were very sad to leave but we will come back!",Date of stay: March 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Greenwich, Connecticut",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TGIF103
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,kenzayka wrote a review Mar 2017,20,Worst service ever experienced at a four seasons hotel,I was excited to stay at this hotel as it was a brand that I knew and loved for it's excellent standards however having booked a short 4 day visit I ended up experiencing such a stressful week having to demand the bare minimum from this hotel. First off the A/C in my room was so weak that it was practically boiling in my room it took them 2 days to fix it . Secondly I demanded a four season driver with a Mercedes to drive me to dinner golf ect...the driver would negotiate with me a time to come pick me up instead of actually waiting for me to be done ( and I specifically asked for the package where the driver stays with me all night) then he ended up being 25 mins late ! And this is supposed to be a premium service. Another issue was there were a few things in the room service menu that were missing for example the fois gras. Also I have always been used to hotels calling me when there was an issue however this hotel whenever there was a problem they would avoid calling me and would assume otherwise for example I was expecting a friend and she kindly went to the reception to be guided to my room or to the restaurant instead they attacked her and treated her as if she was a criminal for wanting to know where my room was and the problem is instead of calling me and asking me if I'm expecting a friend they just ignored her and left her in tears and I had to rush down to look for her. Horrible service definitely not a relaxing stay and will sadly choose an alternate 5 star hotel.,Date of stay: March 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Muscat, Oman",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kenzayka

Concerns about language barriers or safety in Morrocco are way over blown. The Moroccan people are kind and thoughtful. The Four Seasons is a great home base - close to the Medina and other interesting tourists destinations. We highly recommend Blue Orange the restraunt by the pool - ask for El Habib and his recommendations for food and wine - you will not be disappointed. My wife and daughters enjoyed the spa services.

Staff were extremely friendly and helpful but not over the top. Genuinely nice people with no agenda. I.e only after good tips. Shopping mall cafes and restaurants a short 10 minutes walk away. We are out most nights as we found the hotel restaurant lacking in choice. We did however eat there one night and the food was traditionally Moroccan and very tasty. Smaller resort than where I have stayed in the past ( Kenzi manara resort ).

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Alli D wrote a review Mar 2017,40,"Gets the small details right, but sometimes misses the bigger picture",We have just returned from a wonderful stay at the Four Seasons - the room (Upper Pavilion) was large and roomy with a huge bed and the bathroom had the deepest bath I've seen. The terrace was beautiful and had table and chairs as well as Sun loungers and a lovely shady nook area. My one complaint was that I returned to the room at 2pm one afternoon and the room hadn't been cleaned. A quick call to housekeeping though and they sent someone immediately. The staff are friendly and will greet you with a smile as well as helping out - nothing is too much trouble for example I'd left a book by the side of the bed and when I returned a bookmark had been placed there and whenever we went outside the hotel we were given a bottle of water. It's these little things that make all the difference.  The food choice in the restaurants was a little small - one of the restaurants on the property was closed during our stay and being a taxi drive away from the Medina meant that there was a limited choice in an evening. There was also a limited choice for snacks during the day although when drinks were ordered they did come with small bowls of nuts and pitta chips. The food though is a good quality and was enjoyable.  The adult pool area is lovely and again the details such as iced water and small complimentary juices bought to the loungers are very welcome as well as the staff moving loungers and parasols to suit meant that a lazy day by the pool is exactly that.  The breakfast has a choice of buffet or a la carte - I can't comment on the a la carte but the buffet had a good choice of hot and cold dishes and breads with omelettes and fried eggs made to order. Unlimited orange juice and coffee is available and very good. My one complaint however is that the waiters forgot requests for additional coffee and juice as they seemed to cover all tables rather than concentrate on specific sections so this meant that we occasionally had two waiters turn up with the refills. This is the reason for only 4 stars rather than 5 as with a little more effort and organisation this issue could be resolved.  We did have the hotel organise a guide to take us around the Medina Bahia Palace and the Madrassa - this was a half day trip with Aziz who gave a detailed trip around the old city and the souks. It was a little expensive but we did see areas of the Medina that we probably wouldn't have seen without his guidance and he recommended a lovely restaurant for our lunch.  It was a great trip overall and the resort does get the small things right but does need to work on the breakfast service especially.,Date of stay: March 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Cardiff, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/allid706

From the reception security and all the restaurant and pool staff we were treated so well in every exchange. Our three children thoroughly enjoyed hanging out in the teen center and of course playing by the pool. Two of the restaurants were being refurbished during our stay so we stuck to pool service for lunch room service and the Italian restaurant for dinner all I highly recommend.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Mmejetsetter F wrote a review Feb 2017,50,Magnificent Resort!!!,Stayed at Four seasons Marrakech and was blown away by the resort!    We were welcomed and assisted by the guest services team. Upon check in we were given a traditional mint tea. Samia (not quite sure her name) at the reception succeeded our expectation by giving us GREAT room. Her gesture was truly appreciated!    We love the modern Moroccan architecture of the hotel and the room. It was made with exquisite taste.    The resort is about 5-10mins away from the airport and close to every tourist spots.    The spa facility was relaxing. The massage was good but I noticed a tiny changes in terms of their standards. The therapist was very adorable and did a great job as I asked for full & hard massage however I felt that there was something missing.. the ambiance and the typical ritual was quite different from the last time. On the other hand my daughter enjoyed her treatment. Her therapist was so accommodating and took care of her very well.    Our children absolutely enjoyed the kids club and the heated pool! The staff at the kids club and the recreation manager are all helpful and amazing with the kids! Big thanks to Nabila Samira Mehdi & the other lovely lady whom I forgot the name.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Stephen O wrote a review Feb 2017,50,Four seasons Marrakech,Probably the most exclusive family resort in Marrakech the Four Seasons offers luxury amid 40 acres of landscaped Moorish gardens.  Located on the edge of Hivernage overlooking the royal Menara Gardens the Four Seasons is a 10-minute drive and a 25-minute walk west of the medina.  The highlight of the resort are the luxurious guestrooms and suites of which there are 141 dotted around the gardens in large multi-room ‘pavilions’. All of them have private balconies with sun loungers set towards views of the Atlas Mountains.  Between the three restaurants – Solano Bleu d’Orange and the Azzera Pool Grill – and two bars you can sample a bewildering array of well-executed world cuisine ranging from a sumptuous Moroccan buffet to à la carte Italian and French fine dining and American-style burghers and salads.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,mustbefivestar wrote a review Feb 2017,40,A few things to change,I thought long and hard about this review because up until checkout we had a lovely stay with only one or two minor things that I would comment on. Checkout however was a disaster and this very nearly became a one star review as a result More of that below. The resort itself is nicely laid out on the outskirts of Marrakech quiet and peaceful apart from the occasional plane overhead. It is a little sprawling. Our suite was not in the main building and there was therefore a bit of a trek from one place to the next. This will be annoying when it is really hot but also when it is raining as it was when we were there. It was a 4-5 minute walk up to reception and this had to be completed outdoors. Compensating for this and the reason for the 4 star review is that the rooms are spacious and beautifully clean as you would expect of Four Seasons. Service charming breakfast buffet excellent and the spa and fitness facilities top notch. The pool areas are huge and there is a separate adult only and family pool which gives people greater choice. On the whole I would therefore recommend and we would probably stay again. On checkout there was an issue in relation to the package we had booked. We had booked a spa package which was advertised as including a 50 minute massage per day. On checkout they tried to argue that this was for only one person which would be the most bizarre offer when you are booking a double room. In any event I had confirmed all of this beforehand so had the e-mails to prove what had been agreed. This all took 20 minutes and was not without a certain beligerance from the reception staff. There were other errors on the bill such as trying to charge 3 times for our airport transfers. It was annoying and very much spoilt the last day of our break. I also found that communication with the concierge prior to arrival was more difficult than it should have been having to double check that things had been done. And there is a hotel car shuttle service into town in the evening but it is one car and availability seems to be non-existent unless you are prepared to wait for long periods.,Date of stay: February 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mustbefivestar

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Martin wrote a review Feb 2017,50,A place well worth visiting,"15 to 20 years ago Marrakech was a city for the more adventurous traveller. People would return from this mystical city with tales of being harassed and harangued at every turn of a street corner. Talk of children being dragged into shops so parents would follow were everyday occurrences and the best option for accommodation was something with a heavy duty lock on the door...    But things have changed... And Marrakech (in fact Morocco in general it seems) have woken up to the vast income there is to be had from tourism it is no longer a place to fear or worry about it is now a place to explore and become involved in.    For the more adventurous traveller Marrakech may well have lost some of its charm as you no longer need a good grasp of Arabic or French a sturdy back pack the map reading agility of a cartographer and the cunning of a fox to get yourself around the city but on the other side of the coin it has made the city much more accessible to the average tourist... I firmly put myself in that bracket!    With the income from tourism it's clear to see the changes whilst the old city and main square remain largely untouched newer developments are springing up all over and shops like Louis Vuitton and nightclubs like Buddha Bar can easily be found a 10 minute taxi ride from the old town. Indeed don't be surprised by shiny new Mercedes and Audi's driving past you there is an air of money around the suburbs.    The type of accommodation here is vast. Everything from the basic Riad to the very upmarket La Mamounia Palace which was the favourite place to stay for Winston Churchill and still has a bar bearing his name... A favourite haunt for celebs whilst filming in Marrakech and the place to have a suite... If of course you have a spare £6000+ per night.    Unfortunately La Mamounia was a little out of our price range but that's ok I booked using British Airways holidays and enjoyed 4 nights in the City!    A couple of facts to note first. On arrival into Menara (the airport at Marrakech) I was stunned by the lovely new airport terminal. Having flown to places like this before I had my sights firmly set on walking across the tarmac to a small building with a couple of unfriendly guards but no another sign of its new love of tourism is the shiny new terminal complete with air conditioning full passport control and open spaces for you to wait for your luggage which arrived promptly. On the return leg only a small queue for security and a comfortable waiting area with some duty free shops awaited us a point to note here is that the vast majority of duty free shops only accept Euros not Moroccan Dirhams so don’t think you can spend you left over currency at the airport.    Drivers and waiting relatives are not allowed into the terminal building they have to wait outside so you will have to exit the terminal in order to find your airport transfer but again I was not approached once by anyone trying to grab my bags or push me into a taxi there was an order to the numbers waiting outside and we easily found our transfer who arrived 5 minutes after we had stepped outside the building (even he was caught out by our flight arriving a little early). A tip here is to make sure you do book a transfer although a little more expensive than a local taxi after a flight its always nice to just be picked up and whisked off to your hotel. Again I booked ours via BA to the tune of £22. However do be aware that if you are staying in the old town (Medina) part of Marrakech a lot of the streets are too narrow to fit a car down so you may end up walking part of the way and having a good map and a light suitcase will be a big help!    If you do get a local taxi then you need to remember 2 things. Make sure you tell them exactly where you want to go and I mean by street name or hotel name and set the price with them before setting off. Very important to remember this as there are some drivers who won't use a meter and then charge you a silly price at the end of your journey. From the airport to the Medina should cost around 50-60 MAD (about £5-£6).    Interestingly enough the old town has building regulations much like we do in England so all the Riad's and homes have to be the same colour they also cannot put anything on the outside of the buildings so that you can see how wealthy a person is therefore poor moderate or wealthy all the buildings look the same from the outside so don't be alarmed if you pull up outside a Riad that doesn't look like the photos in the brochure. Once you step through the door the difference is quickly established. We were lucky enough to be shown inside two Riads and once through the door an open courtyard greeted us with a small pool bathed in sunshine. Smart and clean rooms were set around the main courtyard and a full range of facilities was on offer. Most Riad's have between 5 and 15 rooms and were former palaces or wealthy homes so a conversion into a hotel didn't take too much but the facilities on offer do vary so make sure you check and scour around for one that suits your needs (not all of them serve alcohol for example). Whilst on the subject of accommodation that leads me nicely to ours the Four Seasons Resort and Private Residences.    The resort itself is a 15 / 20 minute car ride from the Airport and sits about 15 minutes away from the old town of Marrakech. It's facilities include 2 restaurants one Italian and one Moroccan / Mediterranean (with outside and indoor seating) It has a bar 24 hour room service 2 pools one for families and one for adults a spa (although you need to note that women and men cannot use the same spa facilities so there are separate saunas and jacuzzis etc) a spacious lounge tennis courts and a pool side restaurant and bar. There is free WIFI across the resort you can pay to upgrade to a faster connection but in all honesty I streamed movies and did all the usual social media using the standard connection.    Firstly let's get prices out of the way. If you don't have breakfast included then it can be quite costly. A breakfast is 350 MAD per person (approx £31). As for drinks well a bottle of local beer will set you back 90 MAD (approx £8) and a Grey Goose vodka with lime and soda 180 MAD (approx £16). On average dinner for 2 is around 1000 MAD (approx £90) without wine you can easily add on an additional 800 MAD (approx £72) if you do have wine. But that said it is certainly no more than dinner out in London would be and Four Seasons do have a reputation for good food and service and this is no different.    Upon arrival to the hotel we were greeted and shown around before being taken to the room. When we got there our luggage had been already placed in the room and we were made to feel very welcome.    So the room. We had a Garden Terrace room which I have to say was huge. A king size bed sitting area private outdoor terrace with sun loungers and a bathroom that could accommodate a football team were standard. The bath could easily double as a children's plunge pool and the shower came with all the usual nice shower gels and shampoo etc. A hairdryer bath robes and slippers are also in the room as standard along with bottles of water and a minibar. The water is free the minibar is not. A turn down service is given every night and the room is fully air conditioned. There is also a walk-in wardrobe if you happen to travel with a little more luggage!    We ate 3 times in the hotel twice in the Moroccan and once in the Italian restaurant and all 3 times were impressed. The food is well presented tasty and we were not rushed at all do try the Tagine and the fresh bread that comes with every meal. Drinks in the bar were very pleasant and the outdoor seating area means that breakfast in the morning can be taken on the terrace of the Italian restaurant with the sun beating down... A great way to start your day and the buffet at breakfast caters for everyone. Pancakes omelettes cooked breakfast fresh fruit salmon pastries you name it its on it!    February is low season in Marrakech but the weather we had (all 4 days were beautifully sunny and reached mid twenties during the day) meant we tried the pool facilities which again were lovely. The family pool was closed (due to low season) but to be honest there was more than enough space around the adult pool to accommodate everyone and fresh pool towels are readily available along with service from the pool bar which included some nice touches of a fresh fruit skewer iced water orange sorbet and a chocolate milkshake shot all delivered free to everyone at different points throughout the day.    A point to note on the weather is that whilst it is warm and sunny during the day because of Marrakech being on the border of the Sahara desert and at the foot of the Atlas Mountains it will go cold at night. So at this time of year you get 23-27 degrees in the day and then 7-12 degrees at night so make sure you bring warmer clothing for the evening. The dress code seemed to be smart casual for dinner shorts and T-Shirts for breakfast.    The service. In a word superb. We were made to feel very welcome from check-in to check-out. Nothing was too much trouble everything was accompanied by ""you're most welcome"" even by the pool we were shown to our sun beds given towels approached by the waiter with ice-cold water made to feel like our comfort was their top priority. During dinner the service was again slick but not over bearing and everyone we met from the doorman to the housekeeping staff said good morning and welcomed us back from our days out. It just felt like a Four Seasons should do polite friendly and a team of staff on top of their game.    The hotel itself is clearly looked after I tried to find fault looked for the cracked tile in the bathroom etc but I couldn't find it. All the public areas were scrupulously clean and even though it was low season with the exception of the family pool everything was open. There were enough staff on all the time and with it being set in nice grounds the whole place felt like an oasis.    The hotel can also arrange day trips for you but we did ours via Holiday Taxis who arranged our transfer. We toured the souks and palaces of the Medina and also ate out just off the main square one evening. I would highly recommend a guide whilst you do the tour not to stop you being pestered (we only got briefly approached twice during our half day) but because there is a lot of history in Marrakech and without a guide you would easily miss most of it. Walking around some of the monuments and palaces there aren't a lot of signs describing what the place is or does and those signs that are around can often be in French and Arabic only so having a guide gave us a much better view of the city. Whilst walking around it is easy to see why people can get lost but there are now signs about the City pointing you in the direction of the main square where snake charmers and food stalls can be found a plenty. The best time to walk round the city is between 9-3pm between 3pm-6pm it can become very busy and with the heat especially in the mid summer a little uncomfortable. That said at 10am it is quiet and very pleasant to walk through again having a guide gives you so much more of a better understanding and ours spoke very good English.    The evening time bought a different vibe and during our horse and carriage ride around the city walls it was clear to see the new money coming out to play but again the Medina keeps its charm and becomes a mecca for people watching the sun go down at the roof top bar of the Cafe de France or going out to sample some of the local delicacies.    Other trips you can do (although we didn't partake) include a day out to the Atlas Mountains or Camel Trekking or to visiting the film sets of Gladiator Game of Thrones and Lawrence of Arabia but again if you are coming in low season you can pretty much make your own itinerary someone will accommodate it!    Would I come to Marrakech again? You bet. The city is great and you don't need a huge amount of time so it is perfect for the 3-4 day getaway. Some winter sun is always welcome and if you are staying at the Four Seasons you can easily loose track of time lounging by the pool we certainly did but the main difference is the fear factor is no longer here this came across as a City that knows where it's money lies and frightened tourists seem to be a thing of the past. I can only go on my experiences with my other half (we didn't travel with children) and those experiences were ones of a friendly welcoming city where lots of people speak very good English and where you can loose yourself for a few days. In the whole time we were here we never once felt like it was a dangerous place to be.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,strangest_travel wrote a review Jan 2017,50,"Marrakech Four Seasons ""Active"" Itinerary",We had three rooms for seven of us including five teens. The Four Seasons resort is a lovely oasis with fine dining and everything a traveler would expect from a FS property. While it's a little removed from the central tourist area of Marrakech the best sights are actually outside of town making the Four Seasons' location ideal for those seeking an active itinerary.    Day 1: Hot Air Balloon and Souk. Start your first morning with a hot air balloon ride floating over the foothills of the Atlas Mountains. After lunch take a guided tour of the old town including Jemaa El Fna Square and its snake charmers. Photo Tip: Jemaa El Fna Square. Pose with the local dancers in their costumes at the entrance to the square; pose with the snake charmers holding a charmed cobra around your neck.    Day 2: The Sahara. Hire a Four Seasons driver to go over the Atlas mountains and descend into the Sahara. Lunch in Ouarzazate and then travel on to the ancient fort and World Heritage Site of Ait Benhaddou. Climb through the earth and clay towers of six Kasbahs and fifty palaces. You’ll instantly recognize it as a setting used for Game of Thrones Prince of Persia Alexander and Sheltering Sky among others. Photo Tip: at the overlook approaching Ait Benhaddou with the ancient city in the distance behind you.    Day 3: Ourika Valley. Hire a Four Seasons driver and spend the day in the Ourika Valley. Take your time and hike up the seven waterfalls of Seti Fatma and visit a Berber home.    Day 4: Morning: Camel Ride in La Palmeraie. Ride your camel around the palm plantation. Photo: Sitting on your camels and surrounded by palm trees. Afternoon: Churchill’s Marrakesh starting with lunch at La Mamounia Hotel where Winston Churchill often visited proclaiming “It is the most lovely spot in the whole world.” Then stroll through its gardens.    Day 5: Shopping in the Souk. Buy local clothes smaller carpets and the lovely ceramic vases (that you can carry back yourself). Afterwards spend your last afternoon lounging around the Four Seasons' pool.,Date of stay: December 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Houston, Texas",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/strangest_travel

The rooms are beautiful very spacious and extremely well-appointed. The bathrooms are also huge with plenty of counter space large rain showers and tubs. There were also two large terrace areas - one with chaise lounges and the other with chairs and recessed seating. The grounds are extensive and lush - it truly feels like a resort and not just a hotel. There is both an adult pool and a kids pool. The al fresco pool restaurant adjacent to the adult pool has a great menu - it was actually one of our favorite meals. The staff are truly wonderful - Salma was incredibly helpful in arranging airport transfer setting us up with a very experienced guide for a tour of Marrakech including the medina and souks and recommending and booking several dinner reservations. Everyone we encountered was gracious and truly attentive to every detail.    The spa is also outstanding - we tried the Hammam Ritual - what an experience! We also ate several times in the Inara bar - the traditional Moroccan food was very well prepared and Hajar was our server on every occasion - she was terrific!

So I'm going to keep this short and sweet and try to hit the main highlights of this hotel that impressed us.    First off - the grounds are gorgeous. The lush flora fountains and several pools are all set upon the backdrop of the mountains. Stunning.    The rooms were huge and appointed with every luxury and amenity imaginable.    The staff was extremely friendly. Especially family friendly. My kids played in the pool and when I apologized to the pool staff for them being a bit loud they said not to worry - this was the family pool and pointed out that the adults had their own pool - so play away!    Our kids found a few others from the United States and England to play with and they had fun playing with the balls and floaty toys provided by the hotel.    The food- we had a buffet that was set to break the Ramadan fast at the end of the day and it was bigger than you could imagine. I loved all the vegetarian options! So grateful for that being a vegetarian.    The entertainment during dinner was so fun. Genuinely Moroccan with unique horns percussion and string instruments.    We also were grateful to the concierge that set up a pick up at airport as well as a private guide that toured us through many historical points as well as through the maze of the medina.    Prior to booking here I really struggled with which location to pick for a hotel. I knew we wanted to go 5 star but also considered a few hotels within walking distance of the Medina.    I'm really glad we picked this hotel The Four Seasons for so many reasons!    The security was over the top. Behind a gated entry with guard for entrance with the car and then additional personal security detection gates at the entry.    Everything here was top notch. Housekeeping concierge front desk bell man in fact we were walked to our room to check in rather than waiting at the front.    Lovely all around.

We also had a very nice private outdoor garden area just outside our room with loungers and table and chairs. There was a gate we could exit from to walk around to the pool. The staff was very friendly and quite attentive. Everyone truly was focussed on delivering an amazing experience for us.

Celebrating our Wedding Anniversary we were upgraded to a Pool Suite the room was perfect 2 bathrooms 2 dressing rooms a living area and a four poster (room 121). Truly amazing and I've not mentioned the plunge pool and private terrace.    We ate the first night of our 3 night stay in the international restaurant at the hotel fantastic food and amazing service. The service was impeccable everywhere in the hotel and everyone we met had such enthusiasm for their role.    The hotel is spacious with 2 pools sunbeds nicely spaced out for relaxing after the experience that is the Medina!.    Breakfast was plentiful with lots of choice. Happy Anniversary cakes were waiting on a table - a lovely gesture.    Taxi from the hotel to the for a pre booked ""Walking Tour of the Medina"" (see that update if you're looking for a good trip). Less than 10 mins to the main square and around 50 Dir depending how good you barter. (under £5)    Some 5 hours later back at the pool having learnt a lot walked a lot and shopped a lot. The pool was cool the attendants attentive cold drinks ice cream melon olives all served free of charge and at regular intervals.    Saturday evening saw us dining at Maison MK (see that update fabulous roof terrace). upon returning to our room a bottle of Prosecco and chocolate cake awaited us.    I've stayed in many hotels all over the world and this hotel has something special. The style décor the commitment to customer service are all significant in creating our wonderful experience.    Staying outside the Medina was the right choice for us giving us an escape from the noisy but magical Medina and it's enticing souks.

After finding the Four Seasons rather disappointing in 2015 I was very pleasantly surprised by the improvements in staff attention to detail customer satisfaction and the overall welcome I felt throughout my stay.  Most notable among the staff was Abdessamed Akhmassi my driver. He drove both my Wife and I to various locations in and around Marrakech and acted as an informed and knowledgeable tour guide to my Wife during my business meetings.  The head concierge Ghita Kamal was also extremely helpful in many ways and nothing appeared to be too much trouble for her. She always appeared professional and competent and never lost that lovely welcoming smile. Truly an asset to the hotel.  My group ate at all of the hotels restaurants on several occasions. The poolside terrace restaurant ""Azzera"" was our favorite. Welcoming staff and prompt service. No mean feat when you have a hotel full of other hoteliers travel agents and tour operators from around the World on a tight schedule.  Our suite was very spacious as was the lovely bathroom. Nice balcony with pleasant private and quiet view out over the gardens.    Good job to all.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,mindythelion wrote a review Oct 2016,50,Perfect resort to explore the magic of Marrakech,We stayed at this Four Seasons property in September 2016 and couldn't have asked for a better place to experience the bustling city of Marrakech.    Because it's only 10 minutes drive outside the main medina and 5-10 minutes from the airport the location of this hotel could not be better especially to use as a home base for visiting the souks and hectic market square. What makes this FS property an ideal place to stay however is that the 40-acre resort becomes your quiet and luxurious sanctuary the minute you return a calm oasis to relax by the pool have a workout or enjoy the spa. If you're into yoga ask for a session with Manoj the resident instructor who was born and raised in Rishikesh - the yoga capital of the world.    We spent a good portion of our stay working on our laptops and I'm happy to say that there are several areas around the resort that are convenient to work in the wifi is quite good and the constant service of Moroccan mint tea and small treats is an added bonus that makes the time 'in office' much more enjoyable. When we weren't on our computers we were shopping in the souks and one of the amazing offers that Four Seasons presents is the ability to ship your newfound treasures home so you can say yes to that intricate brass lamp and the camel bone tea set without worrying about your return-flight baggage weight :)    All-in-all the experience was everything we hoped for from a five-star Four Seasons property: refined professionalism an inviting ambiance and delicious food with natural beauty all around. Be sure to take in the sprawling view from the Inara lounge terrace... and for a real Moroccan treat experience it with flavoured shisha in hand!,Date of stay: October 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Vancouver, BC",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mindythelion
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Filip N wrote a review Oct 2016,50,Everything you would expect from a four seasons hotel. Super.,Very nice hotel with super friendly staff from the reception right to the pool staff. Ideal to relax especially at the adults only pool (there is also a family pool on the other side). Very nice rooms with very comfortable bed and pillows. The concierge was very helpful in recommending restaurants in Marrakech. We also used the courtesy car that the hotel kept available every night from 18.00 to 22.00hrs on a first come-first serve basis. We often had lunch at the pool side restaurant and the food was excellent. In the evening there was the restaurant in the lobby area. We actually only had drinks there as in our opinion you didn't really get an experience of going out and being in a separate restaurant. So an extra restaurant would have been nice. This is an ideal hotel if you want to discover Marrakech. Everything was perfect except for 1 thing : during the day there were construction works in the villas near the adult pool and at times that was rather disturbing.,Date of stay: October 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Knokke, Belgium",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/filipn2014
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,JPAP-SHLC wrote a review Oct 2016,30,Poor Aspects and Very Good Aspects,"We visited this hotel a year ago and it became one of our favourite four seasons resorts. There have been some changes - some good some bad - since we last visited (when we gave the hotel 5/5) but the resounding issue was a huge drop in quality of service in the food and beverage outlets.    My only complaint on our first visit was that the wifi was poor with no reception around the pool. They have clearly fixed this and I didn't even need to bother with the premium wifi we got with our suite and just used the complimentary wifi the whole time.    Turning to the issues they have switched up their restaurants to remove their only good restaurant and the service at breakfast lunch and dinner was very very poor.    Firstly they have removed their fine dining Italian (Blu D'Orange) and replaced their Moroccan restaurant with a more casual feeling Italian. We dined at the casual Italian and the food was very average and the service was terrible - endless mistakes cold food missing main courses and I had to get up and hunt for a waiter when we wanted a bill as they were all busy out the back of the restaurant for ages. It didn't come close to the stunning meal and service we had the previous year at Blu D'Orange and the service did not resemble anything we've come to expect from this hotel or any four seasons hotel. We did get a complimentary bottle of sparkling wine due to the problems.    Service by the pool and at breakfast was also fustratingly poor. We had four breakfasts and every single one my father-in-law's coffee and tomato juice was forgotten the waiter kept giving the wrong people drinks and we kept having to ask again for items. Worst of all our last breakfast there were no cooked items in the buffet and a whole section was missing that was out the other days. So we all had pastries pancakes and cereal. When our plates were being cleared and we'd finished our coffees/tea the waiter decided to offer us cooked breakfast menus and let us know that on Tuesday's you ordered cooked food from the a la carte - I mean seriously to wait until 45 minutes into our breakfast? It was a joke.    Poolside food was good and there is no doubting the quality of the produce but again it was lazy chaotic service. I had to ask for a missing items several times and at our final lunch the deserts took 30 minutes to come out (no apology) and the pancake and waffles which were meant to be freshly cooked were cold. In addition the ""pancake with lemon and sugar"" came with orange pieces on it and no lemon. It's just frustrating at these prices.    We dined out at La Comptoir Trattoria and La Palace Club (all recommendations from the hotel) - each one was superb in terms of food and service and if we return we wouldn't eat dinner in the hotel - which isn't a big problem but it's unlike any other four seasons I've visited in that respect and detracts from the ""resort"" nature of the hotel.    Overall things were not as slick as last time. My parents in law requested a wake up call which was inexplicably forgotten and it took three calls over a 24 hour period to get someone to fix our sink which was broken on arrival. On check in I was told I'd been upgraded to a pavilion room which was the room I had booked.    On the plus side is the concierge and front of house service is generally exceptional we had an itinerary put together and it ran like clockwork and check in and check out was very good. Service from concierge before the stay was impeccable. The rooms and facilities are faultless and the pool area and poolside service is the best at any hotel we've been to. The SPA is also stunning.    I left the hotel relaxed but also slightly frustrated and embarrassed that I'd gone on about how great the four seasons chain and this hotel in particular is to my parents-in-law for it to then let us down with poor service at nearly every meal to give a distinctly average impression. Maybe we were unlucky this time round.    I personally would return but my wife would prefer to try the Mandarin Oriental next year. One thing is for sure when dropping around £5000 for two couples in 4 nights there shouldn't be so many issues and the excellent work and service delivered by the front of house teams and poolside team was really undermined by the food and beverage team on this trip.",Date of stay: October 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JPAP-SHLC

So nice and he even called the IT chap  Down to pool as my wifi was not working!  The pool is huge and just so nice and beds are very soft.  We were upgraded to a pavilion room and it was huge!!!  The only downside of our time was the digging and construction work outside our door so make sure you ask about that and get a room  Away from that.    The evenings are very dead here .

We used the gym adult only pool ate breakfast each day and dinner twice in the solana restaurant and asked the concierge to assist us with trip/restaurant bookings. Every service and ask was executed flawlessly and with a smile.    The only downside was some continuous and irritating construction work ongoing near to our room and close to the adult only pool (large generator and pneumatic drilling!). Normally we'd expect a small card with an apology in our room and some mention when we checked in. But there's be no recognition of same which is disappointing. Perhaps no one know whose responsibility it is to communicate this to the guests?!

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,t0mdill0n wrote a review Sep 2016,50,best hotel experiece ever,I stayed in the 4 seasons Marrakech with my daughters for 4 nights in September 2016. the service and welcome was absolutely fantastic. I really couldn't fault a thing. while obviously pricy my room had a free 4th night which helped. breakfast is a sumptuous combination of buffet and a la carte table service. the restaurant serves Moroccan and also Lebanese dishes a la carte- very good as it means you can order a few mezze if you are not hungry or full dishes like tagine if you are more hungry. alcohol is pricy but not outrageous - a similar property in Dubai would be 30% more expensive..  the pool is excellent - constant care from the staff (complimentary water shakes sunglass cleaning) - also the pool café is nice - good combination of mains and starters. concierge was good - organised camel riding for my girls. 3 things stand out for me (1) the service was genuinely friendly and professional (in other words excellent) at all times - and I mean at all times - I met at least 30 staff and they were universally delightful. (2) on the last day we had a late flight and the reception offered us a free late check out for one of the rooms - generous and thoughtful indeed and (3) after we had left the property and were at the airport it transpired that my daughters had left their purses in the room safe. I called the hotel and in less than one hour I had the purses in my hand delivered by the security team. amazing.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,matt c wrote a review Aug 2016,50,"Wonderful place, Spcial thanks to MarrakechDayTrips,com",Like so many earlier reviews our experience at the Hotel Four seasons was excellent. We also booked this Hotel based on tripadvisor reviews. From the moment I started email communication back in the UK to the day we left Marakesh we couldn't fault the service. It was a special Anniversary treat for four nights and all the staff at the Hotel made us feel special. It's hard to describe the level of service can expect as a guest of the Four Season. It's an unbelievably gorgeous property with white glove service you won't soon forget.  What more can I say other than this hotel is utter perfection. We had a VIP pick up at the airport which was superbly handled (reverse on the way out). It took 20 minutes from walking off the plane to checking in at the hotel. Everyone knew our names as we arrived and throughout our stay. It felt very personal.  Every aspect of the hotel is decorated in a very ornate tasteful Moroccan style..    Rooms : spacious the best air-conditioning system since so silent ! Great for such a hot place and I can never sleep well if there is sound. Very peaceful could not hear anything from any other room nearby and also very quiet outside.  Comfortable beds. Lovely bathroom and a great wardrobe area...somewhere I can finally fit all my clothes in without any issue !  Wifi all over the hotel was great strong and no signal problems at all. Very impressed and its very important to me.  There was a wide breakfast choice and all was cooked and presented well. This was a la carts not buffet style.  We got quotes for a day trip Atlas Mountains from other agencies but we took one of the stuff recommendation to go with MARRAKECHDAYTRIPS which was actually cheaper than any of them and all organised so professionally. A day trip to the Atlas Mountains is well worth taking although the roads aren't for the faint hearted! Having a guided walk is also a pleasure as is lunch overlooking the beautiful scenery    Thank you to the staff for making us so welcome and for giving us such a wonderful experience of a vibrant city.,Date of stay: April 2016,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B9756EPmattc

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,lovestravel65 wrote a review Jul 2016,40,Perfect place to relax away from everything but close enough to the Medina too,We had a lovely relaxing week here. The weather was good and we spent most days around the pool where we were looked after well. The staff are very attentive and helpful.  Our room was huge with an enormous bathroom too which was lovely. Four Seasons remain on of my favourite hotel groups. My only gripe was that we were in the adults only pool and for 2 days there was a family with a toddler there and in the pool. Despite other guests complaining the staff seemed unable to deal with t which led to an awkwardness for the rest of the guests. Another family were turned away with a child so I found it a little wrong that a different family were allowed to stay. If it's billed as an adults only pool t should be an adults only pool.,Date of stay: May 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lovestravel65

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,meheartsthevacays wrote a review Jul 2016,50,"Gorgeous resort, but very sleepy & dead at night","This resort is absolutely gorgeous. The grounds are expansive with mature palm trees and lush landscaping. Excellent and well thought out lighting contribute to the beauty of this resort at night. We had a premium king room which was on a higher floor with a large balcony overlooking a pool and the fountain. Here are the pros and cons:    PROS:  - Beautiful grounds  - Good sized rooms with large bathrooms with separate showers and tub  - Excellent room service. We arrived fairly late and ordered room service at 1 am. The food was delicious and the nighttime room service staff (the same person whom we got to know over our several nights at the resort) is excellent. He was friendly and by the second night would refer to us by name or ask if we wanted the same order from the night before. There is no additional charge for room service (prices appeared to be the same as the restaurant) nor was there an automatically service charge. (We always end up tipping the same but it's nice when a hotel doesn't force it on you especially when the room rate is already so high). We also loved that when asked for a wine recommendation the gentlemen who worked the nighttime room service suggested to us the local Moroccan wine which happened to be the least expensive on the menu. (I'm skeptical and often think people are trying to upsell you.) Turns out that it was really good and we ended up ordering there more bottles of it over the course of our stay.  - Huge gorgeous pool  - The food was pretty good. Dinner at the Moroccan restaurant on the terrace was excellent. We got a few mezzes fatoush salad pride with cheese and peppers (sort of like calzone) and chicken skewers. Lunch at the poolside restaurant was less remarkable. We opted for salad and pizza so it may be our own fault for straying from Moroccan cuisine.  - Felt very safe. We had to go through three different security checkpoints every time we entered the hotel (guards check the car/taxi before the gates are opened for entry onto the grounds a second check at the guard gate and then bags are checked as you enter the lobby). One time our taxi driver for whatever reason had a friend in the front seat. The hotel security guard asked him to get out of the car and wait outside the gate while the taxi circled through the hotel to drop us off. The staff is extremely polite and quick so we never felt that it was obtrusive. With everything going on in the world we preferred knowing that precautions were taken.  - Concierge is excellent. She gave us several great recommendations that we really enjoyed. (See my separate reviews for La Maison Arabe La Sultana and Jad Mahal.)  - Valet/bell staff was also excellent. Called taxis for us and gave us waters every time we left the hotel. The taxis called from the hotel charge you a fair price (50 dhm into the Medina) rather than those on the street trying to swindle you.  - Housekeeping did a great job. Very nice and friendly.    CONS:  - Very sleepy and quiet at night.  - Bar closes earlier than advertised on website. We like to option of staying up late on vacation so it's important to us to have the option of a cocktails or drink late into the evening. We specifically checked for this option on the hotel website which says that one of the bars is open until 1 am. Perfect! Turns out that's just plain wrong. Everything at the hotel closes at 11 pm including the bar. So our only option was to order wine from room service (but at least there was no up charge! See above).  - The pool hours are very short. The pool closes at 7 pm which seems odd given that the sun did not even set until around 8:30 pm while we were there.  - We did have one issue with housekeeping. This was our first stop on our trip so we were very jet lagged. As a result we put our ""privacy"" tag on the door each night and often slept until 2 pm. (After all it is vacation right? There are no rules! You get to do what you want.) Notwithstanding the privacy tag housekeeping telephoned us every day at 2 pm and woke us up to see if we wanted our room cleaned. It would be one thing if say reception called for something not knowing that we had the privacy tag on the door. But in this case housekeeping saw our tag and knew we did not want to be disturbed but called anyway and woke us up. Doesn't make sense.    Overall I would highly recommend. I would definitely stay here again the next time we're in Marrakech.",Date of stay: June 2016,,"Los Angeles, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/meheartsthevacays

Slick check-in via the Four Seasons app with notification that our room was ready (by e-mail) before we even arrived. Didn't even have to go to Reception we were taken straight from front of hotel to our room in a golf buggy. Absolutely what was needed after an early start!  We were looked after from start to finish in a professional and expert manner. Pool staff at the adult pool and breakfast team deserve particular praise nothing too much trouble. Given this was Ramadan and most staff probably weren't eating or drinking between sunrise at 3.30 and 19.45 sunset this kind of service and dedication to role is astounding.  We have been to the Four Seasons Marrakech before but everything seemed that little bit sharper the team really seem to have kitted together. Loved the addition of the Lebanese restaurant in Inara.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,NLTG15 wrote a review Jun 2016,50,Excellent!,We had a wonderful stay at the Four Seasons and I think this hotel is amazing. Everything was pretty much perfect with excellent food and service. The grounds are great too and the whole place has a very relaxing and tranquil vibe.    Our room was lovely with a great balcony and a nice big bathroom. The view was of the gardens but I was hoping to get a glimpse of the Atlas mountains but I’m not sure if you can see them from the hotel. I did ask to see another room to compare and this was arranged very quickly however I decided to keep my original room.    We had breakfast at the hotel every day and it was excellent. We also had lunch and a few snacks by the pool and they too were excellent. We really loved the adult pool it’s a great size and we were very lucky that it wasn’t too busy. Throughout the day you are offered complimentary snacks – all very tasty and exotic! The only thing I found annoying was that sometimes people were a bit noisy and I thought as an adult pool people would respect the peace and quiet. Maybe management could review this?    As our first time in Marrakech Concierge were very helpful and also arranged a guide who took us on a half day tour of the sights. This was very useful and informative.    Bear in mind if you are visiting in the next few weeks it is still Ramadan however this did not affect our stay.    One other thing the hotel is only 10 minutes from the airport. I arranged a Range Rover transfer via the hotel which was very nice but looking back now was probably a wasted expense.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,PebblesFlintstone wrote a review Jun 2016,30,Great rooms and grounds but food and service lacking,The title says it all really. The rooms were gorgeous and are the grounds. We were planning to go sightseeing during the 4 days we stayed in Marrakesh and enjoy the evenings at the hotel.    Didn't seem to be much going on. One restaurant was closed and the other only served Turkish food which was good but you'd expect to have some local dishes when in Morocco. As a result we would extend our sightseeing and eat outside before coming back though room service food was good.    On the last night we decided to play it safe and eat at the hotel but were told the ovens were not working and they couldn't serve any food. Eventually they said they could serve us a limited menu and so we waited. It was not very nice and in fact gave me stomach trouble which is not what you want on your last night. What they should have offered was complimentary transport to/from another hotel or restaurant but when we enquired that was not on offer.    Another sore point was the level of service and attitude at the spa. They simply did not know what they were doing when it came to the manicure service and then pulled a face to boot. Was not impressed.    Final gripe was when we asked the price for a transfer to Casablanca Airport. We expected it to be a little higher but the price quoted was a complete rip-off and was in fact more than the cost of a flight from Casablanca to London! I can't believe anyone would ever consider using their transfer services. Instead we negotiated a reasonable price with a taxi driver and all went smoothly.    It is a crowded market in Marrakesh and unfortunately through no fault of its own tourism is suffering in Morocco. Four Seasons need to address a lot of issues if they want to become a destination of choice in Morocco. It is a shame as we thought 4 nights at the Four Seasons was a banker to ensure a relaxing end to our holiday but in fact it scores lowest of the four places we stayed at in morocco.,Date of stay: May 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PebblesFlintstone
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,EqualRightsTourist wrote a review Jun 2016,40,Great Location For Business Travelers and Centered In The New Development of Marrakech,This hotel has one of the nicest grounds out of any Four Seasons I've stayed at. A huge gym and yoga room two traditional Red Clay Courts with a former World ClassTennis Pro  Talal Ouahabi who I got to hit with. The rooms are nice. Our room had a balcony but it faced the restaurant which provided no privacy. The room were very clean had huge bath tub and separate shower toilet. I really enjoyed the service at the pool which is standard at any Four Seasons but the staff here was very friendly and attentive which we appreciated so much. The restaurant Inara has some of the best fusion of Turkey Moroccan Mediterranean food I have ever had. They cook and season most of the dishes in a wood fire oven. I highly recommend it it's the type of food that belongs in SF or NY. Overall I'd give this Four Seasons a 4.5 star. The Spa which I used everyday is awesome hands down an amazing Spa you have to use it while being there it's a must. One day I couldn't find towels not sure why. Also the Azzera tower restaurant wasn't open. I think if they would just have the bar open with the views it would have been perfect and every guest would be even more impressed with the layout of the hotel and views of Marrakech. I spent most of my money eating and drinking at terrace restaurants Riad's with terraces etcc... so it was disappointing that we could appreciate the Azzera. The Four Seasons is really hurting itself without this restaurant.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,JackieMcK2014 wrote a review Jun 2016,40,Rooms need updating!,I totally agree with previous travellers that the gardens pools and pool service are fantastic at this hotel. The staff are mostly excellent extremely friendly and helpful apart from the concierge service. I am not sure if it was a language barrier! My granddaughter has coeliac so must have a gluten free diet but this was barely catered for in spite of the hotel having had advance notice of this! One of the managers did apologise for this on the last day but it was rather too late then! Rooms are kept spotless but look quite tired and need updating. The curtains in our room were falling off the runners and letting light in at night - something that needs to be checked more thoroughly by housekeeping or maintenance. The rooms are beautifully spacious with large balconies and lovely bathrooms (although somewhat lacking in toiletries for a Five Star hotel). The hotel was kept beautifully clean however the birds in the dining room at breakfast were somewhat off putting! It is a great shame that the rooftop bar has been closed along with the restaurant below it as several friends commented on how good it was - there are now only two restaurants in the resort open in the evening - one upstairs in the main lobby with a bar and the other is the one used for breakfast which is an Italian in the evening. The choice of food was not that good for a hotel of this rating and the Italian restaurant lacked any atmosphere. The resort should advise travel companies that the rooftop bar with views of the Atlas Mountains has shut down as there is nowhere to go after dinner. Our family has stayed in several Four Seasons hotels and apart from the staff and the gardens this one is not up to their usual high standards.,Date of stay: June 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JackieMcK2014

However the gardens and pools are quite stunning - and the service provided by the pool staff is outstanding. Lots of iced water with lemon treats and sun glass cleaning!    We had a deluxe room - and if they could have provided a coffee machine more teas and a better turndown service with a chocolate perhaps bath and basin plugs that weren't broken - then this would be a top hotel in my view.

From being picked up at the airport to being dropped off at the airport the people that work here are like no other. They make sure everything they do for you is always above and beyond.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,stephmck1312 wrote a review Jun 2016,40,"Good Hotel, but some major improvements needed!!!",We have just got back from a weeks holiday at FS Marrakech.  Check in was swift and easy (although no drinks were offered which considering I am 5 months and obviously pregnant isn't great!).  Our rooms were Pavillion rooms overlooking the family pool. Very spacious Lovely big bathroom and terrace with good views. The only downside was extremely hard and uncomfortable beds!  The grounds of the hotel are stunning- we have never stayed somewhere with such beautiful gardens which are constantly pruned and kept nicely. The hotel itself is lovely and kept immaculately.  Whilst the resort isn't huge so easy to walk around the buggies are on call and were there within a few minutes of calling for them.  The spa- a tranquil place to come and relax out of the sun and have treatments with a nice chill out area to sip Moroccan tea afterwards.  The Family pool is very cool (literally-it's not heated  it's so icey cold at the start of the day until the sun warms it up!) and the pool staff are fantastic-constantly bringing glasses of iced water cleaning your sunglasses bring fruit sticks/cocktails/ice creams etc. and shaking out your towels neatly when you can peel yourself off your sun lounger! ;-)  Breakfast- there is a good variety of food but service can be a bit slow.  Lunch-we ate in the restaurant next to the Adult pool everyday(which I think is the only one open!) which was sheltered by gazebos and a nice place to get out of the sun. There was a great variety on the menu and staff were friendly and efficient.  Dinners- with ONLY 2 RESTAURANTS as the one next to the Roof top bar and the bar itself have both closed to guests and apparently are only available to residents dinner choices are therefore limited to either the breakfast restaurant which lacks serious atmosphere or the Lounge restaurant near reception which is better. WHY?? one of our friends said how great both were when they came last year- the bar had a DJ which gave it a great atmosphere (that the hotel now lacks in the evenings!) and had stunning views and the restaurant next to it apparently was great too! If we had known this we would not have booked the hotel with only two choices of restaurants-it should be stated on your website! Which brings me onto two BIG negative points unfortunately...  THE CONCIERGE- quite honestly towards the end of the week I gave up! She kept booking restaurants that were no where near what I was asking for which we then ended up cancelling and eating in the restaurant in the hotel anyway! I clearly explained that my daughter had to eat somewhere with GF options and that I was pregnant and wanted a good standard of food clean restaurant to eat in and she kept trying to book cafes with slow service and where people had recently had food poisoning!!!(as I read here on Tripadvisor!) If you only have 2 restaurant choices in a hotel then you should have more information and a better concierge to recommend outside eateries!!!  THE FOOD IN THE HOTEL- in our opinion the food was just not good enough for a Four Seasons resort let alone a 5*!!! Every meal time something got forgotten or messed up-I don't know if it was a language barrier but sorry thats just not a good enough excuse.  THE WORST part was- my 9 year old daughter has Celiac Disease-it means she has to have a very strict Gluten Free diet or she gets very sick! Our Fantastic travel rep at Elegant Resorts in the UK emailed the hotel twice to explain prior to our journey and ask that alternative Gluten Free foods be arranged for our arrival. The only gluten free available to her was pasta and a very odd cake like bread. It took until halfway through our holiday for them to get GF flour to make breakfast pancakes the chips were not GF there were no cakes or biscuits or snacks made for her-like we requested either. I find this disgusting and not nearly good enough quite honestly. I'm sure if someone had a nut allergy their needs would have been met?  So the big question is- would we stay here again?? The honest answer-Probably not! They need to sort out their concierge and standard of Food massively plus re-open their bar+restaurant before we would even consider it! What a shame as the rest of the hotel and staff are fantastic!  We are repeat Four Seasons guests at a different hotel which is incredible which now leads me to wonder if this hotel is a one off or should we expect this at some of the others? If I had the option I would rate this average-Good as the food situation really lets it down!  A big thank you to the staff by the pool the housekeeping the gardeners and the staff in the Lounge restaurants in the lobbyand poolside restaurant for making the majority of our stay good-we really appreciate everything you did.,Date of stay: June 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Surrey, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stephmck1312

The spa was excellent and the team were all very friendly especially the restaurant teams who went above and beyond to look after us. However there were a couple of areas that could have made our experience 5 stars rather than 4 which were; there is a roof top bar is shown on the website but not open to normal residents restaurant/bar needs to serve more local dishes of quality our room was missed cleaning on one day and service was slow compared to the expectation when staying at a Four Seasons.,Date of stay: May 2016,Trip type: Traveled with friends,Haywards Heath,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HeatherE950

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Milehighchrissy wrote a review May 2016,40,Four Seasons with a local touch,"I will echo others in that no this hotel is not ""central"" but agree that that's very apparent in research. It's a very secure estate of hotel and private residences you will have to take a taxi to explore. Get over it.  Typical of a four seasons the touches ate there so you know it's a Four Seasons but they are as always sympathetic to location and the hotel had gorgeous more can touches everywhere though modern as only 5 years old.  It's an epic property with the hotel areas in the middle and private residences around the outside.  It was quiet when I went and I travelled alone. I didn't find a comfortable or lively area to eat or drink in the evening but that may be more with timing of the visit.  Pool areas are excellent split into family and adults areas and far enough apart to really be separated. Attentive pool staff and a mix of regular beds and cabanas makes for a relaxing day by the pool.  Staff and friendly and kind. Food was excellent bar one tagine which I think was personal taste.  If you are with children they have an excellent kids programme for all ages so you can get space.  For the grown ups great gym and tennis. Also a fabulous spa with hammam.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Kelly S wrote a review May 2016,50,A Gorgeous Oasis!,"Four Seasons offered a Family Retreat Special (4th night free) & included breakfast. We booked two Pavillion Rooms which were huge impeccably clean fabulous bathrooms and each room had large balconies with lounge chairs overlooking the adult / quiet pool. Decor was gorgeous modern Moroccan decor. We were traveling with our three adult daughters and this layout was perfect. The staff was professional very friendly and if we were in need of something out of the ordinary their response was ""we will find a solution."" The concierge Selma was extremely responsive and professional. She managed all of our pre-arrival requests: a surprise birthday cake upon arrival airport transports tour guides cooking classes and restaurant reservations. All of her recommendations were right on target. The grounds are incredibly beautiful it is definitely an oasis and a 5-10min drive to the Medina.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Richard C wrote a review May 2016,50,"Luxurious, exotic, faultless",Having heard much about Marrakech we finally made the trip there last week for a 5 day holiday. It exceeded my expectations.    The hotel is located about 5-10 minutes by taxi from the city centre. It is about 15 minutes to the airport too - very easy to find and everybody knew where it was (taxis Tec.) So NO it. Is not centrally located with walking distance of market. We were well aware of location in advance having done our admin - would think this would be normal practice these days given ease to do so and general cost considerations. At the same time we chose the hotel for its gardens and peaceful vibe. There are 2 pools one for families and another one for adults. I find it extraordinary that people complain about the distance. Taxis are plentiful and we never paid more than 50 dirhams to get anywhere.    We saw food and menu online in advance and felt that prices were reasonable given that we booked this many months ago as a special treat to celebrate our anniversary. It is an extraordinary place and we were ready for this in advance...on this note I find it surprising to see people shocked by the prices (if you want something cheap and cheerful then don't go to a luxury 5 star hotel and perhaps go to McDonald's?) Food was superb.    I was blown away by the gardens. Photos do not do justice when attempting to capture the lighting detail and lawns. It compares with the most beautiful that I have ever seen.    We had a garden suite close to the pool with two large terraces. We never get room service normally but it was too tempting not to have it here (great room service from Jamal)... sitting with a view of palm trees and birds and subdued lightingwatching sun go down with call to prayer in the distance... extraordinary.    I used the health centre. The masseuse Tarik was outstanding. Highly recommended and would definitely go back.    We look forward to returning here one day again for another special occasion. Faultless friendly service... everywhere we turned there was someone waiting with a smile and suggestion.,Date of stay: May 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Switzerland,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D3910DSrichardc

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,RJP wrote a review May 2016,50,Four Seasons save the day,Four Seasons are perhaps the most upmarket hotel chain on the planet.  Staffing levels are very high. Their properties are always immaculately maintained. I always try to stay their if possible.    The Four Seasons Marrakech is no different.    The resort/compound is massive beautiful and feels very safe. Security at the front gate was akin to getting into a military base (quite rightly)    There are 2 huge swimming pools on opposite sides of the resort (one for adults only). Both are heated and so great for swimming in the off season.    There are several restaurants on site (we ate at all of them and the food is fine without being memorable).    If booking a suite with a plunge pool be aware that most are not heated.  This may be fine in summer but in early December despite outside temperatures of 25 degrees the plunge pool was way too cold to use.  We changed suites to one without a plunge pool but with a 3rd floor view of the Atlas Mountains.    Marrakech itself in my view is a dreadful place.  Third world poverty shops selling the same tourist tat (metal teapots tatty leather goods carpets slippers spices) and lots of European students/tourists.    I have no idea why it rated so highly on trip advisor.    However the Four Seasons Marrakech is wonderful.    I would go back as its only a 3hr flight due south from London and great for some winter sun on a long weekend.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,LoveToTravel wrote a review May 2016,30,Way outside of town. Have to taxi everywhere.,This is not the best location there is. And not that impressed.    The grounds are very nice and employees are good but you are not close to anything. You'll have to depend on taxis overcharging you for every trip. You should never pay more than 20 dirhams to go anywhere but the bell guy and parking staff will tell you 100 and I'm sure they get a cut. Even the hotel staff is in on it. Cannot stand that. They should be looking out for their customers not trying to assist with the shady taxi drivers.    Food and drinks in the restaurants are grossly over priced but you are stuck at the hotel in the middle of nowhere so the price to take a taxi and back getting overcharged each way makes it a dilemma. 190 dirham ($20) for some pasta and tomato sauce seriously? Already paying an extreme amount for the rooms why try to milk you for more. Just not right.    I was told 2 times at check in that breakfast was included but unfortunately in reality to was NOT! Very costly mistake at over 350 dirham per person. Extremely disappointing to be told one thing then charged.    I won't stay here again as I like to be able to walk around on my own without having to rely on others. Make sure you do a bit of homework on location and proximity to what you like to do and where you would like to go.    The staff is quite friendly and the beds are extremely comfortable. So they have that going for them. Cannot understand the little pottery bottles in the shower filled with something. Is it shampoo? Conditioner? Body lotion? Shower gel? They aren't labeled so who knows????? Sometimes places like to be too cutesy and functionality suffers. This is one of those areas. No labels on the liquids. Also there is no small store for drinks sundries or other needs you may have. Such as not in the mood to pay 80 dirham for a Coke! Seriously? Usually both Africa and Middle East hotels provide complimentary mini bar for customers paying several hundred dollars per night. Seems cheap and petty.    It's a good hotel with private residences also located on the property but won't be staying here again. No way. Was kept up all night one night due to mosquitos buzzing around my ears and biting me.    On 2 separate occasions the front desk and reception told me they would get right back to me in regards to my questions. Never to they get back to me and return my calls as promised.    It's not all negative as that would be unfair. The entire property and rooms smell wonderful. And music is always being softly played throughout the grounds. But still you are near nothing at all. Even the driver from the airport couldn't find the hotel.,Date of stay: May 2016,Trip type: Traveled on business,Los Angeles,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Love_To_Travel_XO13

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,markzz2 wrote a review May 2016,50,Delightful stay,We visited Marrakech for a very short weekend to attend a party and wished we had been able to stay longer. The welcome at the Four Seasons was superb. We were escorted to our room which was spacious comfortable and beautiful and had a lovely terrace with subbed beds and a table and chairs.  We ate in the Lobby on the first night and had what is probably the best Mezza I have ever had. A wide variety of Arabic snacks with warm bread and very attentive service.  Breakfast was lovely and consisted of a large choice of pastries fruits and hot and cold breakfast items and again he service was very attentive and timely. In fact everyone at the hotel was delightful.  We arranged a private guide to show us some of the sights of the city which was a great (and not too expensive) way of seeing a quite chaotic and difficult to navigate city. We appreciated the guide and his knowledge and think it was the best was to see as much as possible in a short time. The city is well worth a visit.  The concierge were very helpful and we had no problem with the bell staff arranging taxis for us and agreeing fares with the drivers before we left. Taxi's in the city are sadly always trying to rip off tourists so we refused to get in unless a fare was agreed before hand.  The pool areas in the hotel were stunning The peace and quiet was amazing and only the sound of the many birds was to be heard (a great relief after so m any recent hotel visits are spoilt by terrible music being played everywhere......). It was so much nicer to have some peace.  We can't wait to come back!,Date of stay: May 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markzz2

We stayed in three different rooms next to eachother (125 126 and 127). It is expensive (we paid about Euro 400 per room per night excluding breakfast) but the rooms are very spacious very well equipped and the hotel offers all facilities you would want. Above that the staff is very helpful and friendly and made us feel very much at home. The only comment I have is the location: it is more than walking distance from where ever you want to go in the city so you always need a cab. However it is easy to find a nice taxi driver who will bring you everywhere you want to be not too expensive.,Date of stay: May 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Amstelveen, The Netherlands",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/883markv

By the way I had no problems with the staff and during check incheck out all went smooth and staff was very friendly and helpful core of the problem is the management well if you consider to pay reasonable amount of money for a room which is triple charge of Le Meridien's delux room and double of its executive room you should have expected something different after all both hotels locates on the same avenue.  we had stayed at four seasons BALİ UBUD it was great like a magic world and thought it would be the same but failed. hotel was quite very few customers there no attraction was in not like UBUD Four Seasons no attractions ( dancers musicians )nothing that is why I called pensioner's house thanks god there were two famous classy clubs PALAIS JAD MAHAL and COMPTOIR DARNA now management may say this is non of their business attracting the people letting them enjoy during their stay  I think that is wrong if a customer pays that amount of money per night that customer is classy and look for something different than the other resorts or hotels may offer them . after all hiring belly dancers and musicians for some time while having drinks on the terrace is should not be very costly.  time to think over dear management better not to leave everything on staff you should be creative so that you may fill your resort with lots of charming people not like what I have experienced during four night stay.  by the way i am a loyal customer and member of FOUR SEASONS as well as other group of hotels HHONORSSHANGRİ-LASPG and MARRIOTT that is why I myself obliged to write this review for the sake of group and resort itself .,Date of stay: April 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Istanbul, Türkiye",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gurhan33

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Reuters wrote a review Apr 2016,40,Fantastic for Families,As a family friendly hotel this is a truly lovely place to stay. We stayed here with our 8 and 11 year olds. They had a wonderful time around the pool in the kids club and the teenage centre and we were able to relax.    As you would expect from Four Seasons everything was very slick and well maintained. The staff were extremely professional and friendly. The facilities were fantastic - great gym lovely pools nice spa etc.    Our room (Deluxe Pavilion Suite) was spacious and easily accommodated our family.    Indeed everything about this hotel screams high-end international resort. So as destination to go to with a family you won't really go wrong but as a result it also kind of lacks character and becomes a bit bland and sterile.    In conclusion we had no regrets in coming here with our children and would certainly endorse it as a great place to stay as a family. However in a wonderful City like Marrakech there are some far more interesting and unique places to stay so if we were not with children we would probably have chosen another hotel/Riad.,Date of stay: April 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Reuters

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Cathar75 wrote a review Mar 2016,50,The... Best... Hotel Ever.,"Stunning the word of another reviewer best summarizes the grounds and experiences of the Marrakech Four Seasons. We arrived perhaps not in the same fashion as other guests (black luxury SUV private limos). In fact we arrived in a dusty van that we'd just been in for four days of mountain to desert nature adventuring and the night after sleeping in a tent in the desert. Disheveled unwashed and with dirty hiking shoes and random clothes spilling out of camp bags- we were immediately welcomed like royalty into the best accomodations that Marrakech has to offer. They had already upgraded our room and unlike large resorts nearby of this caliber this setup is more like a series of private two-story buildings with amazing landscaping and private balconies (meaning two balconies to our single room). This meant we still had an amazing view of the Atlas mountains but an even bigger space to soak in this super deluxe amazing hotel experience. The king bed in this hotel was simply the best bed I've ever slept in and it (and likely the very private/quiet surroundings) was the best and most restful sleep we've ever had. The staff is world-class trained in customer service and they excel at every opportunity. Finding out it was our honeymoon meant we came back from the souks one night to a bottle of champagne and ""Happy Honeymoon"" cake they set up in our room! The next night we witnessed them surprising an elderly couple (about 80 yrs old) with a ""Happy Anniversary"" cake through room service too. These generous amazing staff go well out of their way to make sure guests have an outstanding experience whether it's poolside (gorgeous heated pool and jacuzzi btw!) or when we left in the taxi for the airport and the bellman remembered that I like The Telegraph and tucked that newspaper into my carry-on. I couldn't have imagined or dreamt of a better experience in any way for our four nights. We had room service breakfast one morning... you simply need to see it to believe it. Also to get basically anywhere we wanted to go around Marrakech it was a pre-negotiated 50Dhm rate and they have their own subset of taxis that arrive for you on-demand. The only tradeoff about this hotel versus a hotel within the medina is the need to take a taxi into the medina. It would be possible to walk if you weren't shopping as much as we were perhaps. :)",Date of stay: March 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Minneapolis, Minnesota",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cathar75

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,VictoireWang wrote a review Mar 2016,50,A truly wonderful experience,The three days we spent there were the most memorable ones. The hotel is near Marrakech yet it has enough distance to be in a quiet neighborhood. If you really want to go to the souk everyday (which i don't recommend) the hotel provides good shuttle bus on regular schedules.    The breakfast is delicious and the ambiance of the restaurant is simple but luxurious. I call it the Hermes restaurant since the shade of orange they use is the famous Hermes orange. Orange is the happiest color. The best of all is the heated outdoor pool which makes the stay in late January and early February a truly enjoyable experience.    We made a mistake of leaving the city and went to a desert camp which the owners claim to be luxurious. We spent two whole days on the road to get to that camp only to realize the camp is very basic. The establishment is outdated especially the beds the floor carpets and the so called bathrooms. The desert wasn't really special since the sand was not as red as it is from other parts of Sahara. Strangely we spent a lot more of our budget on that desert camp than on the Four Seasons resort. I wish i had done differently.    My advice is that you stay in this hotel or similar luxurious hotels near Marrakech. Then hire a car with a driver for a day or two so that you can see the mountain and a bit of the desert nearby. Go to the souk for a day just to get your curiosity satisfied. But don't spend too much time there because you can get exhausted from what seems to be a whole city of people who want to sell you something. If they had used fixed pricing we would have bought more things. It's an ordeal to buy anything from that city. Get your peace and peace of mind at the Four Seasons.,Date of stay: February 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,Geneva,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VictoireWang

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Mike D wrote a review Mar 2016,50,"Great hotel, one of the Best getaways in many years.",The hotel is a great getaway from the hustle and bustle of the Medina and the Old City. Yet close enough to get to the Old City quickly.  Excellent spa and restaurants and property. You feel like you are coming home rather than to a hotel/resort. The views around the property matched the pictures a really beautiful place.  The Solano restaurant was excellent visited it twice for dinner. The staff for breakfast was good at introducing you to new items which quickly became favorites.    A tip for a new visitor Relax and enjoy the slower pace at the resort. Leave the hustle and bustle the horns blowing scooter whizzing by and what seems like the hectic pace of the Medina in the Medina!

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,MasterP0 wrote a review Mar 2016,50,STUNNING HOTEL away from the hustle and bustle of hectic Medina!,From the moment we arrived we were treated like royalty. At the time of booking I did request a Twin room but was given a Double room upon check in. In their defence I had not booked direct but through BA so it's BA who probably didn't communicate this to the hotel.    Anyway this wasn't a problem we checked in went to the Double room to relax until they found a new room for us. Not only did they find us a Twin room but we were upgraded as well!    Both hotel rooms were BEAUTIFUL with plenty of room huge room with table and chairs balcony (Double room had a garden view with two sun loungers) upgrade room had table and chairs and a lie down area. Walk in closet in both rooms and both had a HUGE bathroom with separate toilet.    The pool staff were great so was everyone else we encountered all polite helpful and friendly.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Amal wrote a review Mar 2016,50,A stay surpassing our dreams,We stayed at the Four Seasons to celebrate my grandmother's 70th birthday in the beginning of March. This was her first time staying at a hotel let alone a five-star hotel / resort and it was the best option in Marrakech we could have possibly booked. The service was outstanding and the best any of us had ever experienced. They treated her with the upmost respect and anticipated her every need and desire. My grandmother is Moroccan and even she was impressed by the Moroccan decor and Moroccan cuisine the resort. I've stayed in five star hotels around the world including the Chicago Four Seasons hotel and this resort by far surpasses all. The resort is in a good location next to the Jardins a la Ménara and a short car ride away from the Jemaa el Fnaa and the Jardin Majorelle (YSL gardens). Down the street there's a location for the popular horse carriage rides around Marrakech and camel rides.    Highlights:  * Moroccan tea during check-in  * Top Notch showers  * Hotel entrance smelling like roses burning fireplace and the sound of parakeets  * Complete breakfast buffet at Solano including freshly pressed juices and traditional Moroccan selections. A special thank you to Achraf for taking special care of us and preparing a dish just for my grandmother  * Attentive pool staff. Upon arrival we were greeted with ice water and lemon. At the Family Pool the staff threw in some pool toys to make the pool even more fun. While doing laps at the adult pool the lifeguard supplied hand paddles and flippers.  * Heated adult and family pool.  * Straw hats and quality sunscreen available by the pool.  * Clay tennis courts. Thank you Talal for welcoming us.  * Visit the Young Adult Center for foosball pool/billards darts outdoor ping pong basketball video games (Mario Cart 8) movie theater and Tech Center. Thank you Mehdi for your assistance.    The only problems were the closing of the rooftop Terrace for construction which sacrificed views of the mountains. However we understood because we stayed during the off-season and it was nice having the Resort quite vacant. When we expressed our disappointment the staff made it right.    Recommendations:  Keep the young adult center open later than 9 p.m.  Have the pool open earlier than 10 a.m.    Overall this resort comes highly recommended and I will certainly return.,Date of stay: March 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Cardiff-by-the-Sea, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amalperrotin
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,lisabinnyc wrote a review Mar 2016,50,Beautiful for Business,We were here for a convention. It was really perfect for this - to have all the participants and meetings in one area. The place is massive yet also remarkably quite charming. I think the big advantage to the grand scale of the place is that it allowed all of us to be on one campus without feeling like we were under each others' thumbs. So from a business perspective - excellent. Our suite was also splendid. Lovely cushioned areas on the patio overlooking the pool and gardens. Architectural details that felt authentic to Morocco. The staff was professional and cheerful. the food was A+. Best of all however the Hammam. This was my first - and wow! The hotel also has a fabulous roof-top bar/club with shisha that is a lot of fun.,Date of stay: April 2015,Trip type: Traveled on business,"New York City, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lisabinnyc
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,ahitah wrote a review Mar 2016,50,Amazing hotel,We had a very enjoyable stay in February. The weather was unseasonably warm so we were able to enjoy the pool. The heating didn't work on the first day but it was fixed by the end of the day. However I still found the pool a bit too chilly at 27 degrees. The gardens are big and very beautiful. We enjoyed an early morning jog. The kids loved the young adult centre with its computers video games pool table etc.  We had lunch at the grill by the pool which was most excellent. Kids enjoyed the food from room service. The staff were wonderful & very attentive.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Andrew C wrote a review Mar 2016,50,Amazing Royal Villa,I stayed here in the 4 bedroom Royal Villa in October 2015 to celebrate my 30th birthday with family. The hotel organised the perfect surprise (for everyone else in my group!) birthday party including a live DJ local band local outfits for dancing shisha (with the coals prepared in our villa garden next to the pool!) and a very tasty BBQ and we all had the most memorable and amazing evening eating around the pool in our own huge private villa. This was all organised by Karima who really did the perfect job in ensuring everything goes smoothly and has my complete appreciation! Everyone had a great time.    Other nights we were in the hotel's rooftop bar and had a great time with excellent service from Youssef every night - we felt like he was genuinely pleased for us to be there and that we could ask him for anything and he would help us.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,John D wrote a review Feb 2016,40,Generally good but a some issues,We stayed for 3 nights at around £214 per night (excluding breakfast). We were upgraded to a deluxe room on check-in in the main part of the hotel. It appears that there is little difference between superior and deluxe rooms except for the view. The staff at the hotel were very courteous and professional. The room itself was comfortable. I was expecting slightly more from the rest of the property however. The restaurants and bars were a little lacklustre the heating was broken in the thermal pool in the spa and one of the pools was out of action for maintenance. However what the hotel lacked in resources was made up for by the level of service which was excellent throughout. The concierge organised a private tour of the Medina and surrounding area which we really enjoyed and the service at breakfast was prompt and efficient.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,HadleyFife wrote a review Feb 2016,30,Average,The Four Seasons in Marrakech is well positioned only a short drive from the airport and the centre of Marrakech. It occupies a large compound which contains the main hotel and rooms villas and the Four Seasons Private Residences. These are set within gardens which are pleasant but not spectacular. Security is good and there are plenty of staff at the reception. We were not shown around the resort on arrival.    Main parts of the hotel are clean and comfortable. In February the hotel seemed almost empty apart from the last day when the hotel was hosting a large conference - this changed the atmosphere from a vacation hotel to a crowded convention centre which was not nice. There did not seem to be a different part for delegates and the lobby and lounges became noisy and busy.    The room was adequate but there is not much more to say about it. The bed was comfortable. The iPhone station is outdated and does not work with iPhone 6 and the English TV selection is very limited. Toiletries that are provided are cheap.    Breakfast and service was good. Other bars and restaurants lacked atmosphere and food in these decidedly average and quite expensive.    The larger pool was closed when we visited which we were not informed about and was not explained. The smaller pool was fine but cold.    Spa was a disappointment and could be much better. Jacuzzi was broken. Similarly the gym (which is large) was missing several pieces of equipment that I would have expected (e.g. rower Bosu PowerPlate).    I would return to Marrakech but probably not the Four Seasons.,Date of stay: February 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HadleyFife
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,luxadvisor wrote a review Feb 2016,40,Pleasant Hideaway...,Four years after its debut in 2011 this property is among the favorite one for luxury hideaway in Marrakech. Located just a short ride from downtown Medina It is a perfect hideaway from bustling Medina.  Under the new guide of Mr. Félix Murillo (who joined FS back in 1993) - this property still maintain its high standards of Service.    As my local taxi pulled in to the hotel - the assistance with the luggage seems a bit slow and no smile or warm welcome as I expected . Well I guess I should try a limousine next time :-)    The check-in went fine agent was able to process it quickly. Welcome mint-tea was offered during arrival. Agent was friendly. As it is a trip to celebrate my father birthday. Our room was a bit far at the end and as it is a trip to celebrate my father birthday - I asked nicely if there could be another room available closer to the pool area - Unfortunately the request was kindly decline.    Room was booked under Virtuoso - upgrade was provided along with welcome amenity and personalize card. House keeping agent is very attentive an extra hotel postcards were delivered upon request.  Birthday amenity was delivered in the evening... Many Thanks    The property is beautiful there are two pools available.  Pool service attendant are very friendly and attentive. Water and glass cleaner was provided during the stay.  Gym and Tennis court are well maintained.  Spa is clean and well presented.    Main Concern:  Spa Menu price need to be well printed and informed.  The price from.... to .... is very unclear.  I learned after that there is a High season price and Low season price for the spa.  I guess it is a new trend ...  will we anticipate in the future a restaurant also offer a menu with high season and low seasons price ??    Upon check-out I did address my concern regarding the spa.  The agent was professional and able to solve it.  Luggage assistance and transportation arrangement were provided upon departure.    Suggestion for improvement:  Room:  Luxury standard meet.. but nothing is special.  Ex. Why not provided an authentic handmade marrakech straw bag in room for guest to use during their stay... great option as pool bag to carry books etc.    Breakfast:  The selection is ok.. but hey this is Four Seasons.. people expecting WOW...  La Mamounia & Royal Palm Marrakech... have better presentation and selection..  and not to mention the newcomer Mandarin Oriental is eager to impress...    It was a short stay but we did enjoy it.  As people says.. getting to the top is hard but to stay on the top is harder.  I hope FS Marrakech will be able to maintain its reputation among all the savvy traveller.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,twoworlds wrote a review Feb 2016,50,Wonderful!,If there was one criticism I'd levy at the Four Seasons it's that its buildings and decor are mildly bland in appearance compared to its category for Marrakech. It's very pretty but you could almost believe you're in Scottsdale!    The ambience of the room and terrace could be greatly improved with some more locally themed artworks in the rooms and some plants and climbers and maybe wall tiling on the terraces. Now for a self-confessed fusspot like me if that's all you're hearing about after 5 days you know it is a good hotel!    Other than that the Four Seasons is perfect. The flip side of its being an international chain and thus a bit under-decorated vs the fancy local competitors is that the Four Seasons sure knows how to run a hotel and therefore you're not leaving good hospitality working amenities etc to chance.    The entire staff was amazing the adult pool is lovely and large (and heated in winter!) The room is extremely spacious with a dressing room massive soaking tub and the most comfortable bed I can remember sleeping in since the Park Hyatt Toronto c. 2000!!    It's not cheap but it's definitely value for money. Will go back. I almost didn't go here because the photos make it look so dull; almost like a conference hotel. It's not like that at all in reality.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Luke M wrote a review Jan 2016,50,Favourite Hotel In Marrakech,Checked into the Four Seasons after an unfortunate (hour) stay at another hotel. I called up made a booking and a car was outside my current hotel 10 minutes later.    As soon as you enter the grounds it feels like your totally out of the city even though your not! Grounds & gardens are very well kept very quiet lots of birds chirping the rooms are very well thought out the depth of the bath is truly amazing and the terraces of the rooms offer beautiful views.    As a Vegetarian my usual issues with most hotels (especially in Morocco) is the lack of Vegetarian options or having to ask for substitutes. I travelled alone this time so only made use of the room service menu which was fantastic. A wide range of choice both Moroccan and international at great prices. Presentation (both plates and table layout by waiter) as well as taste was great for all meals!    My flight was not until 5pm and the hotel offered me a complimentary late check out which was great. I did book a transfer to the airport with the hotel at first its 600 MAD fee (around £45) seemed crazy considering the airport is 10 mins away however the service provided was great. Instead of the car dropping you off at departures they take you to the check in desks help with your bags and see you off through security. Allot more easier than previous experiences and would use this service again!    I appreciate allot of people come to a resort to relax and get away from life and internet however I am not one of those people. The wifi needs to be sorted! Very slow even on the premium service (Around £15 which I had taken off the bill) It is usable however for a premium price resort it should be allot better.    Overall I would say this is my favourite hotel in Marrakech so far and look forward to coming back in the Summer!,Date of stay: January 2016,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yelim_88

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Marcus wrote a review Jan 2016,50,Absolutely fantastic!,The four seasons hotel Marrakesh is superb! A tranquil and beautiful place for all the senses. Me and my wife stayed for two nights to celebrate my wife's 40th birthday. We made the booking through Grand Luxury Hotels and we were given a Guest Experience Manager who was there to help with any quires. When I made the booking I mentioned in the notes that it was for a special occasion.  When we arrived we were given a room upgrade from a Delux room to a Premier room.  Inside our room was a lovely bouquet of red roses and a hand written card from the general manager.  During the whole stay we were made to feel special.  Besides the outstanding beautiful setting of this resort the staff really made the difference. Both nights we received a complimentary limo to our restaurant in town. The second night Rabiaa from the hotel Concierge made us a reservation at the La Masion Arabe restaurant (I highly recommend!). Again a complementary limo and a fantastic greeting at the restaurant with a lovely romantic table.  Rabiaa had also mentioned it was my wife's birthday and to our surprise the waiters sang my wife a song and presented her a cake.  We felt special that we came from the four seasons hotel and were given a driver back to the hotel after our evening meal.  The facilities spa pool the breakfast were all above expectations. Most of all the friendliness and service of the hotel staff is what I will remember the most from our lovely stay. Especially Rabiaa who went the extra bit to make sure my wife's day was a success.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,gkyip wrote a review Jan 2016,50,Beautiful oasis,Fantastic piece of luxury in Marrakech. The resort itself is wonderfully appointed and beautifully decorated. Small touches make it feel truly luxurious such as the flower displays everywhere chirping birds in reception and the various herbs on display as you walk around the resort. My Premier room was lovely albeit a bit small considering the resort is so large. Nice decoration and layout with a luxury bathroom deserving of its 5 star title and the highlight was the private balcony which was a good size and had an unbeatable view of the moroccan sunset. A problem for some is that rooms facing this way also face the airport where it can be noisy. Not an issue for me but may put some people off.    There is a lot to do on the resort. 2 large pools a spa tennis courts a gym and several restaurants and bars. The Italian restaurant seemed a little out of place in Morocco but was excellent. The rooftop bar at the centre of the resort was nice and the breakfast offering was plentiful. Service throughout the resort was exceptional but I was lucky to arrive at an extremely quiet time of year where at times it felt as though I was the only one.    I paid a visit to the spa which was truly 5 star. The prices seemed high for Marrakech but the service surroundings and products used went some way to justifying the cost. If you want to try a Moroccan hammam this would be an excellent choice especially for a newbie such as myself. The gym is also well equipped with separate cardio and resistance rooms.    Location is also good and makes everything very accessible.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Fabriceleparc wrote a review Jan 2016,10,Very nice 5* but not the Four Seasons experience at all,"The idea when staying at the Four Seasons is you give up on the charm and location of luxury Riads (or La Mamounia) for a top-notch “resort” experience with well-known standards.  Working in hospitality like the friend I was staying at I know the “brand bible” of Four Seasons very well and surprisingly this is the first hotel of the chain which doesn’t respect it.  We got a discount on the rack rate which is way too overpriced vs competitors if you have to pay it.    For a little more La Mamounia offers a much better and memorable experience and a myriad of Riads intimate warm personalized service. Then the Mandarin or the Royal Mansour are quite a few levels up.    In short this resort simply does not respect Four Seasons standards and I’m very surprised Head Mgt don’t fix that.  For sure it’s really not horrible at all no serious issues at all: the one star is harsh but you pay for the “Four Seasons experience”.    GENERAL    Staff is efficient but really cold esp by FS and Moroccan standards. While everyone speaks perfect French in town they persisted addressing us in English and just never ever greet you.  They should at least say “Sir” or “Monsieur” in French (very impolite not to do so) and not just “hey” “Black coffee"". Arriving at breakfast all we “got” is “what room number?” and while breakfast was included they still insisted on us signing a bill.  No: they need to check period. Had to email reservations to reconfirm again. No greeting at the pool or when you pass by staff. While the hotel was virtually empty.  Waiters would pass by not offering any drinks and literally grabbed the bottle of water from me when I had to help myself.  Those are major no-nos at Four Seasons in every country they train their staff to greet be friendly and speak politely and adapt to clients.    RESERVATION / RECEPTION    Quite a few emails and a 30 min check-in bc the guy had decided to put us on a different rate than our confirmation.  Showing the emails just led to lengthy phone calls (and the staff insisting we were mistaken) and I eventually chose to help myself with the tea which (while we were alone) was not offered.  The hotel is 5 mins away from the airport and the hotel offered a 60€ transfer which is absurd and more than any of the luxury hotels which are much further.  We never managed to get a metered taxi and the 4 guys at the entrance never bothered to speak with the driver about directions.    LOCATION    Location is definitely out of the way and there is nothing within walking distance. You do hear very loud airplanes.    ROOMS & SUITES  Great bed. Large but not impressive too generic. The only difference on room categories is the floor you’re on I would for sure not pay the extra.  By 7 am the room is very bright I know hotels gave up on proper shutters but the curtains are really inefficient.  2 mini tiny bottles of water per day in a country where you can’t drink tap water.  Small bathtub only 2 large towels and we always had to ask for bathrobes.Products in little ceramic bottles which they make sure you know they’ll charge 20€ if you take one.  No hotel guide room service menu spa menu…  View on Atlas advertised while the Premier room faces the opposite direction.  Teas were not refilled.  AC had to be fixed when we arrived and doesn’t go below 75°F.  Again these are just is not FS “basic” guidelines. You should absolutely be able to choose what temperature you like in fact I have never been in a hotel that “regulates"" your AC.    RESTAURANT  Only one open very good but .. the bar and the 2nd one were simply closed. May be “off season” but this is a huge resort.  Breakfast is good but you really need to insist for cutlery refills.    RESORT  Beautiful “new” grounds very large but pool water was barely heated and was loaded with chlorine. No one ever came to see us.  Great gym but we were kicked out at 9pm sharp. All FS I know are 24/7 and if they have to add one staff bc you want to stay longer they are supposed to do it. Low season or not.  We were left to figure out where things are no big deal but signage is almost non-existent.    ATMOSPHERE  Empty and cold esp compared to La Mamounia which was bustling. Not sure about the point of going to Marrakesh to end up in an international rather non -descript resort. The only “local” touch is the subpar service. Was woken up from a siesta to ask if if wanted service. No! Do not disturb is here for a good reason and if you want service at any time they’r supposed to do it.    WIFI  The “fast” one is 15€/device/day this is just preposterous. The free one is fine but we’re in 2016.",Date of stay: January 2016,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Paris, France",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fabriceleparc
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Adam T wrote a review Jan 2016,50,This is a real resort,The Four Seasons Marrakech is a real oasis in Marrakech. Clean large modern and beautiful. The rooms are not amazing but are very nice and clean with nice balconies. The outdoor courtyards are magnificently laid out and candles surround them by night. The staff speaks all languages fluently and are very friendly. There is enough going on that you would not have to leave but of course you should to go explore.    We got a Hammam treatment and massage. Very clean and great spa with friendly staff. I would recommend brining your own bathing suit unless you are very comfortable wearing what they provide.,Date of stay: January 2016,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adamt275
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,TravelCoachOriginal wrote a review Jan 2016,50,"Excelent, but with very few dinning options",The hotel is excellent as you expect when staying at any Four Seasons resort. Hard to compare with other branches as they are all very different in terms of size and structure. For me the key comparable things are the high service standard and maintenance level.    The hotel is located far from key touristic destinations of Marrakech but you can easily access all but a short and not very expensive taxi ride (normally €5 each way). The hotel could offer a complimentary day transfer to the Medina though. That would be very useful and customers would be very thankful.    Service was great everywhere in the hotel. Special thanks to Youssef from the Zest rooftop bar. He was great!    The hotel does not have many dining options. They have only one restaurant open for dinner during 6 days of the week... and the place is small and with no options of local dishes. Also the restaurant hostess was not very nice (only service issue we had was at the Arancino restaurant). For lunch they had only the pool restaurant open (something that could be a problem in case of rain or a cold day...). The lobby lounge was closed for renovation.    Our rooms were very nice big and with great bathrooms! It was not very easy to get located in the hotel in the first day but then we got used to the complicated building layouts. There is a serious acoustic problem as the long corridors do not have carpet. Also during the last night we noticed a strong cigarette smoke smell in the room.    Pools and SPA are beautiful and very well maintained!    Four Seasons APP was very useful and worked very well for almost everything (except for laundry and SPA).    Looking forward to get back! Highly recommended!,Date of stay: January 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Sao Paulo, SP",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelCoachOriginal
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Akshay A wrote a review Jan 2016,40,Great service but little variety,We had a wonderful time at the resort. We spent 5 days there over Christmas break. Special commendation to the hotel for finding us a doctor and going out to get medicines when our 18-month old fell ill.    Pros: Great service from all the staff. Kid's play centre & events organised by that team. Huge heated family pool (important when the day's high temperature is around 20 C!). Nice rooms.    Cons: No variations in the menu (e.g. daily specials) especially in things like breakfast buffets and so meals got very monotonous. Poolside menu limited as well.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Tarek D wrote a review Dec 2015,40,Day visit,We were staying at a local riad and decided it would be nice to spend a day by the pool. This was one of two places we tried (the other being Sofitel). We found this expensive but of a quality you would expect of four seasons - free sun cream water provided and as many towels as needed. Nice heated pool which the kids enjoyed and very attentive service. The place was a bit quiet compared to the Sofitel so one day was enough for us.

The breakfast at hotel was just fantastic and we all enjoyed it and were great and welcoming.  The kids club was just great for the young ones and left them with friendly staff.  Me and my wife had great massage treatment.  It was so great my wife also got a pedicure and facial as a treat from myself.  The Spa was great with relaxing facilities together with jacuzzi.  The hotel was not as busy.  The Kids menu was great.  Had a deluxe room which was spacious.  The Menera mall and the Jemda fana Square was about 10 mins away from hotel.  Used different methods of transport horse carriage richshaw and also taxi.  Will definitely recommend the hotel staff and it's facilities.  All staff are welcoming friendly always smile on face happy to help you and you treated as a family and you don't miss your home.  Had TV  DVD player and allowing to play movies from USB memory stick.  Even managed to get great Indian food at Le Jardins Koutoubia and we all loved the atmosphere and the food there although relatively expensive costing around £60 for 2 adults and 2 young children.

I fell in love with the scent they had in the Lobby and throughout the hotel and wanted to but it. They didn't sell it there during my first visit but when I went back they sold it and now I use it throughout my own home.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Adam H wrote a review Dec 2015,50,Fantastic Resort,You stay at the Four Seasons for the Service and quality. The Marrakech resort will not let you down.    The driver organized a baggage handler to help with our bags at the carousel. The baggage fellow took us to the driver (exchange some cash at terminal so you can tip- and don’t forget to get some small bills.) The driver whisked us away in a Land Rover (we had golf clubs plus bags) and in 15 minutes we were checking in. Love that arrival after an overnight trip from America to Madrid layover and flight into Marrakech.)    Off to room and a week of golf and sights. This is a great resort. They organized a guide for 3 trips including the medina and Essouria. We had the same driver for all our dinners out our longer trips and even up the Ourika valley — where he organized our trek up the mountain to the waterfalls.    Honestly every dinner every trip the concierge made our time in Marrakech incredibly easy. And every night our suite was simply fantastic - clean cool appointed easy to use. Great.    Traveling in the “low season” of America’s Thanksgiving week we even received 2 free nights after buying 5 - but nobody seemed to care we had a special package.    Yes a Four Seasons is expensive. But they make your life incredibly easy. For example every time we walked into a restaurant the hostess would ask “Reservation?” I would say my name and there would be a sort of blankness as the language gaps showed.    Then I would say “Four Seasons” and it was like light bulbs came on. Suddenly it is back to me “Oh Four Seasons. Right this way.” We always were taken immediately to our table. We always had a FANTASTIC table that was well placed not near a door or inconvenient yet clearly one of the best tables in the restaurant. And the staff was immediately there asking if we wanted water something to drink etc. The service was great because the Four Seasons called ahead made the reservation and the restaurant knows to treat you well so they get more business.    Now what is that worth? You can’t buy that extra service?    You are in Morocco and have to buy a rug or some spice or some silver. Do you really think you will get the good stuff? Will you know where to find the best merchants from the tourist trade? Could you know how to distinguish the good stuff from the chaff when sitting in some shop? Why not have the Four Seasons set you up with a guide and for $100 you KNOW you are in the right place and you know the pricing is not some long-winded negotiation.    Now what is that worth?    Yes everything costs more. But really you have a great room. The entire facility is safe (they bomb check every entering car.) They arrange all your details. And it is beautiful.    My one tip - at this particular location if you do not have breakfast included I recommend you eat in your suite. The room service breakfast is incredibly good and it is priced attractively ala carte. We found we preferred it to paying $30/day each for the breakfast buffet.    If you aren’t staying at La Mamounia you should be at the Four Seasons. And it is VERY family friendly. Just email them about their daily children’s programs.,Date of stay: November 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Las Vegas, Nevada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adamh540

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Cozeee wrote a review Dec 2015,20,Beautifully built luxury hotel with slipping service,The facilities in this hotel are just great - as in all FourSeasons hotels .  But the service - despite an extremely friendly staff - is appalling - slipping in every corner - not up for a 5 star hotel. After 25 minutes wait you get the wrong food drinks at dinner are served when you´ve already finished the meal ( depute reminding them again and again .  The room we were given was completely dusty from a terrace refurbishment - apart from extreme noise from those building works. As the hotel was half empty - we could have been given another room easily from the start.  The Spa is good but only one male masseur employed who on top does not have the skill for a good massage. Staff s chatting among themselves and forgetting the breakfast service - also you feel watched like in aquarium by too many staff at all times .  But the moment you need something they look away or are overly slow and complicated in their response..  There seems to be no management and certainly no one to train staff on a 5 star service level.  Maybe the reason for such bad service : Members of staff asked me to tip in cash - as the hotels keeps the major portion of their tips ( which everybody adds generously on every signed for bill). Of all tips only a small portion is paid out to the staff. I think in Europe such practice was not even allowed .,Date of stay: October 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Düsseldorf, Germany",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cozeee

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,nkem wrote a review Nov 2015,30,Average Five Star Hotel,This is a great hotel and I am not giving it 3 stars because I think it is a 3 star hotel but because for amongst five star hotels it is average at best. My review is also colored by fact I spent the preceding days at Kasbah Tamadot so comparing the two is like night and day.    The staff facility and rooms are great as others describe but there were some aspects of service that really didn't meet expectations for a Four Seasons hotel. For example I was shocked to take my 8 year old son to play tennis and was told we had to pay 220 Dh to use the tennis court - seems real tacky to me and not seen such an expensive hotel charge to use a tennis court. Also having to call to have toiletries replenished or have tea restocked in room is not what I would expect. The hotel arranges city tours but our tour guide was no more than a salesman and all he was interested in was conning us into buying commodities from his allies in the souks. Really for an official guide being arranged by a four seasons hotel such side marketing should be prohibited. Indeed he spent more time trying to have us convinced to buy goods from 'his' shops than he did showing us the city. Frankly the tour was a waste of time and money and we later had to find our was round the attractions.    There were some very good aspects. The Young Adults Centre was great as were its staff - anyone with Children should check it out. The staff there were always willing to engage anyone who visited and kept the kids occupied. They would also engage adults and I played few games of ping-pong pool and table soccer with the staff. Miriam and others at the gift shop were also great.,Date of stay: September 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,New York,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nkem

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,RonaldoDaSilva wrote a review Nov 2015,50,Marrakesh Luxury,After a couple of days at a traditional Riad in in the Medina area we checked-in at the Four Seasons for a few days o splendor. The Four Seasons for me embodies the concept of of a 5-star hotel. Always cordial and willing to assist with genuine smiles on their faces my first praise goes to the staff of this property. Amazing! We had a few special requests for playtime and work reasons and all of our needs were met in a timely and graceful manner. The room was classic Marrocan luxury and full of special details. High ceilings that made it spacious and grand. Terrace area with mature trees and plenty of lounge areas. The first day we had lunch by the pool restaurant and it was delicious. Service again rocked. The grounds of this property are well manicured and rich. The common areas were incredibly designed to a tasteful decor. While located outside of the Medina transportation to the Souk is readily available and it took us just a few minutes to reach the area for some craft shopping. On one of the days we requested a car service to take us to Richard Branson's retreat up in the Atlas mountains which is a must do trip if you don't mind winding roads. Our driver Semed was personable played excellent local music and took pics of us along the way - ask for his services and you will be very pleased.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,PhineasfoggEngland wrote a review Nov 2015,40,"Good, but probably not the best of the Four Seasons group...........","My group and I were in Marrakech on business for a week in November. As a Hotelier and someone who travels a great deal I am probably more critical and harder to please than most. However as I know only too well what it takes to operate a hotel I hope that I am also realistic and compassionate at the same time.  I chose the Four Seasons primarily because of it's close proximity to the Palais de Congres . Somewhere where I was going to spend most of my time whilst in Morocco.  As with most hotels in Marrakech the grounds are extensive and beautiful. The scent of orange blossom fills the air and there are lots of little hideaways where one can find shade.  The hotel obviously caters to families with children. There are two pools and a children's club. There were no issues with children although that might be more of an issue in the high season ?  My suite was part of a Villa (25) and it was spacious clean and had everything I required. I especially liked the sizeable balcony on which I could escape the air conditioning and enjoy a pretty good view of the grounds. It was on the first floor and I'm not sure the ground floor suites would be quite as good as you are close to and on the same level at the pathways that traverse around the property.  My suite had a very large bathroom with tub shower and separate toilet cubicle. There was a walk-in closet  king sized bed and T.V. Altogether very comfortable.  I used the laundry service several times and it worked very well. My clothes were always returned the same day and laundered properly. My only gripe was that they didn't replenish the laundry bags and forms when they had been used without the need for a phone call.  My group and I ate at the hotel almost everyday and we experienced all of their restaurants and bars. ""Zest"" was my personal favorite. A roof top bar that serves light meals. Great atmosphere and interesting décor. Very friendly and convivial staff making it a good place to chill or network.  Breakfast was by the fountain pool and it was extensive and covered all dietary requirements. The service was good but not great. Sometimes confused and slow.  We usually ate lunch at the alfresco restaurant ""Azzera"" . Casual and well laid out with more capable staff and quite an interesting menu.  I highly recommend Moroccan wine. I had two very good reds while staying at this hotel and they compared very well to the best Napa reds.  Outside of business hours I frequented the hotels spa on a couple of occasions. While not as good as the spa at ""The Mamounia"" I found the staff capable and friendly.  If you don't want to venture into the chaotic world of the Medina there is a good boutique run by a very friendly and helpful Swiss lady named Miriam right on the property.  All of the reception staff were very friendly and helpful. I found the same of the numerous drivers that I used during my stay. All are multi lingual and capable.  On a side note it's well worth exploring Marrakech if you have more time than I did. I made it to the mountains on two occasions and they are beautiful.",Date of stay: November 2015,Trip type: Traveled on business,British Virgin Islands,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PhineasfoggEngland

Our favorite item was the delicious freshly made flatbread served with wild honey - addictive! A highlight was a nightly cocktail (or two) at the rooftop bar over the Italian restaurant.

We called housekeeping because the glass top to our coffee table was sliding a bit when our three year old was playing and they quickly came and took it away to avoid any injury. We thought the food was delicious at all the hotel restaurants. The pools are all heated so perfect for babies. The concierge arranged a driver and guides to take us around the city and souks - all wonderful. Our daughter loved the kids club and the fitness centre was five star. It was the perfect short getaway and we couldn't say a bad thing about the great service at this hotel. We especially thought the poolside service at the family pool was wonderful.

The Solano restaurant was under going renovation and only reopened towards the end of our stay but overall the choice of restaurants was a disappointment and menus were limited  however the concierge was very helpful in suggesting restaurants and helping us make reservations. We really enjoyed the pop up restaurant 'Bombay Cut'  the food was excellent and very good value.It is a shame they did not do this type of thing more often but given how quiet it was perhaps the hotel expects guests to eat out most of the time.We enjoyed the canapés offered during the Aperitivo evening but were surprised that management did not use this as an opportunity to meet guests and again it was very quiet so perhaps the hotel could do more to promote itself.We made regular use of the courtesy car which is available in the evenings and found all the drivers to be helpful and very informative about Marrakech however it was only through reading another review that I knew the car was available so this is something else that could be promoted  Many other reviews mentioned that service is poor  we had a mainly positive experience and found the staff to be one of the hotel's best assets however if the hotel was busier they might struggle.  There are a couple of reasons why I gave only four stars and said almost perfect firstly breakfast my husband likes a hot breakfast and found the bacon potatoes etc offered in the buffet to be consistently cold credit to our waiter he noticed that my husband had left most of his meal and when he became aware of the problem made a member of the management aware although the manager apologised nothing was done to rectify the problem.  My main issue however was on checkout I noticed two overcharges on our bill and although they were deducted no explanation was given for why they were there in the first place . On our first evening we arrived late and ate at the Italian restaurant we had a couple of pizzas  one pasta dish  two glasses of wine and a Coke so when a bill for over 3000 dirhams (approximately £200) we checked and could see we had been given another table's bill the waiter took the bill away and we signed the correct version however the 3000 dirhams reappeared on our final bill as a charge for lunch the next day as we had indeed had lunch and dinner in the hotel that day and could show them the bills we had signed and they had no signature for the disputed amount they reluctantly accepted that we had not had lunch twice. The second overcharge was much smaller and was a charge for pool service for our final day as I knew there should be only one charge which my son had signed for I questioned the second charge and although they could not provide a signed receipt we were repeatedly asked if we were sure we didn't have something extra. As I mentioned they did deduct the amounts but I wad left with the feeling that they were doing us a favour and giving us the benefit of the doubt they didn't seem to see the connection that the only two charges I questioned were the ones they had no signature for.  I would still recommend this hotel but would say check your bill carefully and whilst I might stay at a Four Seasons again could not say it would always be my first choice.,Date of stay: October 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Aberdeen, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StevenbAberdeen

The hotel and staff were wonderful and could not do enough for us. Spent many relaxing hours around the pool with complimentary iced water and other treats.  The roof top terrace was a welcome place to have a drink and start an evening in Marrakech but we choose to eat in the town on our three evenings. The hotel was refurbishing one of the resturants at our time of staying.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Ismoon wrote a review Oct 2015,40,An Oasis of Calm,I stayed here on a 70th birthday trip with my mother because I wanted something a little away from the hustle and bustle of the city. I had a car pick us up from the airport and from the first moment I was happy that I made this choice. The service was excellent and the rooms were comfortable. My mother used the spa and thought it was fabulous. The concierge was extremely helpful and arranged for guided tours of the souk and Essaouira. All of the staff were extremely solicitous and pleasant.    The hotel is about a 50 DAM cab ride to the center of town ($5) and close to the airport. The car that the hotel arranged for airport pickup was expensive ($60) but to me totally worth it. After flying 15 hours it was nice to be immediately in the lap of luxury. We also ate in the hotel restaurant (I think the Azzera Grill) which was decent but not particularly memorable.,Date of stay: September 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,Charlotte,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ismoon

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Sheila J wrote a review Oct 2015,50,Lunch and Spa,Unfortunately we did not stay at the resort but did manage to have a luxurious afternoon. We started with lunch at the Azzera Grill down at the end of the pool. The service was exceptional as was the food and cocktails. After sating our hunger and thirst we were escorted to the spa for an afternoon of pampering. I personally believe that the spas located within any Four Seasons Hotel anywhere in the world provide the best spa services Ever. And the spa here in Marrakesh was no exception. We were treated like princesses. The premises are beautifully appointed and the staff were very professional courteous and endearing. By the end of the afternoon we did not want leave. It was an amazing day of indulgence. I loved it so much I contemplated repeating the afternoon again the next day but did not make it.  I look forward to my next visit.

It takes about 10 minutes and $5 for the ride. The gardens at the resort are well kept. The adult pool is very nice but very cold for October when the temperature is only 22 C.

The hotel is well maintained but I would have appreciated advance notice that the breakfast Resturant was under renovation. Noise from the constant drilling was a pain. It's due to be finished by 15 th oct. This said the staff and management were fantastic and nothing was too much trouble including a late checkout and arranging food that wasn't on the menus. The fact that staff remember your name is a nice touch and not unnoticed!  Pool staff are very attentive with nice touches of water and attention through the day.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Sidneyoz wrote a review Oct 2015,40,It doesnt get much better than this,Spent a week at this fabulous resort hotel last week. Our room was spotless spacious and special. The whole hotel is immaculate with vast pool areas I particularly like the quiet pool (adults only) with a lovely pool restaurant. The Italian restaurant served food as goos as any London restaurant but overall tyne thing that makes this hotel stand out is the staff. Without exception they are all terrific from the managers to the pool boys I cannot speak more highly of them all. I must single out however Sammi in the restaurant and Adnane on reception both charming helpful and extremely personable. If you want a relaxing week being pampered this is the place for you.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Duta56 wrote a review Oct 2015,50,A true gem,Spent 7 amazing nights at this beautiful hotel. From our arrival to our departure we were made to feel as special guests. We booked a deluxe pavilion suite more than enough space for our family of 5. The large living area was converted into the second bedroom at night and an extra bed was provided for our 5 year old. Our own plunge pool which we didn't use as the water was too cold; a little sitting area with table and chairs where we had breakfast delivered to a few mornings to avoid the chaos at Solano. We had villa 34 which is ideal is you are looking for privacy. Even though being opposite the kids club it wasn't as noisy as one would expect.  Upon arrival the dining table was laid with cookies and candy awaiting the kids. Since we had a long drive from Casablanca to Marrakech these treats were really welcomed by the kids. The concierge found out that my husband and I would be celebrating our anniversary the day after our arrival we were sent a small cake and our table at the Italian Aranciano was beautifully decorated.  Few people complained about the service but we didn't experience any such thing. On the other hand the Four Seasons is what it is thanks to its staff. Ahmed took extra care of us during Breakfast at Solana and Marouane will also greet us in the morning even though he only served us once at dinner. The girls at the spa Malika Soraya and Beda are just amazing people. They couldn't do enough to make me feel at home. Wished I found out about the spa earlier during our stay. It actually became my haven when the hotel got busy during the Eid holidays. The family pool got packed and my daughter and I would take refuge to the small indoor pool in the spa. Would have loved a bigger pool though. I had a hammam and massage during the stay; was quite disappointed with the massage and when Malika heard about it I was offered a complimentary half an hour massage. It really made up for the disappointing experience.  The ladies at the concierge the other Soraya and Salma also welcomed me with a smile and were patient to answer my questions and giving directions to where to go for shopping.  A few things which could be improved upon is the fact there aren't enough eating options. The kids club was a big let down to my daughter. Not enough activities and they close at 5pm. Most of the time we would be out during the day and when coming back to the hotel around 4pm it would be too late for her to go to the club.  I booked a half day guided tour through email before our arrival but it seems they didn't receive the latter. So we were left to wonder around the old city by ourselves. Probably a blessing as we got to see what we wanted to see and spend as much or lesser time. Regarding activities I've done my research prior to traveling to Marrakesh and found out about two great companies for Atlas mountain day trip and hot air balloon ride. The Four Seasons do offer similar activities probably at similar prices but for us we wanted to experience a bit more than just the usual touristy stuff and we did!  By the way the hotel boutique is ridiculously overpriced. Their products might be at the high end in terms of quality and local brands but similar items can be found in the souk for a fraction of the price. Haggling is a must and start with a fifth of their asking price. Leave the designer bags at home when you go shopping.  We just can't raving to our friends about our experience at the Four Seaons. We chose it because of the family atmosphere compared to the Mamounia and Palais Namaskar. Thank you again for making this a memorable trip. Will definitely visit again.,Date of stay: September 2015,,"Jeddah, Saudi Arabia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Duta56

The rooms were HUGE as were the bathrooms. The beds were like sleeping in giant marshmallows (very comfy) and the pool area and grounds were lovely very well kept.    It was my birthday when I arrived and there were flowers sparkling wine and a delicious choc cake waiting for me - its the little things. The breakfast is to die for too and in a beautiful settting too    As with the other Four Seasons Ive stayed in I also like that thre is a plentyful supply of water and sun cream as the heat is unforgiving at some times of the year.    I didnt think it was close enough to walk to the centre of Town but I think I went the wrong way.

Beautiful land scape and a huge resort with nice 2 pools and less restaurants than expected in such a huge place.  We were booked in a pavilion suite which is ok in size and a nice plunging pool but you would expect more amenities in the suite when booked in a nice resort.  Food was average and would give it 6 out of 10 but was very disappointed with the service received during breakfast…very slow reply and there was hair in the food and no one even apologized when I informed them.  The waiter was very rude and while he thought I did not understand the language he was saying bad things to his colleague about us and other guests of the hotel.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,TCK83HK wrote a review Sep 2015,50,"Two annoying events but overall, great stay in stunning property, made special by the exceptional team",The Four Seasons Marrakech is a fabulous extensive property with stunning landscaped gardens and water features equidistant from the airport and the Medina. With a two year old we didn’t venture much into the old city but there was a shuttle service and an excellent concierge desk to sort out any request. Our suite was very comfortable with an enormous bath-cum-dressing room and a terrace with its own plunge pool a stone’s throw from the wonderful family pool and the kids’ club which looked super although seemed very Francophone and so we didn’t use it? The food & service in both the main Solano restaurant and the Azzera next to the adult pool was varied and delicious and the staff particularly kind and indulgent towards our lively daughter. She particularly enjoyed the Moroccan musicians playing every evening. Sadly we had a very unfortunate experience at the Bleu d’Orange Italian restaurant on our first night in the hotel. Asked by manager Federico Colombo how our food had been we replied truthfully that one pasta dish had been very poor and not at all what was described on the menu. This was met not with an apology but with a disagreeable shrug and the suggestion that it was our palate rather than the kitchen which was at fault. The next time we visited Bleu d’Orange we were made to feel distinctly unwelcome and did not patronize the restaurant again for the rest of the week. Another member of staff told us that Sr Colombo was under a lot of pressure hosting two top chefs for the Settimana Italiana week; however that is no excuse for the poor way in which we were treated. Another quibble was the fact that my iPhone 5 left in the Solano after dinner one night never reappeared with the loss of several special photographs of our holiday. We cannot fault Mehdi the head of hotel security who mounted a comprehensive search for the phone but quite frankly a misplaced smart phone or other device should simply not be stolen at a hotel of this calibre and standing. Mehdi was just one of the wonderful team of staff at Four Seasons Marrakech who really made a difference to our holiday. They also included Yassine and his wonderful team at the roof top Zest Bar with its view of the Atlas Mountains Lina who oversaw the Solano breakfast all the pool team including Abdulatif and last but not least the lovely Jihane and the fabulous ladies of the conciergerie and the guest relations team. Overall despite a couple of unfortunate experiences very highly recommended for a wonderful week or weekend in the stunning Marrakech climate.,Date of stay: May 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TCK83HK

It could be top hotel in Marrakech however the service is in dire need of improvement. When I arrived I was told I had been upgraded only to find out that I was placed in the handicapped room (the same category room as I had booked) with no bathtub. Since it was just my small son and I this absolutely would not work. It took hours to rectify and no real apology. Service by the family pool was totally inconsistent actually nonexistent. The spa was always booked so impossible to use that. Room service mixed up my order several times requests forgotten the list goes on..... Just too many slip ups for my liking in one weekend.

It is better to arrive and leave with luggages. (that's is truely a very personnal opinion). Riads can be more typical and traditionals but won't give you the confort we will find in Four Seasons.    Only single improvement point... Taxi in the lobby.. it is a mass in Marrocos and the hotel didn't help enough. (maybe share common fees and have dedicated taxi drivers waiting inside the hotel).,Date of stay: September 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Sao Paulo, SP",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Meduarda23
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,newyorker2011 wrote a review Sep 2015,50,Exceptional service,This was my first experience at a Four Seasons property and I can say that I would not want to stay at another resort again. The service was exceptional in  all aspects from the valet to the receptionists and the staff at the restaurants pool and spa. I would want to special mention the receptionist on duty at the  early morning of August 30 2015 Abdelaziz who helped me get the medicine for my daughter who got sick that morning after having too much to drink. He got a taxidriver who looked around for an open pharmacy at 2:00 am and got the medicine for my daughter. He was so concerned about my daughter's well-being that he even asked if she would need a doctor! Again this property deserves an overall rating of 5/5.,Date of stay: August 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Brookville, NY",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/newyorker2011

I have stayed in many four seasons across the world and this was just a horrible example of services. We were constantly waiting for things and were never given great service. It would often take 30 mins for the staff to clear a breakfast table in order for us to sit and another 10-15 minutes for a waiter to come over to the table with water. The room service wasn't delivered to our room at all on a few occasions as they ""forgot.""

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,pete66266 wrote a review Sep 2015,50,Your average family of 5 (2adult and 3 children ) staying 6nights,Your average Family of 5 (2adult and 3 children ) staying 6nights    This was our third stay at the FS marrakech and once again we had a memorable stay. The room was very nice (room 21). Right next to the pool and easy access from the entrance (good if you go out every evening and want to go straight to your room). However it was a ground floor room so you need to ensure the doors are all locked before you go and no veiws but still nice. We did have minor issues within the room (ie sink blocked toilet running and slidding door not correct size). After notifying staff at the front desk this was all sorted.    Free WiFi for WhatsApp and snapchat etc so the teens are well connected and works near the pool area too. Faster speed you need to pay    Breakfast is always good if you get bored ask the staff to make something different which may not be on the spread. Ie pancakes coffee drinks mango slices etc. We had Indian night one day which was good but would have liked to see more options on the menu rather than fixed meal. We had Moroccan night too with music and bellydancing. That was really good as we danced. Thinking about it they could have done something like that for the Indian night too ??    We had the fullboard (morning lunch and evening excluding drinks). To be honest this could have been a lot better. The kids menu is limited and not all healthy. Even adults menu is very limited. I don't think you can have it everyday for a week. Dessert was very limited which was disappointing. Two days we ate out and 'My Thai' was really good place to eat. We got the complementary hotel car (6pm-10pm) to there but you have to make your own way back. Be careful with the local scammers as they recognise the four seasons car and come up to you pretending to work for the hotel. This happened twice and I went with the story just to string them along lol. RE: food. I would like to mention that my daughter found a long piece of plastic in her icecream and a hair in her fruit. I recommended that they check their suppliers and have more control on hygine as the plastic could have been dangerous for younger kids. Hopefully this was 1 in a million ? I only mentioned the hair incident as it was badly handled. Ie the senior staff took the bowl and started to talk to another guest. My poor daughter had to get herself another bowl. On reflection I should have said something but was keeping the peace. So don't hold back as you are paying good money for the best in a hotel experience    My partner and daughter had a spar treatment. We kindly had a 25% discount voucher which helped with the cost. However for some reasons what's on their list was not available. Personally I didn't care but you can imagine what the ladies are like in the family :). Anyway the guest manager (Mohammed) was very tentative to our needs and without him sorting and listening to the issues we would have had a below average stay. We appreciate all his hard work and thank him personally.    We went to the Aqua fun water park which the kids loved. We took towels from the hotel (worth doing). The drinks and food are expensive there but OK. This was recommended by the concierge which again Thankyou FS    There is no English entertainment on the TV so either get DVDs from the market or bring your own. And Google translate does help when ordering something from room service :) . Overall room service was brilliant and no issues    Overall FS is a great hotel for a family. Its safe relaxing and all the staff are friendly. Especially the new guest relations manager Mohammed. Would I go with the full board? Yes if they increase their options ie Thai night Indian night Mexican night etc and more options for kids/pool lunch menu. Adding basic soft beverages would be good too Otherwise just stick to breakfast and eating out.    Also they have cut back on little things like nuts at the front desk fresh cold towel on arrival and no lemon water at the spar. However they are building a larger kids club which is even better for a family of our size. So you win some and lose some???    Ps - enjoy the market place and don't get putoff with some more of the aggressive sellers. We went everyday and had no major issue. Just be dominating (but not rude) and flow with the other tourist around.    hopefully we will come back once the kids club is developed and also combine it with the new FS at Casablanca.,Date of stay: September 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,birmingham,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pete66266
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,ElTat wrote a review Sep 2015,30,Not the usual four seasons standard,A real paradox; lovely buildings & grounds smashing pools & no lack of trying from the staff but somewhere it goes wrong & the hotel overall really misses the mark. Eg there seems to be confusion around their own menus restaurants and amenities; the Concierge is very hit and miss: sometimes you get a quick response sometimes you need to call several times and sometimes a request goes into a black hole; housekeeping are generally confused and couldn't seem to leave our daughters amenities in the room ignored Do Not Disturb signs and didn't understand their own services. The restaurants aside from Arancino are weak yet very expensive; uninspired bland food prevailed sadly. However the team by the kids pool and the Kids club staff are excellent and they saved our stay from disaster. The kids club is a godsend and our daughter could not wait to go each day. The pool team were thoughtful and really looked after everyone! Overall this experience is not what we would expect from the Four Seasons and the value just was not there.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,mehtab k wrote a review Sep 2015,40,Amazing but not perfect,I have many positives about this resort:  Great location  Beautiful grounds  Fantastic pool and spa  Great breakfast buffet  Lovely and friendly staff  Incredibly helpful    However we were here for a friend's wedding and the hotel was pretty much at capacity with not enough staff so the ball was dropped.    I'm not sure if it's because they had no more firm mattresses left but basically our mattress was rubbish and when I requested it to be changed (three times) for some resin it wasn't. This resulted in my husband suffering significant back pain which ruined the rest of our holiday.    The hotel was very professional and lived up to their reputation when it came to trying to make amends following our complaint when checking out. The best part was when they sent a driver to take us to the station and help us with our bags - which he did very proactively and it really was a huge help.    Everyone makes mistakes so I don't hold this against them (even though it did ruin the following leg of my holiday) and I would definitely go back knowing it would be even better.,Date of stay: September 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/107mehtabk

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,aliasb wrote a review Aug 2015,40,Very good...but service needs to be fixed,Having stayed at many Four Seasons most recently in Orlando this version fell short of the expectations that I had. It is though a very nice resort with beautiful gardens and water features.    The area if fell short was on service which in my experience at other resorts has been exceptional. Service at the restaurants and pool was very slow and in some cases non-existant in other words drinks not turning up at all. Otherwise here is my general review.    Rooms - I had a premier room which has pool views. The room was not as big as i would have liked but the balcony area was very generous. The rooms are not high tech but otherwise comfortable.    Pools - There are 2 pools a family pool and a adults only pool (did see a few kids in there though). The family pool is in 3 sections with 3 different depths for all ages. The only thing that I was disappointed with was there was no zero entry for small children. The pool for small kids also had a number of steps in the pool which I though was hazardous. There is also a pool in the kids club which was rarely used.    Restaurants: Innara - Moroccan/International - This restaurant also does an Indian night on Mondays which was very good. The lighting outside is very dim so much so we had to use our phones to see what we were eating and service was very slow and some items from the set menu did not appear.    Bleus - Wonderful outdoor setting around a central water feature serving up italian. Food was good pricey and portions small. Again service very slow and waiters almost never ask if more drinks are required when your glass is empty.    Azzera - Mainly used for lunch by the pool again good light options on the menu. In the evening they run a set menu with a choice of burgers. Didn't try that and never looked busy in the evening.    Solano - Breakfast is served here and they run a moroccan theme twice a week (fri and sat). Breakfast is ok but they do not have control of the flies in the restaurant. On one occasion there were about 20 flies over the cereals and I had to tell the waiter to do something about it.    Zest Bar - Rooftop bar that serves snacks did not eat here but visited occasionally for drinks. Again nice setting for sunset drinks.    Kids Club - Used on most days and they keep the kids entertained from 9-5 and also run a 7-9pm themed party 3 times a week which gives mums and dads a chance to eat in peace. Nabila from the kids club was very enthusiastic and made our kids feel very welcome.    Young adults centre - Away from the kids club which was a minor inconvenience but I believe they are joining the 2 together which will help families with older kids.    Wifi - the complimentary service does extend to the pool area which annoyed some people    Location - 5 mins from the airport and about 10 to the main square and about the same to the new town.    I did speak to the Guest Experience manager regarding my concerns and he took note with the service at the pool improving immediately but I fear the problems will persist. Service is a problem across the board and needs to be addressed for this to be regarded as a top Four Seasons.,Date of stay: August 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aliasb

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Ali Mak wrote a review Aug 2015,50,Left me Dazed!,"Four seasons    The staff here have done the Four Seasons brand proud.    Check-In: We were a group of 8 (part of a bigger wedding group of 90+) and were received with a very warm welcome. We were seated in the lobby and served delicious Moroccan tea whilst the resort manager checked us in. I didn't even realise this was a check-in process. Within no time we were shown to our rooms whilst being shown where to go for breakfast and where the pools were located.    Room: The room was fantastic. Well lit with great finishing and a large outdoor space for lounging. The bathroom area was huge with a great bath and shower with a further segregated toilet. There was plenty of storage so I didn't have to battle my wife for space for once.    Food: From breakfast to room service to poolside food...absolutely amazing. The chef(s) nailed it. One of the best Pasta Arabiattas I've had and I was always spoilt for choice at breakfast. It was a little pricey but expected at a 5* resort.    Service/Staff: Friendly polite efficient and carried a smile.    Check-Out: Swift and remedied all issues superbly which leads me to...    There were a few problems that did occur but the manner in which they were resolved should be of focus. 1) The service by the pool was fairly slow often only two staff members available. 2) Cabannas were being unofficially reserved and left unoccupied for hours at a time which was a bit annoying. 3) My bed mattress was very soft and upon three requests had not been changed. This led to a bit of a back problem and required treatment at the spa. 4) Other guests had signed my room number with their name and signature on two occasions for f&b (a genuine mistake)    Upon bringing this to the attention of the check-out clerk this is what happened:  1) All F&B was removed from my bill  2) All Spa treatments removed from my bill  3) Escorted to the train station with a chauffer to carry luggage all the way to my cabin.  4) Resort manager personally came to apologise and see us off.    In fairness I was only expecting an apology and realised the wedding was unexpected in the ""off-season"" so the hotel was admittedly understaffed. But to have made amends the way they did left me pleasantly surprised and made me feel valued.    I will most definitely be back at the Four Seasons in Marrakech...worth every penny/cent/dirham    Nb: My wife's review may be a little more grim as she feels she should not have had to put up with my aches and pains. *tsk tsk* Some women!",Date of stay: August 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrAliMak

This should have been rated as exceptional but I couldn't.    When you call for things they don't happen as they should. I think having whatever whenever as a benchmark at w hotels sets an expectation for excellence.    The food in the restaurants isn't good. And it's expensive. There is far better food to be had outside - though it's a pain getting outside with the hussle and rubbish taxis. We went to mai-Thai on our last evening which had good food at a fair price.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,stargazeypie wrote a review Aug 2015,30,Not nearly as perfect as it should be,Let's face it staying in a Four Seasons is an expensive exercise but one I was happy to try. I'm more of a Hyatt and Sheraton customer normally but for a long weekend in Marrakech I decided to try the Four Seasons. My expectations like the prices they charge were very high. The good bits are many; incredibly well designed rooms the most comfortable beds you will ever sleep in very attentive and faultless service an excellent spa and yet the little things that were so avoidable and wrong really infuriated me.  One day a beer for my son and myself ordered by the pool took 20 minutes and arrived warm in 37 degree heat. The crisps that accompanied them were stale. The replacements took another 15 minutes and then only because I'd asked yet again where they were.  A request for a pepper mill at the pool restaurant led to six attempts including a pepper mill arriving full of ground white pepper. Three were given to me empty.  The service at lunch by the pool was incredibly slow.  At breakfast we had two peppers on our table one morning and no salt. I asked for an Americano and didn't get any hot milk with it. Small things but not what you expect in a hotel chain of this cailbre.  My son's bath plug didn't work even after repeated attempts by both of us to get it to do the job of keeping water in.  The bathrooms don't have small bottles of branded toiletries which are so lovely but big bottles which were re filled daily with who knows what something I think is so penny pinching and usually only seen in cheaper chains.  There were no pens in the rooms by the phones only pencils which everyone hates using. All going to show even in one of the most expensive hotel chains in the world costs appear to be being cut.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,robbiefan wrote a review Aug 2015,40,"Good in many respects, but not perfect...",This is perhaps one of the more difficult reviews to write; the bottom line is that a lot of things were very good indeed here but a few niggles and some experiences of bad service make me reluctant to give it an excellent rating. I think the stand out feature was the time effort and energy the staff expended in trying to put things right when problems occurred and this is to their credit. However in a 5 star hotel these problems should not occur in the first place.    There were many positive elements to this hotel. It is smaller than other Four Seasons resorts I have visited and as it was low season the hotel appeared to be fairly quiet. Our bedroom was pleasant and the beds were exceptionally comfortable. We heard no noise at all from our room despite overlooking the outdoor terrace of the restaurant and the air conditioning was effective. I also appreciated having tea and coffee making facilities.    The public ares of the hotel are beautiful and as mentioned in other reviews the flower arrangements are stunning. The hotel itself felt welcoming and friendly and as a mother and teenage daughter travelling without the rest of our family we appreciated this relaxed atmosphere. A significant number of staff were very pleasant indeed and one or two people really went out of their way to make us feel at home. On returning to the hotel after trips out we always felt a sense of calm and comfort.    However all too often the excellent service was in response to a problem. Unfortunately the service at the pool restaurant was poor but to be fair to the management we were not expected to pay the full bill when problems arose.    Most of the time we spent at the hotel during the day was spent by the pool and this was perhaps the least satisfactory part of the hotel experience. Firstly it is worth noting that there are 2 pools one a family pool and the other what I believed to be an adults - only pool. We based ourselves at the 'adult' pool but on our last day there were a few children in the pool. When I asked a member of staff about this I was told that it is in fact a 'quiet pool' and can be used by families if they are not noisy. However this does change the atmosphere I believe and I think an adults only policy would be better. By the way the conduct of a number of adults did leave a little to be desired. A particular group of women fuelled by bottles of wine were very rowdy indeed and seemed oblivious to the looks of other guests. I did find some days quieter and more relaxing than other days and I don't know what it must be like during high season.    Another issue at the pool was the lack of umbrellas. For maybe 30 or 35 beds or so I counted a total of 6 umbrellas which was completely inadequate. On one particular day it was extremely hot and as there were 2 umbrella bases next to my bed I asked for an umbrella so that I could have some shade. I was told there were no more available and when I asked why there were 2 empty bases next to the bed I was told that the umbrellas were broken. If they are broken then why are they not replaced? I was told to go into a cabana for shade but they are airless and stuffy and I did not want to do that. Eventually a malfunctioning umbrella was positioned next to my bed. This really is an area which needs to be addressed.    On our first trip down to the pool we arrived about 5pm to find a lot of beds covered with used and discarded towels which had not been cleared; this gave the area an untidy appearance and did not create a great impression. On subsequent days used dirty glasses were left at the pool edge. Having said this the staff often greeted me by name and were helpful and pleasant. I did not feel that there was much of a feeling of outdoor space. The pool areas were a little crowded with rows of beds alongside each other and there were no lawns on which to have sunbeds.    I had arranged for a transfer from the airport provided by the hotel. It was ridiculously expensive compared with the cost of a local taxi (£40 each way compared with £5 for a local taxi) but it was nice to be met by someone from the hotel and to travel in an air conditioned Mercedes.    Breakfast was another disappointment. I usually enjoy 5 star hotel breakfasts and believe them to be good value. However the breakfast here was more than £20 per head and yet one had to pay extra for items which are usually included as part of the buffet for instance pancakes. There is no option to have just a continental breakfast although there is if you order room service. On our first morning I had a small continental breakfast and my daughter had 2 pancakes and the bill was about £31 which I thought was particularly bad value. We therefore chose to go out for breakfast the remaining days and spend the money on lunch at the hotel instead. Le Cafe de la Poste was particularly nice and much better value.    We ate at Arancino the Italian restaurant which was pleasant although the menu was a little limited (excellent service however). We ate out the remaining evenings the best evening spent at Le Comptoir. I wasn't keen on Bo Zin which tried too hard to be cool and La Trattoria De Giancarlo which was recommended by the hotel was not great.    By the way if you are intending to visit Jamaa el Fna do read the reviews on this website and take time to research online the most common scams in Marrakech.    I began by saying this was a difficult review to write. I don't think I would return to Marrakech in a hurry and the hotel while nice is not enough to entice me back. Yet again I end up drawing comparisons with the Emirates Palace in Abu Dhabi; as a destination Abu Dhabi is not the most exciting place to visit. However it is the hotel which entices us back again and again. I feel inconsistency is the main characteristic of this Four Seasons property; there is much which is excellent but other areas let it down.,Date of stay: August 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,oxfordshire,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robbiefan

The moment we arrived at our hotel we felt very relaxed. The Four season were very organised we had booked 3 deluxe rooms and they had all our rooms next to each other on the ground floor.    When checking in the staff took us directly to the lobby area to sit down and they would bring any papers that needed signing to us there was no standing or waiting around. We were served Morroccon tea with nuts dried fruit and dates.    The rooms were cleaned daily staff were very helpful and clean.    I did not book a treatment in the spa but did use the jacuzzi and sauna which I really enjoyed. The only thing that disappointed me in the spa was the the steam room it did not steam up. The staff said it automatically goes on & off but while I sat there was nothing. The spa was clean and very relaxing.    The kids enjoyed playing tennis. The gym had all the basic equipment for cardio. I liked for those who wanted to do weight training it was in a seperate room and there were many different equipments to use    The hotel was peaceful calm and relaxing I would definatly go back there again,Date of stay: August 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FifiAziz
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Laura K wrote a review Jul 2015,30,Lovely hotel but beware of some staff,We visited the Four Seasons for four nights in July 2015.    Firstly an expensive scarf/shawl disappeared from my suitcase during our stay – this is not something I would expect to happen at a hotel of this standard. I emailed the hotel and they responded as if I had lost the scarf even though I didn't take it out of my suitcase for the duration of our stay. They said they had checked lost property but they did not say they would look into the theft.    Secondly we had a disagreement with a taxi driver at the entrance to the hotel – a member of staff was standing by but did nothing. As two girls travelling alone I would expect the staff to help guests in a situation like this (we had pre-agreed a price but this didn’t seem to matter to this particular taxi driver).    If it wasn’t for these incidents I wouldn’t have a bad word to say about this hotel. The majority of staff are attentive and friendly. I requested to change the room from a double to a twin and my request was fulfilled. We did have an issue with the card entry system to our room during our stay but this was promptly resolved. We ate in the pool side restaurant a few times and ordered room service – all the food was lovely. We used the hotel to exchange currency and the exchange rate they offered was very good. The pool area was beautiful the staff would walk around a few times a day offering water tasters of fruit juices and asking if you’d like your sunglasses cleaned.    We got a taxi to and from the airport – it’s a 5-10 minute drive and shouldn’t cost any more than 70 dirhams but the taxi drivers can be very stubborn. When we arrived the taxi driver initially wanted to charge us 150 dirhams to the hotel and wouldn’t budge.    Before visiting the medina I would advise you research scams in Marrakech as we saw it happen.. A LOT! We were scammed on our first night by a henna lady they use intimidation and can be scary after this incident we researched scams and didn’t let it put us off.    Overall I enjoyed our stay however it’s a shame that a member of staff can ruin our first experience of the Four Seasons. As a result I wouldn’t return.,Date of stay: July 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/16LauraK
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Pip1807 wrote a review Jul 2015,50,Best hotel in Marrakech,I stayed at the Four Seasons Marrakech for 5 nights from July 23rd with 2 girl friends.    Upon arrival from the airport (which took 10 mins by hotel arranged car for 600 mad - although a taxi would have cost us about 100mad it is worth doing as the taxis are so old like clapped out tin cans and you probably wouldn't get your luggage in them anyway) we were warmly greeted by reception and whisked to our room without having to deal with boring check in admin. (we had an hour long wait at border control in the airport at arrivals as the systems were down) so we were grateful to get to our room quickly and refresh. The day we arrived it was 52 degrees!    The hotel was quiet due to it being the low season but we did not mind as we wanted a relaxing holiday - however people watchers may be a bit disappointed as there was little action around the hotel all holiday.    The hotel was beautifully decorated with modern and Moroccan theme with fresh pink roses everywhere.    Our room was large on the 4th floor overlooking the centre of the hotel with 2 large singles and an extra bed for our third guest. We had a walk in wardrobe large balcony big bathroom with bath tub and separate loo and shower. We had a table and chairs in the room which was nice as we ordered room service breakfast on some days. The only downfall in the room was the tv channels were not great but we did not spend any time in the room other than to get changed.    The cleaning service was excellent and they turned our beds down every evening giving us fresh bottles of water and slippers. The whole room was completely tidied with all our clothes folded. They even left us book marks for our books!    Breakfast offered a large choice of fresh fruit and croissants with some hot food as well although I was not that fussed about this (there are no pork sausages so watch out boys!) The breakfast although very high quality I felt was extremely expensive at 30 euros per day and not worth the money. I often just ordered a la carte which is more reasonable. Breakfast for 3 daily was 1050 mad.    We visited the Italian restaurant twice. The menu was a little limited I would have liked to have seen more options however the food was good. (you have to bare in mind that the food is never going to be top level London restaurant but perfectly acceptable - I have very high standards). The actual décor of the restaurant was good - we ate outside both times. We would have liked a bit more ambience -it was very quiet. Music would have helped and in general we noticed everywhere around the hotel there was no music including the pool area. This would have much improved our experience.    The pool was excellent. The sun loungers very high quality and they give you fresh towels. There is a bar service at your sun lounger and they bring complimentary water and little treats such as mango juice and strawberry milkshake which were nice touches. Our waiters at the pool were exceptional and really made our stay! The hotel pool I believe is the best I have seen on my many trips and certainly the best in Marrakech. Cocktails were approx. 160 mad which is about £10. There is a pool restaurant which serves pizzas burgers salads and lots of other options- all good quality similar to a Bistro restaurant like Cote Brasserie.    I visited the spa with a friend and had a full body massage. This was a good massage and worth doing. If you book through Expedia you get 25% off all spa bookings.    I would definitely recommend this hotel if you can afford it. When I say that I mean the restaurants and drinks are fairly pricy so you need to be ok with that - it is Four Seasons after all.    In summary service was exceptional cleanliness exceptional décor and facilities exceptional food and restaurants nice - a little expensive. Best hotel in Marrakech.    Extra tips- we visited Jad Mahal and Bo Zin for dinner. Jad Mahal average food very dark difficult to see what you are eating but excellent live entertainment whilst eating so worth the experience. They also have live band for after dinner. Bo Zin was an exceptional looking restaurant with good menu a little out of town. Worth a visit but don't order red meat unless you have a strong stomach. We also had lunch outside at the Mamounia which is quite a famous hotel. You should visit the souks around 11.30 or late at night eg 8pm. Be careful at night often very crowded and you will get bothered by shop owners. Do NOT wear expensive things dress down and keep your shoulders covered.    If you can afford it take private cars ordered by hotel everywhere. Local taxis readily available but not particularly safe. 50 mad to the medina from hotel instead of 400 mad by private air conditioned car - mercedes. Most don't have seat belts.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,umamaheshb wrote a review Jul 2015,50,Extra ordinary service even during stress,Room: pavilion suite. Stayed: 6-13 July 2015  The resort is excellent and I don't need to say that as it's been said many times in other reviews. I want to mention some special stuff we experienced  1. The care and attention of people and there service culture is the best I have seen till now.  2. The main Moroccan restaurant is awesome. We went during Ramadan and the Iftar dinners were too good. We all put on weight.  3. Service under stress. We had an accident when a wax candle tripod fell on our little ones hair. The reaction of the staff and the attention given were first class. The star of the show was Lina. Her attention to our little one and solving the problem was outstanding,Date of stay: July 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/umamaheshb
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,RobbertSeidemann wrote a review Jul 2015,50,Day visitor receiving VIP treatment,Hi just would like to thank the team of the pool area for adults (no children zone). We came as 'day guests' and were truly treated as VIP guests. Such a great hospitality strategy that we will visit the Fours Seasons for sure again. We were welcomed by 'Rachid' who was taking care of us from the start but also the other members from the restaurant made our 'one day experience' into something very exclusive. We felt spoiled.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,JPAP-SHLC wrote a review Jul 2015,50,"Super break, a few hiccups, but we will be back.",We were unsure whether this hotel would live up to the usual four seasons standards having enjoyed some of our best holidays and special occasions with the chain in some of their flagship resorts.    We only had one issue which nearly resulted in a loss of a star - that was the internet. The Wifi (the premium one not the slow one) was terrible in the resort in particular around the adult/quiet pool where my fiancee and I just couldn't get strong enough signal to pick up work e-mails. We ended up racking up about £120 in phone data fees to save us having to go to and from the room. They really really really need to ensure their Wifi coverage is sufficient across the resort.    The staff were generally superb and in line with other four seasons hotels we have stayed in Ali at the front desk in particular was brilliant. Management were hands on and whilst the Italian meal we had was about 6 times the price of the superb Trattoria it really is reflected in the polished manager led service which you just can't find elsewhere in Morocco.    We went to Richard Bransons resort in the Atlast Mountains (Kasbah Tamadot) on a day trip (well worth doing - take your swimming and tennis stuff and enjoy a full day there) - and whilst it is stunning in a more natural quirky way the facilities staff and food just doesn't compare to the four seasons.    The hotel was pretty safe a very secure compound and the only hotel in the city (so we are told) which checks each car for bombs.    As others have said the hotel taxi pick-up is extortionate 6 minute drive from the airport made it the single most expensive taxi ride I have had anywhere in the world by a long way (on a £/mile basis). We will pre-book with a separate company next time.    The SPA was probably the nicest I have ever seen the first one to better The SPA at Pennyhill Park. Male and Female facilities are completely separate. My partner had a very disappointing massage she wasn't informed it would be with a male masseuse and was a bit surprised and felt uncomfortable during the treatment (even though he was very professional) had it not been mostly complementary we would have complained - they really ought to advice this in advance.    The rooms and facilities were faultless and the breakfast was very good service around the pool was perfect. We enjoyed 5 very relaxing nights here and enjoyed having a stunning hotel resort and being able to dip in and out of the busy city whenever we wanted. With cheap flights from the UK getting us there in under 4 hours we are sure we will become regular guests for short stays and are already planning a 30th birthday there for next year.,Date of stay: July 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JPAP-SHLC

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,rachel1180 wrote a review Jul 2015,50,Pool and spa day at Four Seasons,We visited the Four Seasons to use the pool and spa while staying in the Medina in July when it was over 40 degrees. It is not a cheap option but you get what you pay for and I cannot recommend this hotel enough! It is only a short distance outside the Medina (less than 50dh in a taxi to get there but charged a premium to get back so would be worth arranging a pick-up rather than using Four Seasons taxi). The pool pass includes lunch spa is extra and quite expensive but also worth it as you can use the facilities before and after treatments. We also paid to use the pool at Les Jardins de la Koutoubia and the experience was very different. Although we were not hotel guests the staff were exceptional. Mahdi had no problem in arranging iftar instead of lunch (as we were fasting Ramadan) and Houda in the spa was delightful and attentive. I can't remember the names of the therapists but both my friend and I felt the massages were the best we'd ever had staff were ultra-professional and the spa facilities are excellent. Towels loungers and sunscreen are provided by the fantastic large swimming pool which is situated in beautiful grounds. Public wifi was not usable by the pool but good in other areas. Quality of food (buffet) and service in the restaurant was high. I obviously can't comment on the rooms but I hope to return as a guest at this hotel in the future - definitely a 5* experience which can be variable in Morocco.,Date of stay: July 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,Sheffield,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rachel1180
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Alahaik wrote a review Jul 2015,40,What a jewel!,I truly loved this beautiful resort. The service is impeccable in terms of genuineness and attitude. People are always smiling and willing to assist you.  Maybe they should improve the concierge service: the lady that booked a table for us at the club said us to get there too early and no one was there at that time.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Rest&Co wrote a review Jul 2015,50,Beautiful grounds!,The resort is set on beautiful grounds with exceptional scenery and beautiful pool areas. The bar views at the Solano bar is also gorgeous.  The rooms are a little on the dark side even the luxury level rooms have very little open view which makes them a little dark. The condition of the room was ok but I wished the carpet and furniture were a little more modern. Overall experience was good with an exceptional concierge service. The resort gave us a good break from the hustle and bustle of the city of Marrakech since we did wonder off to the city using the recommended Abercrombie and Kent service from the hotel  The wifi by the adults pool was very slow so this is something hotel needs to improve on.,Date of stay: July 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Krakow, Poland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Glossy13
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Rob Jupp wrote a review Jul 2015,50,Utterly Amazing!,We have just returned from a 3 night stay at the Four Seasons Marrakech. I am a regular visitor of 5 Star Hotels around the Globe and would add that this is a contender for the very best hotel I have ever visited.    It all started badly. The Hotel arranged driver wasn't at the airport to meet us on our arrival. I phoned the hotel rather angrily and within 10 minutes a replacement driver was there. When we arrived at the hotel a team was waiting for us to take us directly to our room to prevent any further inconvenience. The hotel insisted on taking the transfer off out bill. Things will always go wrong however good the hotel but it's what the hotel does about it that shines through good or bad. Their response was text book out of the good customer service book.    We booked a Pavilion Suite which came complete with a good size plunge pool.the rooms was fantastic. The bed was so comfortable.    We eat in the three restaurants. Italian very good Moroccan (Buffet) ok but no labelling on much of the food so you didn't really know what you were eating and anyone with food allergies would struggle. On the final night the hotel arranged for us to have our own table on the balcony with rose petals and candles. So romantic and so thoughtful and a lovely way to spend our anniversary.    We had breakfast in our room every day and it was amazing. A table on our balcony was laid and it felt like the most perfect way to start a day.    The grounds of the hotel are simply beautiful. So many herbs creating a rich bouquet of smells. The hotel has 2 swimming pools one for adults and one for families. We spent the day in the family one as it was bigger and seemed really quiet.    Our stay could have been effected by a large L'Oreal Conference with lots of young people who it appeared were not use to such surrounds. The hotel did a pretty good job of protecting the non conference guests but some of their behaviour may have proved too much for some.    Overall this hotel should be on a 'must visit.' The customer service experience was fantastic and we will defiantly return again.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,5KPK wrote a review Jul 2015,50,"Exceptional service, beautiful and peaceful hotel",Not only is this a beautiful property well maintained and appointed the service and helpfulness of all staff is better than we've ever experienced anywhere. We stayed for five nights for my husbands birthday and were treated to cake and champagne delivered to the room while we were out which was a very pleasant surprise. We stayed during Ramadan and thus enjoyed the most amazing Iftar meal at the resort -- what a tremendous treat and an amazing value. The food at the hotel is superb and the staff make this hotel experience the very best it can be.    We were very happy they have a very large and beautiful adult pool (we prefer peace and quiet). The property is so peaceful green lush and a perfect retreat after the hectic nature of being in the Medina. The doormen were incredibly helpful with taxis and making sure we didn't get overcharged which is so common in Marrakech.    We chose a Premium room with king bed. The room was very large with a huge bathroom (with separate toilet room) tub large shower double sinks. We also had a nice walk-in closet with plenty of hanging and drawer space.    The room had a very large balcony with a view of the adult pool and the fountains if it weren't so hazy we could have seen the mountains but only saw a slight outline. The balcony had two chaise lounges plus a table with two chairs and still plenty of extra room. The bed was incredibly comfortable the climate control was quiet and perfect. We slept very peacefully there.    What will stay in our memories is how perfect the staff are. This was the best service we've ever experienced and were so impressed by everyone.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,BB1425 wrote a review Jul 2015,50,"Excellent stay, would highly recommend",The Four Seasons Resort was one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at the staff made us feel welcome from start to finish. The room was very big and had all the modern technology you require the wifi quality was the best I have seen in a hotel the signal strength even around the pool was great. The pools are excellent with an adults pool and childrens one the gym was very well equipped with a big cardio room weights room and tennis courts and the gym staff were always keen to help whenever possible even making sure you drank enough water. The only down side for us was the food but generally in Marrakech we did not find the food to be great. The hotel is around ten minutes from the airport but you wouldn't even know you were near the airport. Taxi's to and from the airport was around 500 MAD around £4 and the same price into the city centre.,Date of stay: June 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Bedfordshire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BB1425
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,holiday333 wrote a review Jul 2015,50,Tranquil Property,We have just returned from a 4 night stay at this lovely hotel that is so peaceful and relaxing outside the madness of the Medina.    From my initial contact with Reservations they were extremely helpful and accommodated my requests perfectly. Communication was excellent with emails arriving instantly to confirm arrangements.  We stayed in 2 Pavilion Rooms which were interconnecting.    Unfortunately on arrival (we had booked a Transfer through the hotel) we came through and there was no Driver to meet us. Luckily the Driver from La Mamounia came to our assistance and called the hotel to sort the problem.  We then had to wait 15 minutes for our car - When it did arrive we were absolutely horrified at the state of the Range Rover Sport that collected us - It was literally falling apart broke down twice on the way to the hotel - luckily this is only a 10 minute journey...  The hotel were very apologetic for the situation but in my experience staying with other FS Hotels this did not go far enough . The charge was removed for the car as it well should have been.    We were welcomed nicely in the hotel and provided with refreshing Mint Tea during the check in process which was seamless.    The rooms were excellent - very spacious modern and clean. 1 Room had a balcony and the other room had a lovely sun terrace with loungers plus a balcony.  In room amenities were good but lacking a nespresso machine or alike - just an old fashioned kettle and sachets of instant.  Beds are very comfortable and rooms are air conditioned plus a ceiling fan.  Wardrobe space plenty housed in a walk in closet.    Breakfast - Buffet - Nice selection laid out and plentiful and things to satisfy most nationalities.    Pool - we used the adults pool daily which is large with plenty of sun loungers. Everywhere is clean and the pool area also offers cabanas should you wish to stay out of the searing sun.  The Pool service is efficient but very different to other FS stayed in. The Pool man greets you and arranges towels as you would expect but then you are delivered a glass of water . All other FS I have stayed in bring you a small cool box with bottled water iced flannels and some evian face spray.  It was not a problem to get a new glass of water - when you could find the pool attendant to ask ...  I will however mention it was Ramadam whist we were there so this may have had an impact on the service levels.  The whole hotel was very quiet.    Inara Bar& Lounge - Very pleasant area just off the lobby that serves good cocktails and will seem to make anything you ask for. Very pleasant staff who were very attentive.    Rooftop bar - We tried to go for a drink here after dinner one evening to find it was closed.    We did not eat in the restaurants within the hotel but they looked good.    The hotel is about a 10/15 min ride into the square/Medina so is well located and taxis are cheap.    If you are looking for a relaxing hotel with good levels of service you will not be disappointed in your stay here.,Date of stay: June 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/holiday333

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Familytraveller1982 wrote a review Jul 2015,50,Fantastic!!,The thing that makes this hotel great is the staff. What a wonderful experience and place.    The concierge suggested some excellent places and tours. The only negative I would say is the steam rooms where not up to the standard I would expect from FS but it could be because Hammam Spa do not get as hotel as regular steam rooms.    The roof top bar is a must the views are great and they even provide complimentary snack.    It's not necessary to go a room with a view as all views are good it just depends on what you like! We visited other hotel (la mamunia and royal mansoor) for drinks / dinner. The mamunia was great and felt like a Moroccan palace but the four seasons was still our preference. The grounds are great for walks and the adult pool was perfect for a swim or just relaxing in the sun!

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Kyera S wrote a review Jul 2015,50,Stunning Hotel,First time we have stayed at a Four Seasons Hotel and will not be the last. It's a brand you hear a lot about and we were not disappointed. Flight from Gatwick to Marrakech with BA was just over 3 hours and the 10 minute car transfer means you are very quickly and officially 'on holiday'. This Hotel was faultless stunning design spotlessly clean discreet yet attentive staff. Beautifully furnished interiors and exteriors (not so keen on the caged Love Birds in the lobby) there was a lot of lovely bird song from the wild birds outside. The room we booked was a deluxe double and it was spacious with a huge super comfy bed a walk in closet wonderful bathroom and lovely balcony. The aircon was quiet the lighting was really well designed and everything was of a high quality. Lots of luxury bathroom supplies and of course lovely robes and slippers. Our room was on floor 3 over looking the gardens so very quiet and pretty view. Room service was great we used for breakfast mainly served on the balcony. It was my 50th birthday while we were staying and some nice treats were left in our room on the afternoon roses fizz cake and cards a very nice touch although I was unsure who to thank for this - but 'Thank Your' Four Seasons! We spent most of our time relaxing around the pool which was blissful great pool service and the water was perfect. The spa treatments we had were fabulous. The gift shop is lovely if a little pricey. The Zest roof top bar is perfect for sundowners I recommend the 'Medina Fizz' and my husband loved the 'Casablanca' bottled beer also the Sports bar was superb a total 'man zone'. The restaurants were lovely great locations and furnishings. Food was superb at every meal and plenty of it however I didn't eat meat on this trip in order to avoid eating Halal. Although we stayed during Ramadan our visit was pretty much unaffected by this. We had a guide 'Feta' who took us into town a short taxi ride away and showed us the area. Old palaces back streets new developments the souks and medina etc. It was good to have him or we would probably be wandering around lost still! We came away with a couple of things but our lack of bartering skills meant we probably paid way too much. Although it was June the heat was a dry heat so it never felt oppressive or uncomfortable and no mosquitos maybe the season or the spraying that's done? We have stayed in some amazing Hotels and have pretty high expectations so we would really recommend this Hotel for a luxury trip to Marrakech it's away from the chaos of Town you really won't want to leave.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Richard M wrote a review Jun 2015,50,An oasis away from the bedlam,We have just arrived home from the Four Seasons Hotel and what a great place it is.  Let me start from the beginning. When you arrive at Marrakech airport make sure you keep your boarding pass for customs. You have to fill out an entry form for customs and show them the boarding pass as well. Everyone was greeted with a surly look no please thanks or kiss my butt. Awful procedure and very haphazard. Nevertheless you are through and on your way to the hotel. We opted for the safe pick up from the hotel which we pre booked. Yes it is expensive but the driver is waiting for you with a board takes your cases to the Range Rover or whatever you have booked aircon on and away you go no hassle. The choice is yours. You could come out of the airport and be accosted by waiting cabbies all desperate for your business and I know some are not real either. If you do this make sure you say 'how much to the four seasons?' and whatever they answer suggest 50 or 70 dirhams no more. If they argue move to the next one. Do not get ripped off. It is just a ten minute journey. We paid for the cheauffeur option as I say maybe next time and now we are aware of the downside we may go for the non aircon non seatbelt cab!  We arrive at the hotel. Stunning. As you are driving along you pass a lot of dirt dust and un finished buildings and then come across this gated and high security hotel The Four Seasons. Then you think how lucky you are to be staying there. As you are taken from the car the cases are taken from you and you are checked in whilst sipping the mint tea. The corridors are all lit with lights and lanterns (at night) all air con and beautiful smells and aromas everywhere. Once booked in you are taken or driven to your room/ villa by a golf buggy depending on how far (though you never need it again). The rooms are large and comfortable bathrooms beautiful with a deep tub as well as a rain forest shower. We paid extra for the pavilion room very near the pool and a lovely balcony overlooking the pool with sun beds on. There are two pools one for family and the other adults only. We resided in the adults only daily. Sun cream on tap along with some magazines helpful and courteous staff around the pool for drinks and snacks no problems getting a sunbed when and where you want it and the pool awesome large and similar to indian stone tiles not the standard neon chavvy blue thus a feel of quality and luxury. there is a restaurant open until sunset at the end of the pool great drinks and food. yes a bit more expensive but at your feet no need to go anywhere.  They have three other restaurants the italian a tall building in the middle of the complex. Beautiful italian food. No side dishes were mentioned but we asked for a salad and that was no problem. Sometimes the food lacked a bit of spice but this seems to be the norm in Morocco. (I will be reviewing two restaurants outside of the hotel Cafe de la poste and Le Foundouk both of which you could only describe as edible nice but bland food). My own opinion is that the menu seems limited but when you ask they say they will cook what you want. Maybe hotel management should make this clearer and could possibly encourage further diners. Then there is the Moroccan buffet nightly. A great feast set out overlooking all the fountains and lanterns at night. I am not sure if this is just for Ramadan but seemed to be a crowd pleaser. Above this and near reception is a small international restaurant/ lounge. Sit outside or in good selection of food and lovely views. Again there was a 'pop up' restaurant one evening for a Bombay night which we only found out about on the night maybe management should look at promoting these events at turn down in each room or other ways? All of the food we had was lovely everyone so polite a far cry from eating outside the hotel. Yes it is more expensive the drinks are quite dear to but you can choose to get a cab elsewhere like we did on occasions (concierge more than happy to supply a list of good restaurants) but when you eat out you realise how happy you are to come back. It is an experience not to be missed outside of the hotel but I cannot say whole heartedly that we felt safe all the time especially having cab drivers who put their seatbelts over the back of their seats so it doesnt get in their way no crash helmets on a lot of mopeds and on children too a lack of road sense and signs I could go on. And as for the souks and main square an eye opener!!  My last thing about the Four Seasons was the Spa. My wife had the Hamann treatment day one and thought it was awesome the best ever. I had two massages over the five days and both sent me to sleep at times. A fantastic experience.  The staff everywhere seem to want to help you and look after you. Everyone is very polite and courteous from Salma at Concierge to Mohammed at the pool to name but two. The 'suits' also mingle with the guests but could possibly do that even more.  All in all this hotel is brilliant. In any city you would be pleased to stay there but in Marrakech you realise you have hit jackpot. As the saying goes you get what you pay for and I honestly cannot praise this high enough.  Will we go again yes.

We loved the hotel the opulence and the gardens were beautiful. We also enjoyed the spa and I experienced a traditional moroccan bath. My Hamman was very relaxing and I felt refreshed. The grounds are well maintained and a nice place to stroll and get away from the hustle and bustle of the city. The breakfast was delightful especially since you can ennoy the garden and pool view while enjoing your breakfast.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,AntariF wrote a review Jun 2015,50,Thoroughly enjoyed our stay here,"From checking in up to checking out we felt so welcome in this fab resort. We stayed in room 227 the room was big enough for 3 people the bathroom was big had a big deep bath and a big shower room. The toilet was an intelligent one: heats up the seat a button to lift the seat washing and drying buttons. And if you forget to flush it it flushes itself afterwards.    Anyway location fantastic lots of trees/plants and when you open the sliding door to the porch all you can hear is birds chirping away which was lovely.    If you wanted to use the mini bar for your own food they'll be glad to empty it for you.    The swimming pools and whirlpools are beautiful and pretty quiet in the mornings. The staff at the swimming pool are very helpful they will get parasol for you if your sun bed doesn't have one they will go around offering to clean your sunglasses.    Food is quite expensive - we only had breakfast there and there's a good selection of food so it caters for everybody's taste.    Standard Wifi is very good so no need to upgrade.    Concierge is very helpful will do all the bookings you ask them to do. Mind you they seem to try to dissuade you from booking a place which are not on their ""list"" but if you tell them that's what you want don't let them stop you.    If you could help it don't use the hotels airport pick up service it cost a fortune and the hotel is only 10 minutes away if that.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,markc913Midlands wrote a review Jun 2015,50,Whit week breal,We recently stayed at this hotel for 4 nights at the end of May. When we arrived we were welcomed with a refreshing mint tea and informed we had been upgraded to a Pavilion Suite which was spacious and clean with a terrace area with its own plunge pool.  The adults only pool at the hotel was fantastic  very quiet and the pool attendant kept us supplied with complimentary drinks and nibbles.  We ate twice at the Italian restaurant  Arancinos  and the food on both occasions was excellent  if a little on the pricey side.  The cost of alcohol in the bars was very expensive  for example a bottle of beer and a glass of local wine would set you back £14.  On the last night we decided to eat at a local Riad and asked at reception for their advice they gave us details of a number of restaurants organised the reservation for us with a taxi taking us straight to the door .  We also needed a late check out which was organised with no problems  and was much appreciated.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,SteffHunterH wrote a review Jun 2015,50,Excellent introduction to the hippest city in Morocco,On our first trip to Morocco there was no better introduction than a stay in the Four Seasons resort. The hotel was everything we have come to expect from the chain - luxury with a local twist very responsive and knowledgeable service and courtesy that goes beyond the call of duty.    We loved the little touches - Moroccan mint tea on arrival the chirping birds in the gardens and the exotic local touches without being over the top.    They took care of everything - down to getting nano SIM cards for us and topping up the value. The spa was also a lovely experience.    If we had one grouse it was that the weather was too hot in early June and walk from the room to the spa seemed too long in the heat. But even the Four Seasons cannot control the weather.

The lobby is not cluttered by check-in desks and concierge counters They are in a separate area. The rooms offer a large bedroom and very comfortable bed off which is a large bathroom with twin basins separate shower and toilet. The dressing room / walk-in wardrobe offers more than enough space to satisfy the most fashion concious travellers. The balcony is big enough to relax on in comfort and has an attractive brick built-in lounging seat as well as table & chairs.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,NarjisO wrote a review May 2015,50,An amazing experience!,"I can't thank enough the Four seasons' team for their warm welcome their help whenever needed and their courtesy at all times. From the start smiles were all around. Starting with the very courteous valet and bell man who escorted us to the lobby where we were greeted with a nice cup of tea and had a very smooth check in the lobby's living room (which actually didn't feel like a regular hectic check in).    The fragrance in the lobby was just right subtle but really good.    The room was pretty spacious with a nice balcony a large bathroom and the best.... a walk in closet with an easy to use safe.    We interacted with the front desk room service valet and concierge on a regular basis and I can tell you that we had the best experience ever. They were always ready to help!! I actually do not remember ever hearing a ""NO"" when we were there.    By the pool a gentleman by the name of Abdel (I believe it was Abderrazk) helped us a great deal. He managed to get us two cabanas brought the long chairs and covered them for us in no time. He was also very handy with the first aid kit when I scratched myself (really minor) which I appreciated. I just had to say that I hurt myself and next thing I knew he was there with the first aid kit.    We also had an amazing time at the spa very relaxing and the service again was impeccable. We tried the Hammam and got a massage after we weren't rushed at all and we had a nice tea after the Hammam (while waiting for the masseuse) and when we were done.    Bottom line I highly recommend this hotel as we really felt like we were in a friend's place rather than a stuck up and intimidating hotel.    Thank you for making our memorial day weekend in Marrakech memorable!!    Special thanks to :    Abderrahim Badr and Ali from Reception  Aicha and Houda from the spa  Mouhcine at the door  The room service team    We definitely plan on making the Four Seasons our spot in Marrakech!",Date of stay: May 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"West Orange, New Jersey",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NarjisO

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,MpHav wrote a review May 2015,50,The Four Seasons at Its Best,The problem with staying at the Four Seasons is that you never want to leave and explore and that was the case here. The food the service the pool the gardens the bar -- all are perfect.    Our room/villa was especially amazing with our own small patio and plunge pool. Loved it!    A special note about the service... We were there on a group trip and my husband missed lunch because he was working. We went to the kitchen about 30 minutes after lunch had finished up but we were hoping my husband would be able to get a small bite to eat. He explained the situation to the manager and asked for a small plate of hummus and tabouli with some bread. The manager would not hear of it! He sat us down and served my husband plate and plate of amazing kabobs and rice and salad and vegetables and... on and on.

If I was to make a negative comment and give some feedback I would say the Italian restaurant is really under selling it's self - the weather wasn't great with a few showers - all the other restaurants got back to business and opened up outside - 3 times we tried to sit outside the Italian and they were only open inside so we went to one of the other bars on site and sat outside !,Date of stay: May 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Sheffield, England, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/299jonathanp

The first thing to note was the extraordinary level of service. From Assistant Manager Sophia to the lovely gentlemen helping at the pool nothing was overlooked or unanticipated. Everyone working in the resort from the gardeners to the housekeepers to the wait staff the front desk the pool men - were all friendly courteous and kind. Calls for more towels or something forgotten on the breakfast tray were responded to immediately.  We stayed in a Pavilion Room near the adult pool which was incredibly spacious with a marvelous bathroom with double sink and separate large tub and shower.  Restaurants are excellent especially the Italian restaurant Arancino and don't miss breakfast at Solano with its expansive buffet. Also GREAT pizza at the poolside restaurant Azzera Grill.

So when the opportunity came we snapped it up. We were looking for a short relaxing holiday. This hotel was amazing from the moment we booked it. I received a phone call the day before we left London to confirm all was still ok and who was coming. As soon as au said its a mother daughter holiday they gave us a beautiful situated room with two separate beds. I couldn't recommend this hotel enough. We will be busting every year. The only down fall is that the food if you haven't got a bed&breakfast package the food generally at this hotel is expensive.    I could not thank the hotel staff enough. They were amazing. The pool guy was very on the ball.    The concierge team are to die for. Very helpful and knew exactly what to recommend.    If you stay here worth having the hammam it's an experience.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Suki H wrote a review May 2015,50,Perfect in everyway - Service beyond expectation,We stayed at The Four Season Resort Marrakech for our family holiday 3-10th May 2015 and WOW what a wonderful week!  Where do I start? The Range Rover Sport that was sent to collect us from the airport fully equipped with carseat and cold bottled water!  The Check in took place in our room after we were taken there by a golf buggy car!  We had booked the Deluxe Suite and asked for a cot for our toddler and a gate to be put up around the private plunge pool - all was done when we arrived along with a changing mat nappies wipes baby shampoo/lotion etc  The bed and pillows were so comfortable it was if sleeping in the clouds the room was spacious with an amazing walk in shower wet room big bathtub separate loo and double sink vanity area! Outside the bathroom there were double wardrobes and appropriate luggage storage. We had our own outdoor area with sun loungers etc.    Whilst the suite was amazing what made this holiday perfect for us was the hotel staff. I have never experienced such excellent customer service. Every member of staff we came across would say hello and interact with our toddler they would give him balloons play peek-a-boo and by the end of the trip he would look out for his favourite people! In particular Mohammed at the Azurra Restaurant was so brilliant in every way - so special thanks to him!  Someone else has mentioned the French Food & Beverage Director I was also impressed at his interaction with all guests at breakfast lunch and dinner - very friendly and interested in guest feedback.  We had an incident where my toddler's pjs were probably taken away with the bedsheets/towels by housekeeping. We asked if they had been found and the hotel looked into it extensively and kept us updated (not that we were precious about the pjs) - They were not found but the next day a Moroccan pj suite was left in our room with a handwritten note from housekeeping apologising the inconvenience. It certainly was not necessary but we were touched by the gesture and service which went over and above that of so many other hotels we have stayed in.    All the restaurants served great food again excellent service very attentive - if the slightest thing was not right like a frozen margarita instead of a classic the manager would personally come over and fix it - again not necessary but astounding service. At breakfast every morning when we arrived there would be a table ready for us with a high chair and plastic tableware for our son the waiter would know our coffee order after only 1 breakfast - a little touch which just makes such a difference.    There are 3/4 swimming pools Adult Family +baby Kids Club Pool - we only used the Family and Kids Club Pool but didn't need anything else there were water toys there a lifeguard the staff would intermittently arrive with glasses of iced water and various juices (carrot and orange mango etc) to keep us refreshed - so very attentive they know what you want before you know it!    We did utilise the hotel's babysitting service booked through the hotel concierge - we had a very sweet lady called Saira who watched our son while we had dinner - we would recommend this service to any parents.    There is a kids club for 4+ which I was able to take my son to play in their specific pool and soft play area as long as I stayed with him as he is only 20 months old - he enjoyed it as did I! Again wonderful staff!    I could write an essay on how beautiful our trip was in everyway we were all so relaxed and happy and would definitely come here again and indeed to any Four Seasons Resort.

This one is the best.    Four Seasons rooms are always so well thought-through bags of space super beds and beautiful bathrooms - plus a walk-in wardrobe. We asked for a quiet room and got one over looking the adult pool but sufficiently far back to be peaceful.    Overall the hotel is stunning and this one in particular was special for the beautiful lobby with the most amazing rose displays and décor with pops of stunning colour (often Four Seasons can be a bit neutral).    We received a warm welcome and spent a fab week here. Loved the adult pool and the fact kids/families area was separate!! very important for romantic couples.    All the restaurants were excellent as were the management and staff in each - probably our favourite was the Italian.    But what made the hotel was the staff firstly the French F &B Director who was always present checking things were running smoothly (I already wrote to him at the time) but in particular I would want to thank Sami and Zak at the adult pool both excellent but Zak was excellent I never saw a guy work and run so fast. He was onto every detail nothing was too much trouble and he should go far! Thanks to the both of you.

The hotel staff were wonderful and treated our 5 year old daughter like royalty. Mohammed at the Azzera Grill was amazing and our daughter looked for him every day because he was so friendly and fun. The Kids Club was out of this world. The tennis club was super and the quality of the lessons were top notch. The spa was lovely (especially the Hammam ritual - not to be missed).

The rooms are huge with walking closets  mini Haman and beautiful balcony.  The food is excellent the facilities are beautiful the pool and service are wonderful- the yoga on the roof with astonishing views was a bonus.  There are kids clubs and separate kids pool and adult pool area.    The resort has many small and large buildings on the ground. One is an Italian restaurant another is the SPA then the GYM Moroccan restaurant etc. you can walk between them and smell hundreds of well maintained herbs and flowers or you can ask for a gold carts.  You can order food by the pool the stuff is so well trained that they don’t ask unnecessary questions and seems can read your mind and do exactly what you want.  Housekeeping is excellent. Although wee were further in the gardens but it was not taking long time to get us room service or anything else.  You would not really want to leave the hotel as there are many things to do there wine testing cooking class gym classes even drawing class and Arabic language class        The service is what makes Four Season Four season- very happy and thankful for your outstanding service.

The rooms were beautiful and spacious the two pools were stunning. The breakfast buffet was delicious with a wide selection and we ate at the Italian restaurant one night and really enjoyed it as well. The spa was beautiful we both received excellent treatments and the fitness facilities were well equipped.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,kdbwright wrote a review Apr 2015,50,Amazing!,My family and another family came to Morocco for the first time during our children's school break. We are all discerning travelers that have stayed in the best boutique and corporate hotels/resorts around the world. This property by far is now one of our favorites. Why? The staff is incredibly attentive to detail and service. From the reservations manager who worked miracles for us (Ms. Amina) to the concierge staff (Ms. Soraya Mezian and the Cocierge Supervisor Ms. Jinan Ait Ali Oumensour) to the housekeeping staff and room service staff...I could go on. The facilities allowed both adults and children alike (ages 9 and 11) to equally have a wonderful time together and independently all the while knowing our children were safe. The grounds are gorgeous with Moroccan touches and a modern feel. The fresh flowers alone throughout the resort were simply stunning (and I am not a fan of roses). We planned 4 nights here and then went to a traditional riad. Although we really wanted the experience The Four Seasons was so amazing that we checked out and went back to the hotel for our last 2 nights. When we came back we felt like we were home when the staff came out to welcome us back! I cannot say enough. We fell in love with Marrakech and this Four Seasons. We will be back.,Date of stay: April 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,chicago,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kdbwright

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Harden809070 wrote a review Mar 2015,40,Far From The Madding Crowd,I really enjoyed my stay at this hotel as it provided exactly what I was looking for. Good service nice rooms and an oasis of calm from where I could dip in and out of the medina. This is a large resort hotel with nice gardens and a lovely heated pool with great service from the pool attendants. The buildings themselves wouldn't win any awards for great architecture but its all very functional and never feels busy. I had a suite on the 1st floor with a very large terrace and all the normal mod cons. The service was all very good as you would expect and the hotel provided a great base from which to explore its about a 10 min taxi into town. I tried all the restaurants in the hotel and they were all satisfactory although the expensive Italian wasn't as good as it should have been food or service wise ( I visited twice). The pool side restaurant was probably the pick of the bunch for a simple lunchtime bite. That said breakfast is great with a huge choice and sets you up well for the day. The standard of restaurants in the town are high and the choice is huge and the values even for the top end are good. Marrakech is a really good place to have fun testing out lots of good quality interesting restaurants. The one thing the hotel does miss is a proper bar for people to meet there is one but its small and apologetically tucked away a proper bar gives a hotel soul and this one could be missing a bit of that. In summary of course it's expensive but if you want a discreet get away from it all bit of luxury in Marrakech I'd start here.,Date of stay: January 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Paris, France",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Harden809070

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,beachwalkeralways wrote a review Mar 2015,50,Four Seasons service impressive.,Four Seasons resorts are known for their high level of service and this Marrakech resort is no exception. I was very impressed with the private car and driver that met me at the Marrakech Airport and even more delighted with a concierge that accompanied the driver. He provided wonderful commentary on the short drive to the resort and upon arrival took me to a delightful patio area where I was offered drinks while being checked into my room. From there I was taken to a beautifully appointed court yard room and given a description of the features of it. Beautiful roses traditional Moroccan tea and snacks were waiting for me in the sitting area of the very large room. Thoughtful items available in the room included an iron and ironing board along with a safe plush robes and slippers and a soaking tub. Staff was very attentive throughout the resort especially the concierge staff. Room service was excellent and the breakfast buffet was a combination of Moroccan European and American cuisine. One of the most impressive things about the resort were the immense displays of stunning roses in all public areas. Most stunning use of flowers I've ever seen.,Date of stay: February 2015,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Santa Monica, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/beachwalkeralways
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,amintn wrote a review Mar 2015,50,Very high quality of service/luxury,"This resort has almost anything you could ask for. While there is not necessarily a lot to do without leaving the grounds this was the point of our visit. The service was impeccable. Not only professionally but there was a real personal touch with many. We were ridden with flu during our stay and on more than one occasion we were brought lemon tea with ginger and honey without even asking for it. There is a tranquility pool (i.e. no kids allowed!) and an outdoor resto just next to it. The Spa is top even down to my masseuse handpicking herbs from the garden and making me herbal tea.    While there was little or nothing to complain about (the worst perhaps being an over-attentive waiter) there were a few things I thought could be improved upon. The food was ""good"" but not gourmandise quality the exception being the local buffet and Moroccan bbq (don't let the buffet scare you it was only for the local delicacies of which there must have been nearly 100 to choose from). This was outstanding. Maybe the one other thing I found lacking was the shampoo situation. While there was L'Occitane soap in the bathroom the shower had clay bottle of another product which was too thick would not easily wash out and smelled like it had seen better days. A little consistency with the L'Occitane would have been a nice touch. Still not a big deal I usually bring my own anyway (usually...)    The room was spacious and very comfortable with cozy terraces. Noise level was minimal with the exception of the rooftop lounge our first night equipped with a dj who seemed to think he was dj-ing a club. The music was so loud one evening we could not hear ourselves talk. When we got back to the room I could still hear the whump of his bass in my room. But this was only one night. Other than this there was virtually no noise heard while relaxing in the room.    We sat on occasion in the lounge in the main building and were brought mint tea often never lacking a full glass as much as we wanted. Much of the staff remembered our names even without asking for the room number.    As for the getting into the Medina a shuttle is offered from 18h to 22h free of charge but getting back is on you. It's only 10 minutes by car and if you wish to go during the day you'll need to arrange a taxi (50 to 80 MAD).",Date of stay: March 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Bangkok, Thailand",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amintn

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,jackwcres wrote a review Mar 2015,50,Exceptional experience,"My wife and i visited for two nights for my birthday. We stayed in a 3rd floor deluxe suite overlooking the adults pool.    The ride from the airport took ten minutes. We took a regular taxi from outside the terminal. It cost 150 MAD. I didn't haggle with the guy.    The welcome & check-in is exceptional. First impressions of the resort were of a chic property with great confidence and personality. There was a small bird flying around in the reception area. Perfectly in keeping with the Moroccan charm of the part open plan reception.    The room was stunning more like an opulently appointed apartment with two bathrooms a dressing room and a huge terrace with dining table and loungers. I have rarely encountered a better standard of amenities and quality of room furnishing. It looked and felt brand new. The only let down was the air conditioner in the bedroom which made a noise but provided no air of any kind let alone conditioning. I expect that was an exception that has now been fixed.    The grounds of this resort are slightly mesmerising. The pools area are the best of any boutique hotel in the world and the calm nature of the adults only pool was incredibly relaxing. The pool is simply huge. And empty. The lounge service around the pool was really good very friendly and every couple of hours we were offered complimentary cold fruit drink or a stick of pineapple. They have an excellent pool service manager.    The (very) seperate kids pool and facilities looked frankly amongst the best I have EVER seen and we will be coming back here with our kids.    At night the resort lights up with fire cauldrons and candles everywhere. It is incredibly evocative and romantic.    As we visited in February the restaurant and roof-top bar was rather quiet but we spent our time on the balcony or visited the Medina which is five minutes away.    The gym room is superbly equipped with the latest Techogym products and is probably the best small hotel gym I have ever worked out in.    The restaurant breakfast buffet is pretty good but the service was a little sloppy on the first morning we visited. I think they were lacking a restaurant manager that morning. Still the food was great.    Although I had not announced my birthday to the hotel we arrived back to our room to find a bottle of bubbly and a really nice birthday cake. This was totally unexpected and a real delight. The guy checking us in (whose name I have sadly forgotten :-( noticed my birthday from the passport date. What a credit to hotel you are!    I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel with a 9/10 rating for both couples and families.

Food choices for children were limited to a small menu that is used across the hotel restaurants and consists of the standard you see in most hotels i.e. nuggets fish fingers burgers pizza and pasta. Buffet restaurant was nice but hugely overpriced and little variety. This could have been the time of year we visited however. Pools were fabulous great kids club and kids swimming pool the staff in the kids club went out of their way to be welcoming and our son enjoyed a great evening at an organised party. Service around the pool area was sporadic but again could have been the time of year. While we were there the jacuzzi pool was working intermittently but was lovely when it was working.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,WuLuKeZou wrote a review Mar 2015,50,A splendid way to enjoy Marrakech: In Two Words: FIRST CLASS,"My family and I (wife nine-year-old son) had never been to Morocco before and were very excited to visit the city of Marrakech. We compared several hotels resorts and riads before deciding to stay at the Four Seasons Resort.    It turned out to be just the right choice.    The staff from the people who greeted us upon arriving (they learnt ahead of time the names of my wife and son and greeted each of us which surprised and thrilled my son who felt very important indeed) the ladies and gentlemen serving us at breakfast the staff in the halls the concierge up to the property manager himself were really first-class professionals. Friendly helpful approachable. The interactions with the staff were no doubt worthy of five-star service.    The property if not a true and ""authentic"" riad is beautful. Multiple restaurants bars and terraces allow for views to remember. The room we chose was comfortable as one would expect from Four Seasons and the bath was luxurious.    My wife partook of the ""hammam"" and massage experience; it was one of the highlights for her. Highly recommended.    Because we had never been to Marrakech before we used the concierge to book a couple of day trips for us. The first was a full-day tour of the medina including the souks (markets) the grounds of the Koutoubia mosque the Madrassa Ben Youssef and the Bahia Palace. Other friends had warned us about the aggressive selling techniques in the markets but with our personal guide (Aziz) not a single person hassled us in any way. Aziz navigated the warren of passageways (we would surely have gotten lost) and had stories and comments at every turn. He was obviously very proud of his country and culture as he pointed out tiny details about each place. Aziz was very friendly and helpful and patient to take dozens of pictures without even having to be asked. The 550 MAD (about 55 euros) was an unbelievable value. ASK FOR AZIZ if you book!    The second trip we booked was to the Atlas mountains to visit a berber village hike to the waterfall and see the sights. The hotel booked a driver who was not nearly as experienced as Aziz which was a disappointment. We were hoping for the same level of service as provided by Aziz which was perhaps too much to ask. My wife complained to the concierge who was incredibly kind and helpful. The Four Seasons refunded half of the fee for the booking and arranged a free transfer to the airport for our departure as a gesture. This was in my opinion MORE than fair and in fact quite a generous offer. When we checked out the manager himself came personally to apologise for something that frankly was not the fault of the hotel.    As I saw it this was testimony to what excellent customer-oriented service is defined by. Like everything else in our stay it was absolutely first-class.    For the actual visit to the mountain we hired a guide for 300 MAD (about 30 euros) who led us for two hours to a couple of waterfalls. Again more than worth the price as he pointed out the various aspects of the mountains the customs of the locals and what to look out for. At a couple of the more slippery spots he helped carry our son across and up/down. Very friendly very helpful.    The trip to the Atlas mountains is something I would also highly recommend; just bring good comfortable shoes. It was the highlight of the trip for our son.    Finally the concierge recommended a couple of restaurants and they did not disappoint. Once again first-class service.    In summary we were nothng short of impressed by the Four Seasons. We expected luxury and they delivered. Plus.    We would go back in a second and recommend without hesitiation",Date of stay: February 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Paris, France",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WuLuKeZou

Unfortunately the service here we found was very hit and miss. An example of this was on our first night we asked the hotel to reserve us a table at La Salama restaurant in the Medina. The concierge was fantastic! She made the reservation and took the liberty of arranging the restaurant’s courtesy car to pick us up and take us to the restaurant as she was afraid we might get lost finding it in the Medina! I thought this service was first class and to be honest it’s one of the reasons you stay in a Four Season’s resort!    The service around the pool however was very erratic. The first and second day it was very hard to even get service and if you asked for water it seemed that they only wanted to sell you a whole bottle rather than get you a glass of chilled water which is usually complimentary in any other 5 star resorts I have stayed in! On the last day it was completely different frozen snacks were continually served as well as chilled water offered – we thought it was really strange that service in a place like this would change completely from one day to the next! I also had a situation where we had checked out of the hotel on the last day and were sitting in the lobby area waiting for our car to take us to the airport and I asked for a glass of water because it was quite a warm day – I couldn’t believe that even then they didn’t want to just get me a glass of chilled water the attendant almost insisted I purchase a bottle of water! To be honest I felt a bit annoyed by this as from my point of view if you are staying in a 5 star hotel and paying 5 star rates you should be able to ask for a glass of water if you are thirsty and not be made to feel as though you need to buy a bottle. This in my opinion is “nickel and diming” which Four Seasons say they are against doing to their guests.,Date of stay: September 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trent1979
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,David S wrote a review Feb 2015,50,Best Hotel I've stayed in,I travel a lot for work and I'm spoiled and jaded. I never write reviews with one or two exceptions. So this is by definition exceptional.    We were offered hot towels and mint tea as we arrived bags taken care of. Throughout our stay we were addressed by name - and given it's a big hotel and was quite full I found that extraordinary.    The room was incredible for a family of four and I bet the villas are even more spectacular. It places family right at the heart of the what the hotel does unlike so many places where kids are to be neither seen nor heard. And yet if you want to avoid that you can enjoy all the usual 5* facilities also at the hotel's centre.    The hotel has 4 restaurants each with its own personality and cuisine but all great. It's not cheap but this is Marrakech and there are tons of places to choose from on your doorstep. Tip: order a big breakfast for one in your room and it's enough for four.    The staff are incredible. Attentive is expected but this is another level. One of our sons had a couple of nosebleeds; each time in a public area. No problem no fuss and only great care and a genuine concern that all was well.    I could go on for ages but best I stop. We're coming up with a plan to return because once you've experienced it you'll want another one to look forward to. Everyone else we met there were returning guests.    This place is a one-off and its staff a credit to the business.,Date of stay: February 2015,,"Stansted Mountfitchet, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/857DavidS857
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,JetBackPack wrote a review Feb 2015,50,Architecturally Awesome,We've had the privilege of staying at many Four Seasons properties across the globe and I still maintain that the properties outside of the US are the best. The FS Marrakech is architecturally breathtaking. A great mix of rooms villas and all combining local architecture design and materials. We had a Grand Pavilion Suite that came with it's heated plunge pool and had a garden area that also had a fireplace and an external dining area.The resort is also quite compact and walking from restaurant to the gym to the room isn't a workout in of itself. The adult pool is very quiet and relaxing. BTW the gym is great with a range of machines and weight machines too. The staff bring a special warmth to the your stay and they all try to go the extra mile to make your stay memorable. The Concierge service is quite well staffed and can help plan your day or week at a pace you like. The restaurants on site are excellent -- the Italian restaurant was a good choice and of course the Moroccan restaurant was an interesting experience with live music belly dancers and a henna station. Jamal Al Fnaa which is the square from where the souks radiate is a 10 min drive at best or a 30 minute walk. It's 15 minutes to the airport. All in all very accessible and my first choice in Marrakech.,Date of stay: February 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JetBackPack
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Halo wrote a review Feb 2015,50,We had an excellent long weekend (4-nights for the price of 3) stay. The resort was an oasis of calm and relaxation.,We (my wife and I) had a wonderful relaxing stay. It is a very romantic resort. A short taxi ride (50 dirhams the normal fare) to anywhere in the Medina. Yes you could stay in a Riad and walk but it is a wonderful experience to stay at the Four Seasons. In the same luxury category as the Royal Mansour and La Mamounia (both of which we visited during our stay) the Four Seasons is more relaxed and far less expensive than either of the others. We would recommend dining in restaurants in the Medina and staying at the Four Seasons. Moroccan white wine is wonderful by the way - do be sure to try it.,Date of stay: February 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Halo

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Dianne K wrote a review Feb 2015,50,Wonderful hotel,Our son will be leaving school this year and we were aware that this might be our last holiday with him. Well what a way to go! The hotel is absolutely fantastic facilities are amazing and the food is universally great. Our half term seemed to be a week early this year so there were very few other teenagers but at normal holiday times the resort has the best facilities for teenagers that we have ever seen: banks of computers pool table table football basket ball hoop - lots of games and…..a cinema! However as it happens our son didn't miss young company at all because there is simply so much to see and do in Marrakech. We went out most days and could not have asked for a better hotel to return to.The service was simply outstanding nothing was ever any trouble and every member of staff genuinely seemed to care about us having a wonderful time. With their kindness they helped make this an exceptionally happy family holiday and one that we will always remember.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,ErinR1988 wrote a review Feb 2015,50,Amazing trip!,I stayed here with my fiancee for five nights at the start of February and it was a dream trip. From the moment we walked through the door we were treated like royalty. The staff were incredible and couldn't do enough for us but not in an overbearing way.    We got an upgrade and our room was lovely and spacious. There was a real Moroccan feel everywhere and it smelt like incense! Pool area was lovely and spacious but we couldn't make much use of it as it was quite chilly the week we were there. The spa was good as were the gym facilities.    The restaurants were good but one thing we would say is that the meals were very expensive but probably to be expected in a Four Seasons. We ate out in Marrakech 3 of the 5 nights and the staff can organise bookings and also a courtesy car if available. We were provided with a list of restaurants and all 3 we picked were good.    Overall a really lovely peaceful luxurious stay and even though we have now done most of the sites in Marrakech we would love to  return simply to enjoy the hotel especially in the better weather.    If you want to stay in the middle of the hustle and bustle of Marrakech stay in a riad in the Medina but if you want a more relaxing time stay here!,Date of stay: February 2015,,"Dublin, Ireland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ErinR1988
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Likes to travel wrote a review Feb 2015,50,one of the nicest hotel/resorts in Marrakech,Everything was outstanding during our recent stay. The building and grounds are of the highest quality and well maintained and attention is given to every detail in the rooms and throughout the property. All the staff were very friendly and extremely helpful. The location is near the Medina and the main square but not actually within walking distance. The grounds and pools are outstanding but we were there in February and could not enjoy it all. The buffet breakfast was also great with additional specials every day.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Mavis wrote a review Feb 2015,50,Amazing attention to detail,Stayed in the Four Seasons for my sisters 21st birthday and I've never experienced anything like it - the staff were unbelievable attentive and knew what they were doing. They noticed from my sisters passport that she would be turning 21 during our stay so when we were at the pool they bought up a complimentary bottle of champagne and a cake iced with her name. We couldn't believe how wonderful and thoughtful the staff were. The hotel itself was beautiful - always pristine and beautifully lit up with candles at night time. Our room was always tidied and it was so peaceful and quiet - we never heard anything. The pool was to die for and pool staff were always on hand to move the heavy umbrellas when the sun changed! Meals are a bit pricey - we ended up paying nearly £80 for breakfast for 3 so I'd definitely recommend travelling into Marrakech to experience the local (and much much cheaper) cuisine. The hotel offer a free car to take you into the centre in the evenings and we had wonderful conversations with the friendly young driver. In the morning and afternoons the staff will phone a taxi for you and give you bottles of water whilst you wait. The taxis only cost about 50 dirhams max - don't pay anymore as they will drive you for this cheap (equivalent to around £5) so the Four Seasons is a perfect hotel on the outskirts of the centre. Honestly this is the best hotel I've ever stayed in it felt like I was in another world and I never wanted to leave - I will most definitely be staying in more Four Seasons wherever I go. Recommend highly.,Date of stay: August 2014,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mavisdelellis

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Lorne B wrote a review Jan 2015,50,Words cannot do justice,This was our second stay in consecutive years at a four seasons property. We stayed at the Four Seasons in Nevis in May 2012 and stayed here May 2013. Last year was the nicest resort I have ever seen but this is certainly 1A. This resort I felt was a lot larger and you could literally spend the day walking around and still not see everything. The pool in the middle of the resort is about the nicest I have ever seen. I woke up one morning early and wanted to go to the gym but it was closed. I contacted the front desk and on my way over to the gym someone picked my up in a golf cart drove me to the gym and provided me with a bottle of water a hot towel and a box of fresh dates. That is the one thing that I miss the most the inordinate amount of fresh dates available at different areas throughout the property. They taste like liquid honey of deliciousness. The foods delicious and the staff was very friendly and accommodating. The rooms were ridiculous and each room had its own private balcony (even those on the first floor). I loved this resort.

We were greeted by the concierge who offered tea and snacks while we checked in from the couch. He then escorted us to the room giving us a tour of the property on the way. The room was beautiful. Comfortable beds large space beautiful bathroom. Everything a 5 star hotel should be and more. The hotel restaurants (3 total) were exceptional as well. I highly recommend the Moroccan restaurant for breakfast and dinner.    The staff went above and beyond to make absolutely sure our stay was perfect. They did everything from helping with reservations outside the hotel planning day trips into the mountains by private driver and even helped me locate an item of luggage that was lost by the airline.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Laura_PBlondie wrote a review Jan 2015,50,Wow - concierge were spectacular!!,Four Seasons is mind blowing full stop. After our first Four Seasons experience in the Seychelles we thought the second would be a tough act to follow. We were wrong. The hotel was lovely and clean had everything you could ever want and was a short (but good distance) from the madness of the Medina. But my goodness the concierge where do they find these people?? They are amazing!! This is why the Four Seasons are the best.    HOT WATER BOTTLE: other than being generally excellent kind and helpful and always knowing your name the concierge pulled out all the stops to help with my back pain. Calling the concierge and asking if they had a hot water bottle late on a Sunday evening there was some delay and some complimentary 'feel better soon' tea delivered to the room. Some time after this a hot water bottle arrived the concierge had especially sent someone out to buy one somewhere across Marrakech late on a Sunday night it arrived... free of charge. I love these people!!    ART: We also fell in love with some art on the walls here after asking the team at the Four Seasons Jinan on reception personally researched and then Whats app'd the artist on her phone for us. She delivered information on the artist printed to our room and arranged for us to have a personal viewing of the artists work on a Sunday.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,mrfishynyc wrote a review Jan 2015,30,Many better choices,If you've never traveled outside the country and are looking for a taste of your local Hyatt then this place is for you. This hotel has the Pottery Barn look that could be anywhere. We had a first floor room stuck between the restaurant and the kids play room and given that it was the holiday our hallway was a children's highway. We asked for a different room and they couldn't accommodate us. Our only choice was to pay $250 more a night for a suite on a higher floor. The room was nice but given the price it was missing the niceties that one expects from a Four Seasons Suite. The only bright spot was the buffet breakfast. So good it's almost worth the $35/per person.,Date of stay: December 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,nyc,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrfishynyc

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Houda O wrote a review Jan 2015,50,Fun haven though Secluded,"I stayed 2 days in this resort for business. The rooms are very comfortable with a neutral beige and white palette. The bedding is very comfortable and many details refer to Moroccan craftsmanship. I could tell for example going in the adult club that the tables are massive wood and the lanterns are not a cheap brass.  The resort is very large and there are plenty of activities to do so you do not get bored and it caters to different styles from yoga lovers to joggers or SPA enthusiasts.  Yet it's not a big crowded compound the way the pavilions are set is in such a way that you always have the option of having some ""me"" time when you want more serenity and privacy.  I loved the liveliness of the place for example there are cages with exotic birds chirping all day fresh cut flowers in a glass composition at the entryway.  The one touch I mostly appreciated was that you can have tea and nuts at pretty much any moment of the day.  The food is delicately prepared and the menus cater to all tastes from italian to french to authentic moroccan gastronomy (and special-diet food also).  This is a great place to visit all year but it's most charming in spring when it is not too hot.  Also the place has a new charm at night when candles are lit everywhere and the light escapes the handmade lanterns.  Highly recommend this place.",Date of stay: January 2015,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Casablanca, Morocco",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/h0uda0
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Jacqueline796 wrote a review Jan 2015,40,Lovely hotel,Myself and my 2 adult children enjoyed Christmas at the Four Seasons Hotel in Marrakech. We were all seeking some peace and quiet and of course a little luxury after a hectic few months with London life. I would like to comment individually on the different areas of the hotel.    Reception and welcome    The staff are quite delightful and very welcoming and check in is very quick and easy. It's always nice to be offered a welcome drink after a tiring journey.    Gingerbread house    A gingerbread house was constructed at the reception area for Christmas I thought it was a wonderful idea containing different varieties of sweets chocolates and biscuits. It was absolutely divine and I visited each day. The small children and large (including my own) were mesmerised by it quite frankly I couldn't pass by without going inside for a little treat.    Room/accommodation    We had a standard room however it was spacious enough for the 3 of us. I liked the separate closet area and the spacious balcony. The bath was hugely deep although I didn't have the opportunity to try it. Having said this I would like to try a different room next time. The housekeeping team did a wonderful job each day and I hope that they received the envelope I left for them upon departure.    Breakfast    Only my son made it down for a full breakfast and reported that it was superb lots of choice and all delicious.    My daughter and myself are light eaters at breakfast and just ordered room service instead. The portions were very disappointing though I would actually make an effort to go down to the wondrous buffet as described by my son next time. However this was a minor thing for us as lunch and dinner are more of a focus for us.    The Grounds    The grounds are immaculately tendered and it's a real pleasure walking around the resort. Very small touches such as if you are walking along and a buggy is coming your way they will stop and wait for you to pass. This is a small thing but all these small touches make a real difference and are noted by travellers like myself.    Adult pool    As a regular swimmer at home it is pretty essential that wherever I travel for a relaxing holiday has a pool large enough so that I can swim freely. This was absolutely superb. I swam for 30-40 minutes each day undisturbed by anyone as the pool is so huge. I absolutely loved the beautiful colours of the pool. At this time of the year you need to time your swims when the sun appears as it can get a little cold however this did not deter me one bit. The separate pools for adults and children are a brilliant feature.    The lovely gentleman who tended the beds and towels did a fabulous job and was very efficient with provision of the towels. It was a nice touch to have sun tan lotion and hats if needed.    Pool bar restaurant    We dined here on a number of occasions. The meat and fish was very tasty and I thought that the cuisine was of a good standard. The staff are very attentive and respectful. It was a little chilly at times for me though and I would prefer to visit when it's slightly warmer next time.    The gym    All 3 of us really appreciated this facility. The machinery is brand spanking new and there is an excellent variety. I do think it's a good idea to have the cardio and weights rooms separate and never would have thought of this myself but I liked it very much. The staff are courteous and not intrusive but are on hand to assist if necessary. We didn't use the shower facilities there but all looked in good order. I think that the addition of some power drinks or juices of some kind would be welcome particularly to replenish a little after a hard work out although the nuts and dried fruits were welcome. It can be a good hour or so before you eat if you are going to make use of the steam and jacuzzi in the spa following a work out therefore one could really benefit from an extra little boost just to keep you going. You have these juices in many of your other Four Seasons properties. Perhaps something to consider going forward. All in all an excellent facility.    Spa facility    Myself and my daughter used this daily apart from our last day at the resort. The jacuzzi and steam room are delightful and it's nice to have the usual loungers to relax on following a good workout steam jacuzzi then shower. I wished that there had been a better choice of tea as it was the same each day. The hairdryers in the changing room are very weak I would take my own next time. The spa facility is more than adequate although I did have an issue with male therapists and cleaners entering at times. This is something I raised with management but I have still not had this addressed. I was offered a meeting that evening but had to decline as we had a dinner reservation then no-one followed up which was disappointing. It has sort of slipped through the loop.    Morroccan buffet    We feasted on the Morroccan buffet twice. It was absolutely divine and the best cous cous we have ever tasted. I don't often have 3 courses but I certainly made every effort on these occasions to try as much as I could. The different salads were so fresh and tasty the tagines were delicious. I would say that this is the best value restaurant if cost is a consideration. Wine is rather expensive though and thankfully I am not a big drinker. The restaurant staff could not have been more helpful they are sublimely supreme when it comes to providing service and we even had live music on our last evening.    Christmas drinks by invitation of Felix Murillo    We were very kindly invited to the Christmas market for Christmas drinks one evening by the General Manager Felix Murillo. Incidentally I do not believe he was there but his staff made up for his absence as they all go out of their way to provide amazing service. It was a lovely atmosphere they had set up various little games on different stalls. I quite enjoyed taking part although was a little surprised at my (adult) children's reluctance. I guess when you pass the age of forty you are more game to have a go at anything. Anyway it was a very pleasant hour spent drinking Champagne playing games and chatting to the ever sociable staff.    Bleu D'Orange (I think). The Italian one    Beautiful relaxing atmosphere with low lighting. Menu was very expensive we felt but even so this was a holiday and I don't mind splashing out when I am on holiday. We were looking forward to some delightful cuisine. We were rather disappointed sadly the portions were very small and the food was mediocre. A couple were placed next to us with a toddler and a baby at 7.30 pm in the evening. We thought that this was more of an adult type of exclusive restaurant with exclusive prices and did not expect to have this company at a table next to us at this time of the evening. We would not have minded at the Morroccan buffet but to have banging and crying in such a beautiful setting with low lighting just reminded me of bed time when my children were young and I certainly didn't come here for this type of ambience. We ate up as quickly as we could and left feeling ripped off and dissatisfied. Incidentally we were offered complementary drinks for good reason. Once again the staff were superb.    Lobby lounge    Not sure what is going on here. It's very hit and miss. Once you get someone's attention you are fine but in between the staff can get a little lost. I.e. You can't find them. I dined here on my last day whilst my children went for a last minute visit to the souk. I had a bad experience which was resolved by the manager and I am sure lessons will be learned going forward.    I believe it's essential to give honest feedback otherwise how can an establishment improve and move forward. In summation the Four Seasons Marrakech is a wonderful resort and I will most definitely return. The brief for my visit was to enjoy a well earned break with my family in order for us all to slow down a little and spend some quality together over Christmas. The hotel delivered we all left feeling totally relaxed and rejuvenated with smiles on our faces and with some lasting memories of our visit. I was under budget for my stay so all in all is was good value for us as a family. The staff make this place alongside with superb facilities. There may be some small areas for improvement but overall you will not be disappointed in my opinion if you plan a visit here.

Room quality is at the Four Seasons standard level- without any complain! Sleeping was great! We could not enjoy the pool as it was cold.  Breakfast food was great when I could find the reastaurant. All together is a bit difficult to find places in the hotel. The map they provide you at the reception is not clear enough. I was always lost searching for restaurant for meeting rooms for my room....  One evening we had Italian food - really top quality.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Soiam50+ wrote a review Dec 2014,20,Not your typical Four Seasons experience-Easter 2014,"After I initially posted on travel advisor last April I pulled the negative comments as the manager called me and arranged to shorten my visit by one day. In addition was offered 2 free nights in 2015 (not likely to use ). He apologized for my poor experience and attributed to the Holiday rush. After the apologyI pulled my initial comments before I left Morocco.    On vacation in Tokyo now 8 months later. As I was discussing Marrakech with a friend when I told him avoid the 4 seasons absolutely … not four seasons quality service and noisy rooms. So reposting    Bottom line: Simply bad information/coordination among different areas of hotel. Not prepared for holiday rush like 4 seasons in other locations .. absolutely the worst service I have ever had at a four seasons ( but let's be real bad for 4 seasons is still a high quality problem)    +Lacks proper concierge and front desk communication and follow up for a 5 star.  +Poor pool maintenance ( heating not functionally properly ...dirty water and soiled towels)  +Restaurants not available for booking but somehow empty when dining  + VIP airport arrival service confusing and rushed.. not worth it    4 seasons at following cities are where I have stayed  >>>>Prague  >>>Bombay  >>>Washington  >>>New York  >>London  >>>Hawaii  >>>Milan  >>Paris    Anything good... yes the following    >>> food quality and friendly restaurant staff    >>> rooms were clean and well appointed    The note I sent to my travel agent during the stay    Roger    Hotel is pretty but too much work. I definitely would tell friends and guests to avoid    >>>> Poor coordination with reception/concierge/bell desk    I had booked a tour guide for tuesday am at 10 for the city thru the concierge... I called at 9;45 asked the concierge where we should wait... she said lobby.  we waited in the lobby from 10 til 10:30 no guide.. so went to concierge again  she went outside and tracked down guide....    >>>> Trying to book dinner… restaurants full but tables empty    Yesterday we were told restauratnts were fully booked... so ate in 1/2 empty morrocan restaurant. We made reservation at Italian tonight at 7 again 1/2 empty when we left at 9:30    >>> then when I tried to prepone my departure cancelling with 1 night at tail end they never got back to Sam ( my travel agent )until I went personally to reception who then called him  I offered that I would vacate room in am on thursday…    Very very very poor english skills for a four seasons....    >>>pool… dirty and not heated .. family destination !    I called ahead since we were coming from london to check if the pool was heated. It was not heated when we got there…Pool heat was was not working properly on a Holiday week.  lots of kids shivering....!!! I went in the cold pool…ok but very cold... pool was also filthy ( spoons moss on bottom of pool and trash ) not four seasons pool pool    >>> vip arrival services arranged by airport not worth charge and not efficient VIP services .my fault for not checking number of pieces but horrible communication to resolve problems  + My hand baggage ( wheelie ) was left behind at Airport. I discovered this at hotel. VIP rep did not ask or check how many pieces. then rushed thru baggage claims and car with as dialogue Driver never asked how many pieces and the bags were transfer  1 checked bag was late so the vip rep hunted down the bag. I had placed my wheelie next to his trolley. He had taken Eiko's wheelie. Yes I should have also checked that he had gathered all the bags but assumed. He had everything under control.  Soon we met driver who also did not ask about how many pieces... I understand it is my responsibility but every driver or porter I have had asks how many bags and checks...    + when i discovered the bag was missing. I spoke to 3 different people asking them to call the driver and VIP services rep.. No one could get thru. The reception clerk who checked into room said he would follow up. The concierge called told me to go the airport at 7;30 with my passport and identify what is in bag. I asked specfically if they found my bag she said I do not know. I said ok I will go to airport at 7:30 what time should I leave. She said I will arrange for a club car to pick u up at 7:15 waited til 7:45 in front of my room then walked to concierge area I played client volleyball and ""i do not know anything"" with 3 people. then the clerk who had ustaken room suggested I go the airport. i asked where to go he said information booth...  I took a taxi there no one was at info booth. the taxi driver helped me get into baggage area.. there at the lost baggage area a smiling VIp rep. i thnked him. i asked him where he found it he said it was found near baggage carosuel.

Morning and early afternoon by the pool gave us the right inspiration to og into town as of mid afternoon when Marrakech Wakes up and shows its best side.  We will og back to this resort which in addition to being in fascinating Marrakech also is a wonderful destination in its own right.  Being experienced travelers having ad the pleasure of staying at many fine resorts we were still impressed by the extreme cleanliness comfort and friendliness of the staff at the Four Seasons in Marrakech.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,WorkingMomNYC2 wrote a review Nov 2014,50,A stay to remember,I just returned from the Four Seasons Marrakech where I stayed for 5 days while attending a business conference and wish I could have stayed much longer. If traveling to Marrakech or anywhere near Morocco I can’t recommend highly enough that you include this resort as part of your holiday or business travel if only to experience the perfect balance of luxury service and one element I didn’t expect the exceptional food at all of their restaurants especially the breakfast buffet – or room service.    The grounds welcome you to a very private location removed from the hectic but exciting energy of Marrakech. There are loads of other hotels less than a 10-minute drive on a “strip”. While for one second I questioned if I should have stayed in that area only because it was near my conference one evening upon arrival at the Four Seasons property and I knew I had made the right decision. Tranquil and beautiful grounds with all of the services of both a business hotel and a luxury resort. The most difficult part about staying here was motivate to leave the property for work as the spa lounges and grounds could easily keep you from your meetings.    Service was stellar. All of your needs were met and they were quick to respond with any request like an umbrella brought to your room and fast room service.    The Spa. Upon arrival I had the luxury of attending the spa for a couple of appointments I had booked in the weeks prior. Like a typical New Yorker planning a business trip I must have changed all of my appointments about 3 – 4 times as my schedule for meetings kept changing. However thru it all Houda who managed my appointments both by email and just as delightful on sight was so genuinely gracious and managed to work with my chaos. The spa is divine from layout to treatments offered. Again I wish I could have spent an entire day there instead of at meetings. Also at the spa I had a blow dry in advance of my panel the next day. Even in NY with my own stylist the blow dry is never quite right so I figured I could at least just keep the frizz at bay. Enter Samir with his tools needed very limited discussion and off he styled – like an artist. I haven’t been that happy with my hair in ages – and it was effortless on his part.    I do not know when I can come back again to Marrakech but there is no question this will be where I stay. Also having never stayed at a Four Seasons property I would jump at an opportunity to enjoy any other business or leisure stay at any of their properties based on my outstanding experience in Marrakech. It has been a long time since I actually felt sad on the last day of a business trip as I just didn’t want to leave the property. It’s hard to give up feeling like royalty.

We dined at the main Moroccan buffet the pool café and the Italian restaurant plus bar snacks and drinks in the lobby area. Everything was delicious and beautifully presented. Our room and bath were very large and luxurious. The spacious well-furnished balcony afforded us a beautiful view over the olive grove and pool. We could leave the sliders open so that in the morning we were awakened by birdsong. I appreciated the fact the hotel is a 5 minute drive from the Medina...giving a sense of peace and relaxation.

Lunchtime at the poolside restaurant evenings spent mainly outside at the Italian restaurant.    Spa service very good (they came to the room for everything I wanted). There wasnt much atmosphere which suited us perfecty. Lots of reading crosswords and jigsaws rather than socialising or dancing.    Extremely relaxing but I wouldn't recommend it if you want entertainment. I'm sure it was just the time of year we went but everywhere was very quiet. Perfect for me but wouldn't suit everyone.

Although my expectations were high prior to my arrival the hotel certainly exceeded these.    The service and personal touches were impeccable you really couldn’t fault their attention to detail and willingness to make your stay the most enjoyable and memorable. For example complimentary refreshments (welcome drink ice cream smoothies) brought to you whilst you relaxed by the pool courtesy transfer into Marrakech centre on your request and completing your departure card for you on your behalf.    The staff were most impressive. There was never a point during our stay that we were kept waiting for anything. In fact they were seldom seen but always there when needed. They were genuine friendly helpful and well trained but never intrusive.    We were allocated a deluxe room which was extremely spacious with a super kind bed large double sinked bathroom walk-in wardrobe and spacious balcony with chaise longue. You couldn’t fault the décor (traditional Moroccan furnishings and handcrafted local woodwork) comfort (home from home feel) or cleanliness (twice daily housekeeping).    Breakfast wasn’t lavish with huge arrays of buffets but more intermit priding themselves on quality over quantity. Service again was second to none and you were never without a drink.  We didn’t actually dine in at the hotel during the evening however I’m sure judging by lunch (poolside restaurant) that this would have been amazing.    The hotel has two pools one for families and the other for couples (the quite pool). There was no scrimping on design between the pools and was nice to be given choice of ""activity"" level.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Cameramadsolihull wrote a review Oct 2014,40,Tranquility in Marrakech,My husband and I spent 7 nights at The Four Seasons:    Pros - adult pool was vast and warm plenty of sunbeds pool guys excellent with towels/drinks etc room was adequate (no mirror other than in the bathroom for makeup though but handy walk in wardrobe/storage area) bed was huge and very comfortable indeed maid service twice a day changing towels bedding etc. The hotel staff are all very friendly and the manager is often seen chatting to guests checking on their views.    Cons - the restaurants/drinks areas lacked any atmosphere and are often very quiet particularly the Morrocan buffet however the food at the Italian one was good and the manager very efficient.    The Four Seasons is c10 mins from the airport and shouldn't be more than 100 MAD each way in a taxi. The Hotel is c7mins by taxi from the square in Marrakech (50 MAD each way) there is a hotel courtesy car for your outbound trip (on a first come first served basis after 6pm in the evening) which is a nice touch. We were advised walking was possible and that it was nice; not sure I entirely agree there is a footpath along a dual carriageway but it takes almost one hour to walk into Marrakech; save your feet get a taxi and walk around the souk would be my advice (unless you want to sit on a camel for a photograph!).    Yes you are 'pestered' in the square for various unusual offerings (snakes/monkeys/henna tattoos etc) however a firm but polite 'No thanks' does the trick. We ate at two Riads which were both excellent and better value. That said everything looks alittle uninviting from the outside however once through the door a whole new world of pure tranquility and luxury opens up around a courtyard (do your research beforehand). We also ate a L'italien in La Mamounia which was well worth the extra splurge the Mozzarella Souffle was spectacular!    Definitely the right decision to stay at The Four Seasons to ensure peace and quiet when not sampling the hectic delights of central Marrakech.,Date of stay: October 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Solihull,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cameramadsolihull

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,TerjeaJCB wrote a review Oct 2014,50,Long weekend in Marrakech,My partner and I found our stay in Marrakech both bustling and tranquil. Marrakech is a vibrant city with a bustling Medina good shopping in the new town and some excellent restaurants. Our tranquillity was in the form of the Four Season an Oasis just outside of the Medina with excellent facilities and spacious ground and pools. The Staff was incredibly helpful courteous and excellent at look after you. Rooms were exceptional good well designed spacious and confortable. The hotel also offers guests free evening transport to the Medina. Recommend staying at this Oasis if you want to stay in the bustling Medina.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,jandktravelers wrote a review Oct 2014,50,Can we add more stars for this hotel?,We spent 4 nights in this hotel and it was the best part of our visit to Marrakech. The city can be a little overwhelming and staying here was the perfect balance. It is true to the service you expect from most Four Seasons properties. Our initial room was by the restaurant courtyard. We are noise sensitive and the manager moved us immediately to another room no questions asked. The hotel property and gardens were beyond perfect. After 6 days of hard travel through other parts of Morocco we were ever so grateful to be relaxing in the care of exquisitely trained staff who were genuinely interested in our comfort health and experience. It was our 17th wedding anniversary trip and they had made a cake for our arrival in our room and provided a bottle of bubbles. Wifi is a little slow but it was slow all over Morocco. I only found one thing rather odd. They allow men attendants into the women's spa areas. Being a spa goer in the states and elsewhere I was shocked when a male was showing a woman around to the different pools etc. Good thing swim suits are required. I don't really understand why the spa isn't co-ed if men are allowed to walk around in the women's area. Just an oddity and maybe a custom I'm not familiar with. Sort of blew my relaxation/spa experience though. Other than that this hotel was really really top notch.,Date of stay: October 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Dallas, Texas",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jandktravelers

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Linda B wrote a review Oct 2014,50,Exotic Marrakech in a fabulous hotel,"Got back yesterday from a fabulous 4-day break in the opulent Four Seasons Hotel. I want to give this hotel more than the five stars rating. The gardens are beautifully kept and the flowers mainly roses in the hotel are freshly arranged I think every day. These alone deserve 6 stars.    Our room was very clean and spacious as well as the wet room/bathroom. Plenty of towels and toiletries and a ""state of the art"" loo! The bed was very comfortable and the balcony faced the lovely gardens.    I cannot tell you how gracious courteous and friendly the hotel staff are and I would especially like to say a big ""Thank You"" to the restaurant's maître'd Frederico (Arancino) the sunset bar's Yassine and the life guard/pool attendant Anas for the amazing way they looked after us and for the celebratory glasses of champagne and the ""anniversary"" cocktails.    We were celebrating our wedding anniversary and the hotel staff/management gave us a delicious cake which was beautifully decorated as well as gorgeous red roses in our room. Again a BIG Thank You - a wonderful surprise and a lovely gesture - much appreciated.    The people of Marrakech are unbelievably courteous and friendly and everywhere we went we were made extremely welcome. The Souk and the main square are a ""must"" as well as the beautiful Jardin Majorelle. There is an Yves St Laurent monument which is lovely and after a ""heady"" walk around the Souk it was very calming to wander around this fabulous garden.    One thing you must be aware of and that is the bikers moped riders and cars in the centre. You literally ""take your life in your own hands"" when trying to cross the streets! It's unbelievable!! I don't think driving tests are mandatory.    If you're looking for some winter sunshine exotic country full of wonderful friendly people and amazing hotels then look no further than Marrakech.

Upon entrance the whole area is covered in flowers and the scent of fresh flowers is beautiful. There were room welcoming Moroccan sweets and the kids were brought muffins and cookies. The baby cots are very high quality and very well padded for your babies comfort.    The swimming pools were perfect with a tented swimming pool for babies. The Bar at the top has sensational views.    The Italian restaurant has a truffle pizza that is a MUST. The barbecue by the swimming pool had such a huge variety of delicious choices. The only thing that I would say they could improve on is the choice of food in the breakfast buffet for a hotel of this price and this rating I have seen better.

You feel the marrakech culture in every corner of the hotel. Of course the price for all this is not cheap but it is worth every penny. Location is not the best since it is not close to downtown but at the same time being outside the hustle and bustle of marrakech downtown is somehow a delight because you can enjoy a peaceful place 10 minutes by car to the crazy marrakech downtown.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,traceymccarter wrote a review Oct 2014,50,"The best experience in Marrakech, incredible and caring staff.",We came to the Four Seasons as part of the recent conference my husband attended. We brought our 2 daughters with us to later tour Morocco as a family. Unfortunately our youngest who is also a type-1 diabetic got sick our first night and needed medical attention that required a doctor visit to our room an ambulance and a hospital stay for 24 hours. The staff at the Four Seasons Marrakech was beyond AMAZING from the assistance with doctors to the sweet notes and flowers left daily by housekeeping and the kids' club to room service to food services which even prepared food for us to take to our daughter in the hospital (via private car transfer). Staff somehow knew who we were and would stop to ask how our daughter was doing by name. While our time in Marrkech was not as fully enjoyed as we had planned the Four Seasons made it possible for us to find comfort and regain health to continue on with our trip. We were deeply touched by the level of care and kindness we received during our stay.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,David-RR wrote a review Oct 2014,50,A really lovely hotel,Just back from 5 nights at this lovely hotel. Went for a quiet break last time I visited Marrakech I stayed at the Sofitel Imperial Palace which is not a patch on the Four Seasons. The deluxe twin room was more than adequate in size with a luxurious bathroom. The breakfast buffet left you spoilt for choice with something to please everyone. I particularly liked the quiet pool which is for adults only and the family pool for those staying with children seemed to me a perfect solution to the issue of children in an adults pool. Food is reasonably priced for a 5 star hotel and the staff are really wonderful. I had a late flight so as I checked out at 11:00am I asked if they could store my luggage somewhere I was immediately offered a complimentary late checkout until 4:00pm which was very useful. I like Marrakech for a short break as it only a 3hour + flight from the UK on my next visit I will definitely stay at the Four Seasons-Oh and by the way the beds are just heavenly,Date of stay: September 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Kidderminster, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/David-RR

Our room was cleaned every day we were given fresh water in the room each day and our beds were turned down every evening when we returned. The bathroom was lovely; two sinks so lots of space a huge tub and a fantastic shower. The shower gels and shampoo were such good quality as well.    There are two pools to choose from a family pool where you can rent inflatables and have ice cream or an adult pool with a bar and food which can be served poolside.  The poolside attendants were great as well they would help with everything including moving those pesky umbrellas!    The food served poolside and at breakfast was top quality. Th breakfast buffet was vast ranging from pastries to a full english to Moroccan dishes.  The bar was also well staffed and they were very good bartenders as they made us our requests which weren't even on the menu!    They made my family and I feel incredibly welcome and like no request was too small or too trivial. They even gave me a cake on my birthday and some cava.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,celebrationtiger wrote a review Sep 2014,50,Amex and Four Seasons are a Winners,The combination of American Express Platinum and The Four Seasons once again made for a winning combination. We received a double upgrade to a lovely Executive suite with two bathrooms( each with a shower)  a wonderful full buffet breakfast with excellent smoked salmon  omelettes made by an on site chef and 70 E towards a spa experience. I used mine toward a massage and it was great . We actually used the late 4pm check out as our plane was at 7pm.    Adding to the pleasure was Amina front desk manager who was charming  well informed and professional . Among other things she helped to arrange a delightful day trip to Essaouira  on the coast. Numerous staff addressed us by our names and even pronounced it correctly. That kind of detail is reflective of the entire operation. The hotel is light and beautifully decorated.    We appreciated that you could order a glass of wine for a reasonable price ($(11.00) in the restaurant. We found two other hotel restaurants of similar caliber charged more than double and it seemed like the other hotels were gouging. However Mini Bar prices in the room might be reviewed. 270 Mad ($30) for an ordinary half bottle of wine seemed excessive as did about $ 8 for a Coke. By the way Cokes can be bought all over town for 6 MAD  about 75 cents.    They have a lovely tower bar/restaurant facing the Atlas mountains. There are also free transfers from 6 in the evening to any of the local hotels and restaurants in the hotel’s Mercedes.  They seem to have thought of everything to make for a very enjoyable stay even having reliable and friendly taxi drivers. I really liked Said. His prices were always reasonable and there was no reason to haggle. Haggling can be a sport in Morocco.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,LouJ1001 wrote a review Sep 2014,50,perfect oasis,arrived at 10.30pm to be greeted by speedy check-in which was really appreciated. The room was stunning - huge bedroom double doors opening into double sink walk in shower bath and separate toilet then a separate dressing room - all with balcony with table and chairs and small day bed - and we were in the cheapest room! - so we would have expected the view to be overlooking the bins...but no - over looked the main fountain area in centre of hotel surrounded by palm trees - very nice.    breakfast was buffet style - but fresh bread being made in front or seated area and fresh omelettes made to order - then any think else you could possibly want. All to superb quality and service was impeccable.    There are 2 pools - the family one being the largest but when we were there we were the only ones around the family pool - and we didn't have children! The adult pool has soft music in the background faces to a casual bar and restaurant which was great to sit and have a drink - or you could ask one of the couple of staff around the pool for anything you wanted and they would bring to your sunbed. Fresh towels aplenty - and when you went for a dip - a dry fresh towel would be folded on the end of your sunbed. The staff would bring round fresh pineapple on cocktails sticks glasses of minted cooled water - you could have iced water in any supply.    They gym was large - not the usual 2 running machines and a rower - but a fully kitted gym with separate stretch / free weight rooms. The showers / changing rooms here were large - with lockers bottles of water apples tea / coffee towels mouth wash combs etc. This also doubles up as the late check-out changing area - which is set on the edge of the hotel grounds - but concierge would drive you round in the electric golf buggy at any time (and pick you up again!)    There are lots of areas to sit sunbathe relax - all beautifully designed and the flow from one area to the other really worked. This is a larger hotel - but the way the grounds are designed it still manages that intimate and personal feel.    The staff could not do enough for us - including getting us taxis into town - and giving us bottles of iced water to take with us.    Highly recommended.    not hotel related - but may be worth noting:  Taxis from the airport were 100Mdh (about £10) and into town from hotel 50Mdh. ALWAYS agree a price before getting in -otherwise you will have to pay what they demand at the end of the journey which could be £50! We were told 300Mdh from the airport but we stuck our ground and after 5 mins they agreed 100Mdh. Don't be put off by haggling for taxis (or anything) - we got there at night and just said 'OK we'll walk' - that's when they agreed 100!  Also - we (2 girls) were not bothered by anyone in markets - dress respectfully - most of the locals are genuine and will help if you get lost in the souks!,Date of stay: September 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LouJ1001

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,london1332 wrote a review Aug 2014,50,Lovely stay in an interesting but slightly hectic city,Four Seasons is a fantastic place to relax and 'chill out' as it has everything on offer; two swimming pools restaurants kids club etc. Our double suite was huge and wonderfuly decorated with all the amenities you would expect from such a hotel. However as a family we did agree that on the whole the hotel needs to 'tighten up' in certain areas. We did have a delicious barbecue supper one evening with both fish and meat being offered (the Italian restaurant was closed) however the breakfast on offer does not match the ones offered at other Four Seasons hotels. We wondered whether this was in part due to it being low season. The other point was the service when on a number of minor occasions it could have been improved. For example asking 5/6 times for a shade and fresh towels when we arrived at the pool and multiple waiters asking us for our orders and then mixing up our order. We were also slightly disappointed when after a 1.5 hour wait at customs and arriving at the hotel tired and late in the evening they seemed reluctant to serve us which one would not have expected from an international hotel. However these are very minor points - when staying at most hotels you would note even bother noting these but it just seemed the hotel in certain areas was not quite up to the extremely high standards of other Four Seasons.,Date of stay: July 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/london1332

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,JanieC51 wrote a review Aug 2014,50,"World class hotel, world class pool",Marrakech can be quite overwhelming on first visit. We would go to the souk or to the Atlas Mountains and then come back to this very calming oasis. A swim in the pool at the end of the day was just what we needed to feel refreshed and ready to go exploring again the next day. Actually there are two pools: one for children and families and one for adults. Being a lap swimmer I really appreciated the calm of the adult pool. And the occasional free treat by the pool. One day it was coconut ice cream! I also loved the morning buffet especially the omelet. And the Moroccan restaurant made me a love of tajine! Perhaps the most professional service ever.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,chris5588 wrote a review Aug 2014,50,The best in the city,Overall this hotel is true to the Four Seasons brand. The rooms are spacious the hotel was not too busy (although it was July) and the staff were very friendly albeit maybe a bit laxidasical with a few things (pool staff seemed inattentive at times). No real qualms though. If staying and eating at the hotel for breakfast the choices can get quite repetitive however and is limited to a buffet style. This all being said the property is expansive luxurious and spacious. Certainly the place to stay when traveling to a city like Marrakesh.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Cassie B wrote a review Jul 2014,30,Other Hotels are better for a true Marrakech experience,I'm a huge fan of the Four Seasons and booked a room here because of their quality service/quality standards. This hotel was fine; it had a beautiful modern lobby and nice pools. But the rooms were a little small and honestly not as authentic as I'd hoped. This felt like a resort erected out of the outskirts of the old city and was a pretty good distance from everything else. If you're a honeymooning couple this might be a good choice if you just plan to stay on the grounds the whole time but I wasn't interested in that and comparative to the other hotels in the area like La Sultana or La Mammounia it lacked.,Date of stay: July 2014,,"Los Angeles, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/56cassieb
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Karen J wrote a review Jul 2014,50,"Beautiful, representative and comfortable","The Four Seasons in Marrakech is not only another gorgeous property it is designed to incorporate delightful aspects of the regional architecture and décor. And the gardens. As in many other parts of Morocco there were roses everywhere. EVERYWHERE!  My room wasn't ready on my arrival after 15 hours of traveling but I was made comfortable and cared for while I waited. My first introduction to mint tea and the dramatic serving technique were indeed a great welcome. I needed that.    The grounds are spacious. I loved the separate family pool. No scrimping on design between the adults only pool and the family pool but it was lovely to have a choice of ""activity"" level.    The rooms were very comfortable. I loved both our private terrace and the spacious balcony our friends had with their suite.    The staff were gracious and helpful but never intrusive. In fact they were seldom seen.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,pete66266 wrote a review Jul 2014,40,second time very good except,Hi    We as a family stayed 3nights for the second time and it was great. We spent most of the time by the pool as we already been sight seeing etc last time.    Breakfast was good (PS just ask and they will see if they can make it. I love my pancakes. However they were frequently burnt this time ??). Evening buffet was OK but am not a fan of marrocan food not enough spice. However the grill is good. Deserts again not my taste really. Maybe they could add a little non-marrocan food??    Overall good. Only issue which I had was  1) pool service befor 11am and when the main pool guy is absent (Friday) is terrible. You can not get drinks and genral service. I had to go find someone or even used a phone. Not major issue as I liked the walk with the nice views. However means less drinks consumed ?? Again the pool food was not amazing and slow. Thinking about it we didn't even get regular cold water which they do at every FS. I think this is because Ramadan as the staff could be on a go slow which is why I didn't really voice my concerns    2) I had the feeling they gave use the worse room and then showed us a better room at a small upgrade. Guess it's a good trick lol and it worked. But I requested they give use free high speed WiFi. However this really only worked in the room well. And I notice a lot of restrictions in that country. Ie no blinkbox??    3) A useless life guard. I would not trust him with my kids. He looked fed up lol. Anyway he annoyed me the first day so guess I had a chip on my shoulder. We was at the kids pool. I requested a ice booket and food menu (no one else around to request) . He said that was fine and 30min later nothing. So I went back and told it was coming. Another 30min and my partner goes and asks. She came back saying he being rude etc?? . so I had enough and complained to front desk. But this didn't really change any during our stay. Same life guard no other person around. What can you do??    3). OK before I came to FS I made a promise I will have the best choc milkshake I had before. However even this has changed it was a plain milkshake. No choc chips or almonds :( . little cut backs make all the difference    I guess am moaning about little things but when u had the best before anything else is second best. So let's keep it the best please FS manager as I would like to come back    Thanks,Date of stay: July 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,birmingham,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pete66266

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,FCSX wrote a review Jun 2014,50,Absolutely Faultless,We visited for a week in June and almost felt like we had the place to ourselves - it was peaceful and tranquil with just a pleasant amount of guests around the place. This is a stunning hotel made even more amazing by the staff who could not do enough for you whether you wanted a car/taxi down to cleaning your sunglasses for you by the pool! Nothing is too much trouble.    The room we occupied had two small double beds a walk in wardrobe huge bathroom (with separate WC) and the deepest bath I have ever had the pleasure to use. Kettle and hairdryer in room.    There is an adult only pool and that was strictly adhered to. The separate children's pool is also as beautiful as the adult pool. The pools are stunning and with their grey slate//stone tiles makes you feel like you are swimming in a natural pool.    Prices for food and drink are what you would expect from such a hotel. Lots of choice of places to eat within the hotel: at your sun-lounger pool restaurant sports bar Italian restaurant and terrace and main restaurant and terrace with buffet for breakfast and Moroccan buffet each evening.    The hotel is a five minute ride by taxi to the main square and Souks (costing about £3.50) so that works well as you get the hustle and bustle of that but then feel you can escape to the oasis that is this hotel after each trip out. We used the car service offered by the hotel for a day in the Atlas Mountains - not cheap but a very safe and good driver who gave us a good flavour of the area.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Norbert B wrote a review Jun 2014,40,"Not a Riad, but an excellent choice in Marrakech","The variety of accommodations in Marrakech is extremely large. Authentic Riads in the Medina Golf-Resorts outside town classic hotels and resorts like the Four Seasons. For us combining the high level of service and room quality with the relative proximity to the city was important. But don't stay here if you are looking for a Riad...    The property is huge virtually 7 minutes from the airport and 5 from the old town (both by cab depending on your negotiation skills expect to spend anywhere between 30 and 100 Dirham). The gardens are exceptional almost like a botanical garden and they offer a variety of restaurants two pools (one ""quiet"") two bars spa and everything else you'd expect from a FS.    We had an Executive Suite in one of the wings huge bathroom large balcony. The room was very well appointed. One could not stay on the balcony during the morning (no enough shade) however. Additionally the AirCon in the bedroom had to be switched off at night given the draft that was directly towards the bed. Fortunately it wasn't too hot and there are ceiling fans but that is an issue.    Housekeeping was superb with a nice decoration for my wife's birthday excellent turn down. Also we left the in-suite safe open one day and it was closed by security for us and nothing was missing.    One of the few drawbacks: The hotel offers a service to the Djama el Fna in the early evening but is was never really clear how that works. Once they put is in a limousine another time we had to take a cab. Should be sorted out. Also front desk had us waiting almost 10 minutes once as everybody seemed busy with other tasks.    Breakfast ist buffet-style and although of excellent quality a bit rushed and very expensive. Take a cab to ""La Place"" and have a local breakfast coffee and croissant instead while watching the scene.    The pools are wonderful but can be busy and there a guests reserving a whole row of deck chairs early before breakfast something normally observed in all-inclusive places not in a FS. Although many kids in the hotel the ""quoted"" pool was really quiet. Families have their own playground.    Good lunch at the poolside restaurant and a first class mediterranean place next to it. The roof-top bar was somewhat quiet as was the bar in the main building in general guests seem to be in their rooms early. So if you are looking for some nightlife go elsewhere.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,BraddyNrFrome wrote a review Jun 2014,50,Excellent service as one would expect with the Four seasons,Another excellent stay at a four seasons hotel. Facilities excellent and service as you would expect nothing too much trouble. Food good but nit exceptional and the choice especially at lunch was a little restricted. we stayed over half term and as you would expect their were a lot of children Which is something that you may need to consider. There was a separate family pool although noise levels from excited children were quite high.    Good location for the airport and getting into centre of town. Taxis don't have meters and you need to ensure that you have agreed a price before setting off. An excellent destination but think a week is enough. But an excellent relaxing time.,Date of stay: May 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Mells, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BraddyNrFrome
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Mark K wrote a review Jun 2014,50,What a first trip to Marrakech truly made by our stay here.....,We have just returned from 4 nights from this amazing hotel with our 9 year old son. As one expects from Four Seasons first class service (from the moment you are collected from the airport) fantastic location close to the City Centre stunning and such tranquil grounds and superb food throughout (albeit we did hear that the Moroccan buffet seemed overpriced we did not try this). The staff certainly make this hotel there were too many mention but I will single out Myriam who was superb with tips and recommendations outside of the hotel. We had a lovely Executive Room with an amazing balcony located close to the young adult centre (our son spent a lot of time here - pool table football table tennis basketball Wi X Box etc.) and the fabulous family pool. We loved the roof top Morrocan terrace bar the lobby bar / restaurant the Italian restaurant and the Azzera Grill (at lunchtimes). The courtesy cars which take you into the City anytime between 6&10pm are superb as is negotiating your way home with the local taxi drivers ! We enjoyed our horse and carriage trip around the Medina / City Centre and can thoroughly recommend the Pearl (for roof terrace drinks at sun set one of the best views of Marrakech) the Le Grand de La Poste restaurant and the amazing roof terrace restaurant at La Sultana - you must have a walk around this collection of stunning riads. The hotel is not cheap but it's Four Seasons and you pay for what you get in terms of service nothing is too much trouble. The complimentary wifi is always well received too (unlimited devices) although this may have been part of our room package. The only downside was the old towel problem at the pool it was half term so it was busy and it still baffles / annoys me that people put towels down at 8:30am in the morning and do not use the beds for 5 hours (people next to us) this cannot continue when the hotel is busy and when families are looking for sun beds. Also thought the pool bar service was a little slow at times but these minor negatives will not stop us from returning in the future sometime. Big thanks to all the staff at this Four Seasons our son James wants to return tomorrow.....PS the breakfast is awesome!!!,Date of stay: May 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/80MarkK

The hotel could be crumbling and falling apart around you(which it isn't by any means!!) and you wouldn't care as the staff look go out of their way to look after you so well. The whole resort is beautifully laid and out and kept in fantastic order. being only ten minutes (maximum) drive from the airport is another huge plus too. It's a true oasis of calm and luxury.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Sunny traveller wrote a review May 2014,50,Calm retreat,I have stayed in a raid in Marrakech before but as I was coming with my family this time for 5 days we wanted to have a pool and go more 'resort' style. The Four Seasons was the perfect spot. Not only is is 10 mins from the airport making it a very easy destination for a shorter break sometime but it is also a very short cab ride into the hustle and bustle of the centre if town. We therefore had time to lay by pool during hotter part of day and on to the Souks etc later.    The bedrooms were as one would expect from a Four Seasons hotel. Comfortable beds luxurious bathrooms - space and noise free air con.    The food and service in the hotel was in the main fabulous. The pool attendants at your side in the blink of an eye. The Italian restaurant was stunning with morrocan lanterns reflecting on the terrace and creating a lovely ambience.    The main restaurant at similar ambience in the evening however during my visit the service a little disappointing.    In the main however the hotel could not do enough to please us. My daughter was a little ill when we arrived and being there made all the difference to us as had we been more in the centre of town I think it would have felt a little stressful. She was able to relax outside in the spacious pool area and gardens in the shade and enjoy her holiday.    I will definitely return there when I next visit the red city.,Date of stay: May 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,london,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/caz1000

The site is stunning it is 5 minutes away (taxi) from Marrakech centre.  The gardens are beautiful.  You have the choice between 3 different restaurants and this is the only small cloud in our stay the food was average and the choice limited even if service was good.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,voyager95 wrote a review May 2014,40,"""Morocco made over, Four Seasons style...""","For me a Four Seasons Hotel is like Tom Cruise : it looks good consistently delivers but authenticity is not its forte....    Seriously the resort is huge punctuated by pools manicured gardens and staff always willing to assist you. The resort is a short taxi ride from all the action in Marrakech. It is a new concept in itself : a hybrid between an oasis and a compound. You might enjoy the quiet luxurious isolation or it might give you anxiety. They have courtesy cars but forget about any discount on your ""babouches"" once you have been spotted stepping out of a monster black SUV at the Grande Place....    The staff I would say are great and are the strong point of the hotel. And yes if you have any non PC colonial fantasies or you fancy yourself as Jimmy Steward in ""A Man who knew too much"" they will indulge you...The spa is the other strong point of the resort. The therapists are busier than waxers before a Kardashian wedding so do book ahead. The masseurs are awesome: there is nothing like being told by a guy who looks like a wrestling champion that ""your chakras need to be opened""....    What is disappointing is that in spite of the enormous space the tables at the restaurants are quite close. There is no dress code so the guy about to propose to this uber glamorous girlfriend can have his moment ruined by some temperamental kid watching Little Mermaid on her Ipad nearby....The same applies poolside : the sun loungers are very close and you might find yourself put off by your neighbour's untidy bikini line...    I would say that if you really want to experience moroccan culture stay away from this plastic but beautiful extravaganza.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,JZ16 wrote a review May 2014,30,O.K. Not stellar,There's a reason that this resort is not rated more highly. I was traveling with a group of 30 women we checked in late on a Wednesday night. I was assigned an exterior room on the first floor ( as were several others.). Having read numerous trip advisor reviews I immediately asked for a reassignment to a higher. The only option was a twin room which was unacceptable to me (one of the joys of traveling is sleeping in a king size bed) so for four days I saw no sunlight. The bathrooms are luxurious (however you need to be agile getting in and out if the bathtubs) there is plenty of drawer and closet space but otherwise the room was average. Mine actually was smaller than others in the group. No desk for working. The area rug was spotted and needs to be replaced. The breakfast buffet is adequate for this caliber resort nothing exceptional except for the orange juice. The restaurant by the pool serves a varied menu the grilled shrimp was superb.,Date of stay: May 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"New York City, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JZ16

I chose it mostly for its pool because that was exactly what we wanted i.e. rest and enjoy some sun! while the rooms are very comfortable and in line with what you would expect from such a chain I have to say it was not as charming as one could have hoped. this was very contrasting with our first night in the ""palmeraie"" in an hotel very quaint with a real garden. Because that's the only problem of the four seasons resort it is a bit in the middle of nowhere you are dependent from taxis if you want to move around and don't expect nice landscapes around your hotel it's dull...Finally though the garden is lush it still looks too new...the plam trees just look as if they have been put there yesterday there is no grass to walk on.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Dora2602 wrote a review May 2014,50,Fabulous holiday experience in beautiful resort.,We are midway through our stay in Marrakech. I chose the four seasons as the group is my usual preference when traveling because of their standard of accommodation and service. We certainly have not been disappointed!  Granted the hotel possibly does not offer the most authentic Moroccan experience in terms of the decor. But the resort is stunning cleverly designed with beautiful features. The gardens are a credit perfectly maintained with flourishing planting wherever you look. The two pools are also beautiful large and spacious with very comfortable loungers.  There is a good choice of places to eat at lunch time the pool restaurant offers a good menu although the addition of a few traditional Moroccan dishes might be good. In the evening there is an Italian restaurant amazing Moroccan buffet and a bar menu. There is also an additional Indian night and Italian offering in the bar. We have tried all and all are fantastic. Breakfast is also very good.  Our room is large and comfortable with everything you could need a large closet minibar and kettle huge bathroom and loungers outside.  All fabulous - and to save the best until last the staff are ALL AMAZING! Right from the mint tea on arrival we have been made to feel welcome and at home with everyone offering smiles and assistance with everything you need. All of the waiters are so friendly and efficient and the pool guys could not be more helpful nor do more for you. Everyone on the concierge desk and reception are lovely and again will do all they can to help you. Housekeeping are thorough and happy too.

What I find really annoying is when you make a very specific request regarding your room reservation which is totally ignored. You then waste the 1st day of your break getting the issue rectified which did happen but you really expect better in a Four Seasons. Rooms are very comfortable with every amenity. Service needs tightening up it's all a bit hit and miss - especially pool service.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,eclipsemullet wrote a review Apr 2014,50,Fantastc,Four Seasons    We stayed here for a week in late March.    Check in: our taxi pulled up under the covered entrance and we were guided onto a red carpet and into the main communal area. We were given time to relax on a settee with a mint tea while the staff checked us in. Our rooms were upgraded and I was soon in 224.    Room: 224 is a large room with a big bathroom a huge deep bath and a separate excellent shower. Very comfy bed. Table and chairs. A separate dressing room. Wifi. Large flat screen TV with Sky News BBC World & Food Network. Bedside radio/iPod docking station. There is a hub under the TV to connect to the wired internet and charge iDevices etc. Overhead rotating fan.    The aircon had me stumped for a moment but I sussed it. The room had a balcony with settees but I didn't sit on it. The chambermaid service is excellent and I left a good tip.    Communal areas: everywhere is spotless and there's always a member of staff to ask for a coffee or a drink. I'm not into cut flowers but the rose display is special. Log fires are lit on chilly evenings. There is an attractive sitting room with a good selection of books on Morocco.    Food: on the first night we had the Moroccan Feast in the Solano Restaurant. Belly dancers appeared. Very impressive but we didn't do it justice.    We ate one night in the Last Call sports bar; beer and burgers are the order of the day here. There are four plasmas showing football and they will changed the channels for you to watch what you like.    Below the Last Call is the more formal Italian restaurant the Blue de Orange. Recommend for one night if you are there for a week.    Breakfast is great and is served every morning in the Solano restaurant. You can pretty much have anything you like. A great start to the day. There is a menu but you'll need to ask for it.    The pool-side restaurant is very nice. The food is perfect for a midday meal and an escape from the -sometimes- overpowering African sun.    Location: quite. 5 minute taxi ride to Jemaa el Fna square. The gardens are lovely and quiet with only the odd plane taking off take away from the near-total tranquility. The staff will get you a taxi and negotiate the price for you.    Facilities: lovely pool! Nicest pool I have come across. The lifeguard is really attentive. Plenty of loungers when we were there. Quite closely spaced but okay.    Two main pools; adults and a family pool. Also a jacuzzi pool with a waterfall adjacent to the adults pool.    Tented beds around the pool provide maximum shade. Lifeguard will position parasols for you.    Wifi is okay but didn't seem towork in the Solano restaurant. The hotel charged me incorrectly for the enhanced wifi service but immediately removed it when I pointed out that I didn't use it.    The Young Adults Centre is cool with pool table football computers (Macs & PCs) XBOX board games and a cinema. The member of staff will play you at pool if you like.    They have an ATM machine next to reception.    The concierge organised a trip to the Atlas Mountains with lunch at Kasbah Tamadot. They upgraded us to a Range Rover which was appreciated.    Staff/Service: A-mazing! We came away thinking this is +the best+ service and staff we have ever come across. The couldn't have been more friendly and helpful. Simply awesome.

This is the place to stay if you want to visit Marrakech but dont want to feel gross/dirty/crowded/overwhelmed. It is about 5 min cab from Medina (center of town) and the setting of the hotel makes you feel like youre in an exotic country. The restaurants are just ok (food not great/over priced) and the spa is just ok (overpriced). But the room service is ON POINT. The rooms are spacious very large bathrooms great products very clean very quiet and very nice hotel staff. Very reasonable rooms also at about $400/night.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Richard C wrote a review Mar 2014,50,A most satisfying week!,"Context - we stayed seven nights at the beginning of February - being very lucky with the weather we were able to enjoy the pool area of the hotel most days as well as using many of the hotel amenities restaurants and going on two excursions recommended by the hotel (not pre-booked).    Room (ground floor) classic decor all modern amenities comfortable AC worked well (vital!) and bed wonderfully comfortable. All staff superbly friendly and service was great. Pool area delightful - separate pool for small ones was most welcome.    Restaurant slightly limiting - breakfast menu could have been more imaginative and wide ranging and Moroccan restaurant could have had greater choice - one could get ""Moroccan'd out"" before too long! And the other restaurant (Italian) had similar limiting menu. But no issue with quality of food and beverages.

More like a small resort than a hotel the property and grounds are beautiful. I was in a Deluxe bedroom which was very spacious and luxurious with a cute balcony and modern amenities. The staff were really what made the experience exceptional though - from the warm welcome as I arrived to the friendly goodbye each member of staff I encountered was warm friendly and willing to do absolutely anything to make my stay perfect.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Worlwide wrote a review Mar 2014,50,Better than previous reviews suggested,The Four Seasons Resort in Marrakesh is a large and sprawling hotel with rooms both connected to the main hotel and in ‘pavillons’ around the landscaped grounds. A map is provided at check in but it is quite impossible to follow and when I asked the concierge to mark where my room was on the map after long deliberation she still got it wrong!    Our room in the main area of the hotel was spacious with an entry hall walk in dressing area and large bathroom with separate toilet and bidet  as well as the large high ceilinged bedroom and sitting area. A sliding door opened onto a terrace with loungers and day bed and a private garden area the perfect setting for work I had to do disturbed only by birdsong. The buffet breakfast was included in our tariff. It was excellent.    The main room was pleasantly unspectacular adequately furnished for all needs with tea making facilities and bottled water supplied daily. It is however inadequately lit. The high double beds were the most comfortable I have slept in anywhere. There is no folder giving information about hotel services restaurants meal times etc. in the room but I have been told it was available on the television. As I did not come to Marrakesh to watch television I did not discover it. Housekeeping was friendly and there is an evening turndown.    The bathroom has double sinks a large powerful shower and a bath so deep and wide my children could have swum in it. There is an illuminated magnifying mirror and a hairdryer. Toiletries are L’Occitane (no bath oil) and all other personal needs bathrobes slippers and lots of towels are provided. A vase of roses was placed on the vanity. Again though lighting was inadequate.    Staff are well trained willing pleasant and smiling. Public areas are spacious and at least while we were there roses were displayed everywhere. There is a very nice indoor/outdoor bar - but check the bill as ours was incorrect. The grounds are landscaped and well cared for and there is a large heated swimming pool. There is a beautiful spa and whilst the girl who did my pedicure was not slickly professional she was very nice anxious to please and did a good job. However about £80 for a basic pedicure did not encourage me to have other treatments.    Several Trip Advisor reports have complained the hotel is not up to the standard of other Four Seasons hotels. Whilst there were slight ‘niggles’ - the terrace door was hard to lock one of the bath taps was sticky one bathroom door sprung open - I’m sure that if I had complained they would have been fixed.,Date of stay: March 2014,Trip type: Traveled on business,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Worlwide

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,sgowarty wrote a review Mar 2014,50,Everything you would expect!,"We arrived to The Four Seasons Marrakech after spending 3 days in the Sahara. Greeted with cool towels and mint tea definitely put me in a refreshed mood after our 9 hour drive. Our Villa poolside second floor was very gorgeous. The walk in closet was huge and stored all of our clothes and luggage so they did not sprawl across the room GIGANTIC bathroom - with wonderful bath products. Our king bed was extremely comfortable and linens were soft. A sprawling terrace with padded lounge chairs to absorb the delicious afternoon and evening breezes was perfect. We often slept with the door open and enjoyed the breeze and I loved listening to the Prayer Call from a nearby mosque. So beautiful.    We ate primarily at the pool restaurant during the afternoon. And I cannot lie after having many tangines we were ""tangine'd out"" and REALLY enjoyed the burger and fries!!    Service was top notch concierge always hepful.    Ambiance - fresh roses - EVERYWHERE!!!    I loved the gorgeous light fixtures and lamps - a very romantic atmosphere. In fact we found a local craftsman in the souk who designs for lamps for hotels and purchased one. When it is on at night - you can see a beautiful patterned design from the shade on the ceiling and it makes me think of the wonderful Moroccan nights we had.    About 40-50 dirhams for a 10 minute cab rideto the Medina. Always ask a cab when returning back to The Four Seasons the price - and keep that price in mind. Most likely you will be charged double if you don't agree before hand. We took a tour of the Medina and Souk with a guide and then navigated on our own the next day. There is no rhyme or reason in the Souk - wander and lose yourself inside - you will eventually find your way to the main square.    I would be so lucky to return to Marrakech one day.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Onceisnotenough30 wrote a review Mar 2014,40,"Beautiful hotel, but...",We spent here 3 nights. Hotel is superb beautiful well kept gardens nice pools. The room was big spacious bright with a nice big bathroom.  Hotel lobby is lovely has tens of vases full of thousands beautiful pink and red roses.  We were actually given an upgrade by the hotel as we had booked a deluxe room (situated in the hotel building) and at check-in they gave us a pavilion room this being actually located in one of the villas.  The room was very nice as I said but the walls waaay too thin (one afternoon I wanted to take a nap but the housekeeping next-door was so loud I couldn t sleep). I actually went out and asked them three times to be a bit less noisy but the women from housekeeping didn t seem to care about my request they went on laughing talking and slamming doors…  The bed mattress was too soft not me nor my husband could sleep well. And there were no teaspoons in the minibar (only some plastic sticks) which as a matter of fact is unacceptable for a 5 star hotel. There also was no milk for the coffee.  Gym is very nice also the spa is nice has good therapists. Restaurants serve good food the sports bar was nice good service.  Staff is very helpful smiling and nice but somehow chaotic. Also they do not understand much English and their directions (through the resort) may be misleading. They also may completely mess up your order (bringing you the wrong wine for instance it happened to us in the Azera Grill restaurant). They should simply have said they do not speak English as my French is pretty good…These matters are no big deal of course in a 3 star resort but not in a Four Seasons as their prices are high and they simply do not live up to their name...

It is outside the old walled city in a stand-alone resort setting. That is one of its great charms but also its greatest drawback. If you are traveling to Marrakech for the lovely weather and plan to sit by one of the pools relax in the quiet of this lovely oasis and enjoy the fabulous spa this is the place for you. If on the other hand you are interested in experiencing the sights sounds smells and feel of the old city try something inside the Medina.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Britannia07 wrote a review Mar 2014,40,Mostly Very Good,Wonderfully close to the airport/city centre but not blighted by noise this is the perfect location for a quiet stay in Marrakech.  In most respects this is a very good holiday hotel only let down by minor niggles.  Our accommodation was comfortable and the linen of a good quality but the room service was very uneven. On the first day the suite was not serviced until early afternoon which got us off to a bad start. A deeply irritating issue was room service tapping on the door to make up the sofa bed and turn down the room every evening just when we were sitting on the sofa to enjoy a drink at 7pm - it took most of the week to instil that after 20.00hrs was our preferred time. Glasses were not replaced when removed and both tea mugs had large chips in them. The other annoyance with the room was the breakdown in wifi for most of our stay and the fact that no one communicated the fact that the service was available in the reception area.  On the plus side our suite had a lovely sun filled terrace and garden the gym and attendants there are excellent the grounds and general feel of the hotel are as you would expect.  The restaurants - Bleu d'Orange serves delicious food and has an excellent manager but what a shame that very young children who clearly want to be asleep are admitted. The pop up Indian restaurant was fun but we felt that the Moroccan buffet restaurant was expensive. Breakfast is efficiently staffed and offers a wonderful range of hot and cold food - sadly it was just a bit too chilly for us to sit outside to enjoy it.,Date of stay: February 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,channel islands,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Britannia07

The staff were superb always willing to go to any length to make our stay as perfect as possible even to the extent of packing our souk purchases in a well insulated box ready for the flight home! We were upgraded to a Pavilion room in the gardens completely quiet luxurious and comfortable. Having had the buffet breakfast for 2 mornings we would highly recommend the A la Carte option as the dishes are freshly prepared delicious and worked out more reasonably priced. We had dinner in Bleu d'Orange and Inara Bar and Lounge several times and all the meals were very good. The Moroccan Buffet in the Solano Restaurant was disappointing and expensive. Lunch (and regular coffees) at the Azzara Grill were excellent. The adult only pool was wonderful especially as we were there during Moroccan school half term. The pool attendants were delightful extremely helpful and regularly plied us with little refreshments. The location for us was perfect 10 mins from airport and the Medina and although we loved the buzz and chaos of the Medina it was sheer bliss to return to the oasis of calm (and fresh air) of the resort. Wifi is patchy and could be frustrating for those for whom this is vital during your stay. The hotel is trying to sort this out at the moment we had no wifi for a couple of days as they had complications while trying to improve the service. It wasn't a big deal for us and Nick the hotel Manager was extremely apologetic. Any small problems like wine glasses not returned after servicing our room were immediately sorted.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Noel H wrote a review Feb 2014,40,No smoke without ire,It didn't get off to an auspicious start. Dull weather encouraging guests to decamp to the lounge and light up. I asked the lounge attendant if smoking was allowed and he said it was not hotel policy so when it happened later I spoke irately with Nick the hotel manager who patiently explained that while it is discouraged there are no laws prohibiting it in Morocco. This makes it difficult for the superb staff to balance demands of clearly competing guests' interests which was alleviated when the sun came out as the splendid outside terrace with its lemon trees and stunning views of the Atlas Mountains could be used by smokers. The legendary four seasons service was in evidence all week and even though there are only two restaurants plus the lounge there was real inventiveness about the changing menu themes. I do wish that they wouldn't serve doughnuts at the breakfast platter but only because my children gorged on them rather than the splendid fruits and great egg selection but that says more about my ability to persuade my children to eat what is good for them. The pools where great and when one got fed up with the family pool  a quick swim in the adult pool was like a spa treatment in itself. Talking of which  one the best spas I've been to though the little boutique shop which is along side it is underwhelming in what it stocks but overwhelming in the service it brings including finding me a temporary pair of sun glasses for the many sets I forget to pack.

Our group of more than 150 persons arrived after 11pm nearly 5 hours after our expected arrival. Even so the hotel staff was waiting for us. We were greeted with delicious mint tea. Check-in was handled efficiently with two tables set up in the lobby (not the check-in area) for our key distribution. By the time we got to our room half of our luggage was already there (and the rest arrived a short time later). Our group was in Morocco for a conference. Because of our size a ballroom was used to serve our daily breakfast which included an omelette station. The hotel property covers a huge area. The grounds are beautiful and need to be explored. Everyone was pleasant and doing all to make us feel very welcome. This was particularly important since you realize that many of the staff did not speak English but they smiled warmly. The hotel was not a long distance from tourist attractions and shopping and hotel staff was very good about arranging transportation. Our standard room was large with a very relaxing seating area outside the sliding doors. The large bathroom contained a deep soaking tub and a rainfall showerhead. This Four Seasons did not disappoint. It is definitely worth a return stay.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,47carlosm wrote a review Feb 2014,50,Service really makes the difference,Maybe there are better located hotels but we would really come back if Marrakesh comes into our travel plans again.  Things did not start well. We were not picked up by a Range Rover as arranged but by a van instead same when we went to dinner that night. The next morning same van was waiting. A quick complain with the concierge was enough to get the Range Rover through the whole stay.  The Pavilion suite is roomy with two full bathrooms but ours was at the end of a long corridor our private garden and sun bathing area facing a wall... The hotel was almost empty so why do that? I did complain the next day but since we had unpacked I told front desk I did not want to change.  The above would normally make me give an average rating but during the stay we noticed how staff made their best to make our stay the best possible.  During our 4 day stay we noticed small things which are important. When going to the breakfast buffet for another round previous plate was quickly removed and a new set of silver was placed on the table. Most of times in other hotels we have to ask waiter for a new set...  We wanted to have dinner at the hotel Italian restaurant but it was closed on Monday (so as Sunday) so since we did not want Moroccan food we had two options either go out or eat again at the hall restaurant with a very limited menu. Since room service had a larger menu I asked to order from that menu. After a quick authorization from the manager we had what we wanted. Waiters were simply fantastic especially because they did know the dishes they kept the chef on the phone so they could explain them to us not mentioning the warm smile of the lovely waitress. My wife and I were really happy.  Bellmen and drivers were all polite nice and helpful. House keeping just perfect. Concierge arranged for a full time guide Abdul a very good and educated guide. By the way prices in Medina are much higher than in the new city stores.  When driving us to the airport the hotel driver like in most Asian countries took us to the check in and handled luggage and boarding passes. I do recommend this hotel.,Date of stay: February 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Lisbon, Portugal",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/47carlosm

The Moroccan architecture and the riad design is lovely The staff were the friendliest I have seen anywhere else always greeting you with a smile rooms are lovely and clean with great views. We loved the design of the bathroom with the unusual looking bath tub. The hotel premises is huge and there are places to relax everywhere the poolside the garden the cultural center. I cannot say enough about the spa its lovely be sure to do the Moroccan hamman before you leave or just simply enjoy the Jacuzzi and the warm ambience of the place.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,HawaiianIndian wrote a review Jan 2014,40,"great stay, limited breakfast",We stayed at this hotel as part of a group (50 people) from Jan 10-14 2014 and overall our stay was excellent. The deluxe room we had was very spacious the bed/pillows comfortable and the bathroom extra large and comfortable. The added bonus of a walk-in closet was very handy.    The attention to detail at the hotel was seen throughout our stay from the welcome goodies left for our 3 yr old son on his child bed to the service of the famous Moroccan mint tea served in the lobby area around the clock.    Room service and housekeeping were top notch - fast efficient and very friendly.    The only downside to our stay was the breakfast buffet. Although the food was tasty there wasn't much variety day after day. We had 4 breakfasts at the hotel and the menu was the same for all of the mornings. The spread included an omelet station array of pastries and breads fruits cereals and hot dishes but a bit of variety would have been appreciated.    We didn't have a chance to use the kids center or the pool (since we were on a tight schedule with our group) but I'm sure it would have been super based on the walks we made around the vast property.    I'd definitely recommend the hotel to anyone staying in Marrakech.,Date of stay: January 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,Hawaii/Bangalore,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HawaiianIndian

The service was impeccable delicious food with a very professional restaurant manager - Charles. The staff at the Spa were particularly special in their welcome and after visiting many Spa's around Europe I can say without doubt the Four Seasons Marrakech have a very special team.  The hotel organised an Apero evening which allowed us to meet other guests and staff over some food and drinks highlighting again a very personal touch which we thoroughly enjoyed.

I find the hotel amazing - the overall architecture and design are so good and the gardens are absolutely beautiful. These are one of the best that I have seen in Morocco.  The service is perfect the staff are helpful and polite the rooms are spacious and beautifully decorated. The breakfast is generous and tasty. I find very important also is the feeling of relaxation even when you're there for work. I would like to extend my greetings to the staff of the hotel for their efforts to make everybody to feel at ease as much as possible. As I said the only problem was my too short visit there.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Gabriella620 wrote a review Jan 2014,50,Dreamy and immaculate resort and grounds,I stayed here at the Four Seasons for work a few months ago and our conference was also held here. On the business side the facilities were beautiful and the staff couldnt be more accommodating to participants.  The guest rooms were modern and comfortable with gorgeous Moroccan style. The local sweets as a welcome gift were a nice touch and the bathroom with a rain shower large tub and l'Occitane bath products was luxurious. And this is a very small thing but I loved how you could dim the lights in the bathroom and room. A personal patio with comfy chairs right outside our bedroom doors made a great place to sit in the evening or early morning with coffee.  The food was amazing a blend of Middle Eastern Mediterranean and international cuisine such as American pancakes or French macaroons.  One of the other amazing aspects of the resort is the decor and the attention to detail in terms of how the furnishings accents and color pallets were selected. Every other day a selection of fresh roses are placed in all common spaces and it really fills the air. Another nice touch.  Lastly the staff are attentive and very hospitable.  If your priorities in Marrakech are luxury and service this is the place for you. If you want to be in touch with the culture and the core of the city I suggest finding a quaint riad in the old town.,Date of stay: October 2013,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Rome, Italy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gabriella620
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Cynthia R wrote a review Jan 2014,50,Much Improved!,I stayed here soon after it opened which was simply too soon. Two years later I have only good things to report from the much needed rest I found on FS signature beds to the impressive breakfast buffets every morning where attentive staff knew to bring my green tea every day after the first request. I especially LOVED the spa treatments I had a few and the fantastic Indian yoga instructor. I very rarely take a hotel's yoga class because they are just not suitable for someone who practices seriously but this was refreshingly different -- I can't wait to go back for more.    Managers were walking around the property making sure guests were being taken care of and that all was in good order. The concierge made some great dining recommendations outside the hotel and the staff made sure my taxi knew exactly where to take me each time I left the property.    For anyone who wants to explore the exoticism of Marrakech but wants a little certainty in their luxury hotel while they are being adventurous in all other aspects of their stay this is the place for you as well as for any doing business in Marrakech as I was because everything works here so smoothly which can't always be said about everything else in Morocco.,Date of stay: November 2013,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Paris, France",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PoppyHopper
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,LondonRoamer23 wrote a review Jan 2014,50,FABULOUS HOTEL,Beautifully kept and maintained property. Stunning grounds to stroll through and to enjoy the gardens. The swimming pools are great. Two very large ones. The first intended to be family oriented and the other called the quiet pool. Both were lovely. Wonderful pool service and opulent sunbeds towels and cabines for sun-worshippers.  Two excellent clay tennis courts and a resident coach The Fitness centre ( free ) was very luxurious with many state of the art exercise machines and a separate weights room.  Housed in a different building in the grounds was the Spa featuring saunas hammams Jacuzzi plunge pools ( all free ) and leading into treatment rooms for every imaginable beauty and massage treatments in elegant surroundings.  The hotel is an oasis in Marrakech in a district/suburb called the Hivernage just outside the centre of Marrakech. A taxi takes you to the main square in 5/7 minutes at a cost of £4. A walk there is 25mins.    Accommodation at the hotel is luxurious. I had a Pavilion room which was incredibly spacious with very large bathroom and walk-in wardrobe. Giving on to a large balcony. The beds are super-comfortable.  Rooms are either in the grounds of the resort ( Pavilion rooms ) or in the main hotel complex. It takes only two mins or less to get to the main complex from Pavilion rooms.    Beautiful and elegant public rooms bars and spaces. Reasonable choice of restaurants serving varied cuisines from Moroccan tagines and couscous and international fare to fine-dining options at the signature restaurant Bleu D'Orange.    Plenty to do and to occupy yourself with at this resort hotel and a great place to unwind after hectic sightseeing in the bustling old souks and main square.    Highly recommended. Of the standard you would expect from Four Seasons. Sophisticated international clientele. Extremely courteous and helpful staff throughout the property.    Not a hotel for those on a tight budget but a truly wonderful resort for a special treat or occasion or a well-deserved holiday.,Date of stay: December 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LondonRoamer23
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,The_Smalls_in_London wrote a review Jan 2014,50,Amazing stay at FS Marrakech,"My husband and I spent 10 days at the FS Marrakech with our two very young children (a pre-schooler and a baby). We have had a fantastic time.  My husband booked a suite in the villas which was perfect for accommodating a junior bed and cot bed. We had plenty of room for the four of us. We were also very well located near to the family pool kids club and spa and within the ""green area"" of the resort. This worked better than staying in the main building because of the children and the buggy.  The family pool was heated at 28C which meant our children went every single day! it was supervised so we didn't have to go with my eldest all the time and could watch the pool from our seats.    The kidsclub was excellent Nabila and Imane were fun and enthusiastic my eldest had a lot of fun and played within their soccer area and did a lot of crafts and obviously developed some cool friendship during the stay.    The spa was top notch although we are not experts. My husband and I really enjoyed all the treatments thanks to the professionalism and care of each of the therapists. The ambiance of the spa is not spectacular but we didn't mind as the importance resides in the treatment execution for us.    We tried at several occasions both the Moroccan and Italian restaurants and we were delighted each time and when it comes to food we are particularly difficult so it says a lot.    All the catering (restaurant and room service and pool food) was very accommodating with the children offering children menu and also purees for my baby. You don't pay the food for children that young which is very thoughtful.    The pool area was our favourite spot during our stay. We had such a relaxing time. Everytime we needed something we got some help and our requests were worked upon very swiftly and smoothly. By the 5th day all the staff knew our little habits and fads which is so nice when you are on holidays.  And we were very happy to leave our little ones to the kids club whilst enjoying our time off.  The guests were unassuming despite the prices of the rooms at xmas and new year's season and the general atmosphere around the pool and in restaurant is warm and relaxed.    The housekeeping was punctual reliable and smiling and attentive to the baby's items.  I had asked for childproofing before our arrival and I got the full treatment with the little pond completely gated a steriliser nappies supply etc etc. This means we didn't have to travel with too many things. They also offer a daily laundry service for children under 10 you can wash up to 10 items every day for £30 or so....such a good idea.    We are definitely to go back as it is perfect for relaxation even with the children.    The only minor areas of improvement are the wifi (so rubbish but it might be a problem with Morocco in general) and also we hired a nanny for the 10-day-stay for our baby through the concierge and she was mediocre. If you are to use this service (which is very expensive!) do ask for someone with strong references and who can really play with your baby and is enthusiastic. Ours was lame and all the sitters for other families were as lame as her. Such a shame if you compare them to the dedicated child-loving fun team of the kids club.    Also I would consider buffing up the concierge team at peak hours because she was overwhelmed by requests.  But those are minor things our overall stay was a total bliss and cant wait to return and so is the rest of the family.",Date of stay: December 2013,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/The_Smalls_in_London
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,axriyadi wrote a review Jan 2014,50,the (almost) perfect stay,The best hotel in Marrakech! Service was impeccable!    Day 1: Arrived late at Marrakech Menara Airport from Casablanca and our driver Said is waiting for us. We originally booked the cheapest car available (Mercedes E-Class) but was picked up by a very spacious and clean Mercedes Van. We arrived at the hotel was escorted to the lobby and sat down. While the receptionist checked us in we were served a traditional Moroccan mint tea. When the receptionist came back he told us that we have been upgraded from the Superior Room to the Pavillion Room with direct access to the pool. He then escorted us to the room with the buggy along with our luggage. He room was beyond expectation (wished the view could be better but since I've been upgraded who I am to complain?) it was spacious clean and luxurious. Love the outdoor area the extremely comfortable bed and huge toilet with deep soaking tub. Went to the Moroccan restaurant for dinner it was just okay. Overpriced food. Service was okay and a bit rude (waiters talked loudly and laughed while we were eating)    Day 2: Ordered breakfast and it was amazing. The various pastries are to die for! We went on the city tour with an English speaking guide for 55 euros which I think is way overpriced for the amount of information he gave us. He was only useful as he knows his way around the maze-like Souk. The hotel shuttle service between the hotel and the medina area was definitely a huge plus! We originally planned to have lunch at the poolside restaurant but since it was packed and the hostess was quite rude (we asked for a table of 2 and she just pointed elsewhere while she escorted another party behind us) so we decided to have lunch at the Italian restaurant instead. Again food was mediocre and overpriced but service was good (probably because the manager was there to keep an eye on things.) We order room service for dinner and it was just okay. Laundry service was good (valet picked up laundry at 10am and gave it back by 5pm the same day)    Day 3: We went to the Atlas mountains with Said (our driver who picked us up from the airport) and he was amazing (and cute!) We booked the Mercedes E-Class but was given the brand new Range Rover. We were very very satisfied! We had an amazing day and Said showed us all the good places to see and went beyond our expectations to satisfy us (we gave him a $60 tip cuz we love him!) We ordered room service and it was excellent. Furthermore when we got back to our room I realized that the headset I put on the table is gone so I called the reception to them check it out. Security came to take my statement but my headset is nowhere to be found.    Day 4: We checked out. We asked for the internet fee to be waived because we were having trouble with it (slow and keeps going on and off) - no problem. The manager came to apologize for the missing headset and told us that he would waive the transportation cost of around $70 to make up for it. Amazing customer service! Again we booked the E-Class but was given the Range Rover along with our favorite driver Said to take us to the Taj Palace.    The only thing I regret is that I didn't stay at the Four Seasons longer!  I wished I didn't move to the Taj Palace (I want to see where they filmed sex and the city!)

Everything seems to be extremely courteous and helpful. I bought some gifts from the market and went to the gift shop to ask for bags for me to carry on the plane. They offered to wrap these gifts for me! I was extremely impressed.  Overall this property is very high quality. It is very clean and quaint.  I think breakfast could be a lot better. The selection is rather limited and there is not much meat available if that is important to you. The sausages taste quite unusual.  The gym is well equipped but I am not sure why they constantly turn the AC off. The city is hot and the work out room is steaming hot but they just leave the doors open and keep the AC off. I asked the staff once and he closed all the doors and got someone to turn the AC system on. But I felt like it's such a big production for them so I just tolerated the heat at the gym for the remaining 4 days.  The spa is a must go!!

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Sarah H wrote a review Dec 2013,50,Faultless Service,We arrived late at night and once through the gates of the resort we were instantly transported into a magical candlelit oasis of calm. Check in was efficient and pleasantly relaxed over a cup of mint tea. The Deluxe Pavillion suite was rather spectacular with a cavernous lounge and spacious terrace with plunge pool. The breakfast was hearty and delicious with ample choice for even the most discerning of tastebuds. We tried the Italian which was ridiculously authentic (i lived in Italy for several years) and even equipped with a wood fired pizza oven! The Azzera grill served healthy fare and was also delicious. The complimentary evening car was a much appreciated service that we made good use of. The resort was impeccably maintained though the defining and exceptional feature of this Hotel is the staff. Without fail they were all professional and friendly always going the extra mile. The only suggestion i could make is that for wheelchair users the accessible room though well equipped with Japanese toilet and walk-in shower could have done with a few more handrails for support and a shower chair).All in all a wonderful stay.,Date of stay: December 2013,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sarah19London

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Scott A wrote a review Nov 2013,50,Beautiful property with expected 4 Seasons service,Another very positive experience with 4 Seasons resorts. The property is beautiful the rooms the same and the service was excellent. We dined one evening in the Moroccan restaurant and the food was excellent. Each morning we had the buffet breakfast and while a bit pricey was an outstanding array of quality food. The location while in the city is a little on the fringe. We were there on pleasure and so the Medina area was a natural destination. We did use the complimentary car service (6pm-11pm) once and that was fine. A service that ran during the day would have complimented the on-site experience. As it was we used taxis which also meant a haggle over the price each time.

Shirt transfer time from the airport speedy check in and shown to our room very quickly.    we stayed in a PAvillion room with direct access to the swimming pool. There were two single beds and ample room for a pull out sofa bed.    There was a huge flat screen tv with English channels although limited. Also there was a large choice of music you could play through the tv.    Massive bathroom with his and hers sinks separate bth and showe. The bath is probably the biggest I have ever seen in a hotel room...lovely and deep.    There was ample wardrobe space and a separate dressing room.    The grounds around the hotel are immaculately kept and all the staff are very pleasant always take the time ti say hello / good morning.    The resort its self is huge and we got lost on several occasions. Whenever we asked for directions to the bar or restaurants the staff would go out of the way to actually take you to your destination whilst telling you lots of information about the hotel. I have never encountered staff with such pride for where they work .    we stayed half board and the food was absolutely delicious. Breakfast there was ample choice of hot and cold options  and the orange juice is to die for the best I have ever tasted.. Our evening meals were most tasty cooked to a high standard.

The grounds are beautiful as ever. I had a Deluxe room with a very nice view of the Atlas mountains on a clear day. Breakfast was high quality and consistent but make sure you order the items that are not in the buffet spread (e.g. pancakes and waffles and the detox smoothie YUMMY). A special thanks goes to Felix the new GM of the hotel. His simplicity and attentiveness make him a real credit to the property. If I wanted to be really picky I just noticed that the small refreshments that are usually sent out to guests hanging out by the pool were not available this time but let's blame it on the weather. It was not pool season yet. Also the themed pop-up bar was very cool though it doesn't attract a lot of people. I will be back.

Very clean open fresh feel lovely splashes of rich colours and use of delightful fabrics.    Rooms very spacious offering everything you can require. All positioned very central to the main facilities the only downside in my opinion would be the terraces on the ground floor Pavilion rooms didn't offer much privacy as they are dotted along the pathways.    Lovely spa not badly priced either considering this is a top five star hotel book in advance as though very popular.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Tim P wrote a review Nov 2013,50,Best hotel I have ever stayed at. Period.,My wife and I stayed at the Four Seasons Marrakech for four nights and had the most amazing time. From the moment you enter the gate you know you are at a special place. Everything is perfectly manicured the staff are all look genuinely happy to see you and immediately you forget about any stresses from wherever you travelled from.    The rooms are spacious and very well appointed as nice as any 5 star hotel I have stayed at in the world. The facility is breathtaking and the lighting music colors and smells create an amazing ambiance.    The absolute best part is the staff. We arrived 40 minutes after booking and were immediately whisked away to the poolside restaurant to enjoy a complimentary lunch while our room was prepared. Everyone from the moment we arrived was very welcoming and never at once felt like they were after your wallet for anything. Every staff member has a smile they all look very nice and put together and they are always ready to share a laugh about something. You can tell that they want to be there and take pride in providing the best customer service in the world.    After staying at The Four Seasons Marrakech I cannot wait to stay at another Four Seasons property on our next trip.,Date of stay: November 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Honolulu, Hawaii",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/491timp

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,azad_mitri wrote a review Nov 2013,50,One of a kind,I stayed at the four seasons resort Marrakech for one night and it was one of a kind experience!  The beauty of the resort was so special the service extremely professional and the decoration fascinating!    The pool was large and very clean the special amenities provided there were very exclusive and the staff so friendly. Though more attention is required at the spa and gym.  The room was very spacious and marvelous with its private outdoor set and large bathroom and distinctive amenities.  The breakfast was great but one or two items were not very tasty as they should be (such as the labneh).  Although this is a resort but it was very well maintained concerning the cleanliness of the roads the transportation from the rooms to the main building or the restaurant.

Warm welcome on arrival we had interconnecting rooms for my husband and 10 yr old daughter and I. More than enough space. Very comfortable beds and lovely bed linens. Staff very friendly and helpful. Kids club worked well introducing our daughter to English speaking girls and therefore having great fun in the kids pool most of the day. Breakfast good lunch nice too by the pool or restaurant. All in all a lovely break. Hotel felt safe and small allowing my daughter to occasionally walk about hotel without an adult which felt very safe.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Amina25 wrote a review Oct 2013,30,Could have been great but unfortunately...,Before going to the Four seasons Marrakech with my husband we were really looking forward to it because every time we travel we go to a Four season if it's available in that city and have been satisfied since then. However when we first arrived and wanted to check in the front desk manager didn't believe we were married and did not want to check us in which is completely outrageous. People do not usually carry marriage certificate and we have never been asked to provide one. I can understand it's Morocco but we were in Sofitel Casablanca before and when they asked if we were married our answer was enough for them (because that is how you treat your customers). Not believing a customer is treating them as liars and this is completely unacceptable. We don't go to 5 stars hotels like The Four seasons to be treated that way it is not some cheap hotel that can afford to talk that way to customers especially loyal customers.  But after that everything was good we really loved the hotel and the staff was wonderful but this incident really got on our nerves and we couldn't enjoy it as we were expecting. Not to mention that after coming back to our room one night at 1 in the morning the shower wasn't working THE SHOWER and we had to wait for a guy for about an hour to fix it that is really something. But at least they were kind enough to remove that night from our bill (after we requested it of course).

Even though our lost luggage somewhat poisoned our arrival this was an amazing experience    Pros:  - Good location a bit farther away from the Medina than many other hotels but given the short distances and the smell in the inner city it is more a benefit. 10 mins on taxi to everywhere  - Outstanding service  - Great rooms ours had a small garden and terrace as well plus a super useful extra luggage room  - Amazing interior design breathtaking halls  - Three huge pools excellent swimming  - Grandiose outdoor design with wonderful palm trees  - our personal favourites: the stylish lamps in the staircases hung from above    Cons:  - despite having 5 restaurants the food is a bit boring few real local specialities - but of course very high quality  - bed is too soft    Alltogether an amazing resort perfect base to discover Marrakech in style.,Date of stay: September 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Canada,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DMikiG
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Jtung74 wrote a review Oct 2013,40,"Good resort, very relaxing",Choose to stay at the Four Seasons because of friends recommendation. I stayed two nights prior to four seasons at a riad in mid of the medina and thought a break at the four seasons would be relaxing.    Hotel facilities and location:  The hotel occupies a large estate which is out of town. To go to New City or Medina it costs 40-50 Dhs (don't get ripped off some taxi drivers asked for 100). However if you have seen Marrakech the hotel is large enough if you just want to chill out by the pool and dine and drink within the estate. There is hotel cars going to town between 6-10 pm (one way).    The resort is probably the largest in Marrakech. There are two pools (one adult only) which were quiet during my stay. There was also a shop a spa and a gym with tennis court. There are few restaurant including an Italian that occupied its own building an international (with Moroccan food) in the main building a pool side restaurant that open during the day and a bar. In terms of facilities I don't think there is any better resort in Marrakech.    Room:  I was allocated a deluxe room that was of good size and with a garden view. It has a very comfortable bed and well equipped bathroom. There is also a changing room which was handy. Wifi was available throughout the hotel for free unless if you require super high speed connection. There was a media hub and the entertainment provided on TV was good.    Service:  Service was unevent - started patchy but ended good  When I arrived by the car I was disappointed with the service. no one greeted us and I had to find the reception by myself. In the evening when I went to the restaurants and bars again I had to ask for assistance since no one was to be seen to help. Having said that the service at the spa was first class. Very friendly and very attentive (especially a lady in glasses) and service at the pool has been consistently great ( especially Rachid and the lifeguard). The second day experience improved significantly. The manager at the main restaurant during dinner shift was chatty and very friendly. All of his team recognise you and deliver great service. Next day breakfast we were served by Alt who was fantastic and again very friendly. The same level of service was seen at the bellboy desk especially Rachid    Food and drink:  We found food and drink pricy at the hotel but the quality of product was great. We had sandwich by the pool dinners and breakfast and food quality was top notch.    Overall it's a nice resort with good facilities. It's great if you just want to relax or host a conference.,Date of stay: October 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jtung74

The bathtub felt like a swimming pool :)  I would definitely go back to this hotel.  Advise: if you plan to stay at this hotel please make sure you have enough time to enjoy it.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,tripreviewerLondon wrote a review Oct 2013,50,Beautiful hotel 5 mins from the Medina,If you're looking for a resort hotel just outside the medina in Marrkech then I'd strongly recommend the Four Seasons. The hotel is set on a vast plot with beautifully manicured gardens. There are two swimming pools one which is adults only and is designed as a lap pool and one which is suitable for children with jacuzzis adjacent to each. Breakfast is a well stocked buffet. The rooms are large and well equipped with the signature Four Seasons beds (so comfortable!)  During off peak months only one of the two restaurants are open each night but the hotel will happily make dinner reservations for you in the new town or medina and arrange for a taxi to take you there.  The staff were absolutely excellent during our stay. I was unfortunately unwell with a stomach bug and they were so incredibly helpful arranging everything from doctors coming out to visit to fetching prescriptions from the pharmacy at all hours of the day. I cannot thank them enough for their help they made a fairly difficult few days very bearable. Thank you!

Everything about this hotel has quality stamped all over it. The level of service and attention with a friendly delivery from all employees throughout the hotel overlays a very attractive property that is pleasing on the eye and makes for a wonderful combination of business and pleasure. It seems to me the hotel constantly reviews how to please its guests and i was intrigued by the opening of a themed speakeasy bar to add variety. Apparently themes will change every month or so. I stayed in a Premium Room 320 which had everything you need plenty of space and a very nice balcony with chairs and lounges overlooking one of the pools.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,rko21 wrote a review Sep 2013,50,Paradise of tranquility,The Four Seasons Resort Marrakech is a paradise of tranquility and luxury amongst the hustle and bustle of beautiful Marrakech.    Staying only one night in August 2013 I was greeted by the very welcoming doorman who presented my family and I with cold towels and bottled water much needed after a warm taxi ride under the summer heat.    Then disaster struck. My fiancé had left her phone in a grand-taxi that dropped us off at the resort. After 5 minutes of panic and informing the aforementioned man who welcomed us he rang through to the security team who had tracked the taxi ordering the driver to return. Luckily enough the driver returned the phone after a few minutes thanks to the security team. You would not find this level of security anywhere else in Marrakech.    Check in was smooth. The two love-birds (you'll know what I mean if you have the luck to stay at the Four Seasons Marrakech) are beautifully chirping away as you are presented with mint tea nuts and dried fruit to snack on whilst check in is completed.    The rooms are all stunning with magnificent l'Occitane soaps shower gel shampoo and conditioners. I doubt there are better rooms in Marrakech. They are all modern and contemporary with a Arabesque feel which adds to the Moroccan experience. There are tea and coffee making facilities complimentary bottled water a large walk in wardrobe with a giant flat safe in a drawer. Playing around with the ceiling fans was amusing! Our interconnecting rooms both had a stunning terrace with a plush-pillow sofa to enjoy the views of the resort or Atlas mountains. Housekeeping staff are also attentive. Our housekeeping member addressed us personally and asked us if we would like anything else (more products water etc) as we waited on the terrace for him to clean our room during turn-down.    I was stunned by the level of detail at the hotel. They even offer at a charge a personal trainer to jog with you around the hotel to exercise and explore the grounds of the hotel. I'd have loved to have done this if I had more time.    The pool area (don't forget to try the jacuzzi as well) is like non I have ever seen. Pumps of sun cream is available where the towels are located and we were given small bottles of ice cold water by the pool staff as well as a delicious frozen fruit purée to cool us down.    I was however very disappointed by the slow check-out. I was charged for watching 2 movies on the entertainment system and this was NOT stated they are liable for a charge. That left a bitter taste.    However there is no better hotel or resort in Marrakech.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,NWSheffield wrote a review Sep 2013,40,Lovely hotel to escape and unwind,I stayed here for 4 nights with my husband for a short break without the children. We stayed in a deluxe pavilion room which was spacious with a lovely large balcony with table chairs loungers etc. In the room there was all mod cons you would expect IPOD docking station etc free wifi bathroom products were lovely and the room was well cleaned. Plastic stirrers instead of metal spoons for tea/coffee was below 5 star. We used the gym which was well equipped and the spa. We had treatments outside the hotel Hammam etc (see my other review) as the mark up in the spa we thought was ridiculous. Likewise we didnt get a transfer with the hotel it is only 2 miles from the airport and was 150 dirham in a taxi compared to 5 times that with the hotel for a 6 minute journey.  The hotel is about 10 minutes away from both the old and new town. We loved the old medina it is crazy and frenetic but great fun for a few hours to then return to the sanctuary of the four seasons.  We had room service breakfast very day for us there is nothing more decadent than having breakfast served on your own balcony!  We ate at the pool restaurant and the Moroccan and Italian both were okay ie 4/5 but not magnificent. We found the service great both in the restaurants and around the pool nice treats juices and sorbets whilst on your lounger. Compared to other 5 stars we found the prices reasonable the Moroccan white wine was surprisingly good and the prices certainly didn't make us flinch.  The hotel lays on a complimentary car in the evening to take you out which we used and thought it was a nice touch.  We would definitely recommend and would return with the children for a short break. I am a harsh critic so would defer giving it a 5 star as I think they could improve the food but if I was to return to Marrakech I wouldn't hesitate in booking this hotel I would look no further.,Date of stay: September 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Sheffield, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NWSheffield

The resort is quite large and is set off to great advantage amongst the beautiful gardens and water features. We had a pavilion room overlooking the adult only pool on the first floor and it was a good choice well equipped and of an excellent size it had a lovely large terrace with recliners and was very private.    We only used the complimentary shuttle on one occasion as it is a first come first serve basis so at busy times you will need a taxi if you have a table reserved in the Medina.    Breakfast was good but we had dinner the Solano restaurant which was distinctly average by comparison to the meals we had in the Riads of the Medina.    We are great fans of the Four Seasons brand and I would always mark the hotels at 5 stars and in some cases more however although the staff were very friendly this hotel has not got the personal touch that I would expect of the brand which is why I have marked it lower than I expected.,Date of stay: September 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Cheltenham, England",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/smith025

I have stayed at many other Four Season resorts and other 5* Deluxe hotels so my standards can be verging on the high side but I can honestly say I would return here without a second thought. The last time I was with Four Seasons outside of the UK was Sharm and although wonderful it did put me off the chain.    We opted for Pavilion Suite in Marrakesh which we’d highly recommend for anyone who wants to spend time around one of the 2 pools with the added benefit of extra living space (I saw the Premier Rooms and they were equally grand but on a smaller scale).    The service as always with Four Seasons is truly impeccable from housekeeping to the Spa. A special mention has to go to Andre Buldini who dealt with any small issues that we had with a level of professionalism that I admire.

The service both in and out of room is faultless. Housekeeping is perfect. By why oh why do we have to have intrusive rock music in all the public areas? There is nowhere outside of the spa where one can have a quiet time. By the way the staff at the spa are amazing! Go for hamman and the excellent massage from the inhouse team. Otherwise the weakness is with the food offering. Despite two restaurants open in the evening the menu was uninspiring. What is needed is a small bistro offering a variety of light meals. Sorry to be picky but this would convert a very good experience into an amazing one. Don't forget that there are two swimming pools one child free! Bliss! Some fellow guests felt that as they were advertised as heated they were too cold in which to swim. Try the sea!!

All the public areas were immaculate and all the staff were absolutely brilliant they couldnt have been more helpful or friendly.  At the poolside the large parasols keep the sun away and the pool side staff regularly ply you with complimentary water and fruit nibbles.  On slight raised eyebrow although to be fair this applies to most 5 star places the breakfast is extortionate so we took a £5 cab ride and stocked up with cereals juice and milk for the week for 3 of us price of one breakfast for one person for one day and enjoyed breakfast on our balcony instead :-)),Date of stay: July 2013,Trip type: Traveled with family,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Paulg390

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,ruby1971 wrote a review Sep 2013,50,FIRST CLASS SERVICE,Yes the hotel is beautiful but the real selling point for me was the service.  Staff really went out of their way to ensure you had a wonderful stay.  I had booked the basic room but was upgraded on arrival which I was very thankful for.  The room was very luxurious and had the legendary four seasons bed(super comfortable).  I am very much a fan of separate adult/family pools and I particularly appreciated the service around the adult pool. Regular treats served throughout the day.  Breakfast buffet spread was alright but ask for a la carte options-ps the French toast was delicious.  On a couple of occasions house keeping hadn't quite maintained the room properly but this was very quickly rectified as soon as I brought it to their attention.  I would like to mention how helpful the concierge was(sorry can't remember her name) she organised all my restaurant reservations and provided the hotel car most evenings.  I would not hesitate in recommending this hotel and very much look forward to returning.,Date of stay: August 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ruby1971

However areas to look out for;    Marks on bank notes will be rejected (ie pen marks stamps)    One day our room was not cleaned properly. Just say and they fixed the problem. So don't be shy in my opinion. However it was the girls room so very messy from the start lol.    Courtously Car broke down one day but no backup car which is odd when there is about 6 cars around? Might have been better to have a van that drops and picks up like other FS. However going in a top of the range 4x4 very nice (one way only).    Breakfast was ""ok"" but bread really hard to eat. You can ask for other things to be made ie chicken sussages as I dont eat beef. Full news papers are one day old and not always present (which is odd for FS) which is a shame as for me having a daily paper at the pool side is very relaxing.    Not much on TV channels (unless u wana pay). Mostly French and DVD collection average.    Exchange rate ok in hotel. You can get little more in madina but for me I just used hotel.    Could do with more evening entertainment for aduts but one day they did have a classical music player which was very nice    I did have some confusion about upfront money/deposit. The staff said they will take about £400 out of card but took £6k. I think it was a language barrier. Could job I have this available in my account lol. All returned on last day.    Weather can be hit and miss. We had two days of cloud but still warm and 5 days of baking heat.    Ps if you want big Mac food ask for one next to train station as it's closer and less busy. One day we just had takeaway in our room including pizza hut.

The hotel lived up to and in many areas exceeded our expectations. We had a Grand Pavilion Suite with adjoining Pavilion room which meant we were spoilt for space: the rooms were extremely well appointed and there was a private terrace with plunge pool. The hotel itself had several pools fitness centre and spa the latter being a favourite of all (Tarik to be mentioned here for his sports massage). As with all great hotels however it was the staff who made the hotel. They were all unfailing cheerful and solicitous. The concierge arranged numerous outings for us and we always felt that the hotel were looking to ensure our safety and our enjoyment. We had a super driver Mohammed Bouraki who suggested interesting visits. The Four Seasons is expensive but the enjoyment we had from the stay was worth it.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Gillian S wrote a review Aug 2013,50,Best family holiday so far!,The Four Seasons Marrakech is one of the best hotels that we have stayed at as a family. It is a true family resort that allows you to unwind and have a great family holiday without any stress at all.  The staff are amazingly friendly and the service is discreet and sincere. A special thanks to:  - Maryim who manages the Boutique. Maryim introduced us to Fenyadi which is an amazing design shop in the Industrial Quarter of Marrakech that sells Linens and Ceramics - well worth a visit  - Ali and his lovely wife who both work at the Hotel and have two young children and do very long hours. They were both friendly and very helpful especially when you have a picky 5 year old who doesn't eat well  - Mohammed who was the life guard at the family pool. Best of luck to him and his Law studies!  - The concierge who were very helpful in suggesting places to visit in the Atlas Mountains and organised a great picnic for us to take - thank you (-:  - The Spa was amazing as well. The first time I had ever had a hamam - you must try it when you are there  - The kids club was very accommodating.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Li Abd wrote a review Aug 2013,50,Four Seasons Marrakech,Four seasons is as usual a great hotel and especially so in Marrakech where people are warm friendly and hospitable. What I find excellent in this hotel was the hamam and massage. I am a massage freak. I love it and I am extremely particular with my masseuse. Mr Tarik my masseur was excellent! His acupuncture and pressure points combined with his special energy healing took me by surprised. His deep tissue pressure on the exact points were simply awesome. All I could think off during my session was 'it would me nice to have him massage my friends and I back in Malaysia' It's one of the best massages I had and I do come from a region that combines Thai Indonesian Malaysian Chinese and Indian Ayurvedic Master masseuses. Equally satisfied was my 12 year old daughter who had Ms Siham giving her a facial and a gentle relaxing massage. She loved it as Siham was so gentle and so child friendly! Thank you Tarik and Siham! And not forgetting Malikka who made sure that mum and daughter had a wonderful hamam scrubbed cleaned by two wonderful ladies! Breakfast in the hotel is ok not a fantastic spread like in most Asian countries but enough. Maybe they should include the cactus fruit that is served all over the streets of Marrakech? Never tried them but it seems very local. Kids club Ms Nabila and Ms Imane were a hit wit my children and not forgetting my son's happiness with his tennis companion Faouz and we had a great guide in Mr Mohamed Waseel!

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,iainm638 wrote a review Aug 2013,50,A Very Good Hotel,The first thing to say about going to The Four Seasons in Marrakech is NOT to buy Dirhams at Gatwick! I got less than 10 to 1 whereas even in the hotel I got almost 13.    That aside we spent 10 days at the hotel in July. The service and attention to detail were excellent. The welcome was good and the hotel has a real feeling of calm about it. We have 2 teenage girls and had a suite with connecting double room near the adult pool which worked really well. As is mentioned by others it is a bit expensive and the first bill I got made me do a double take - especially when I thought it was 10 to 1 and not 13 to 1. However I couldn't fault the quality or the service. There is a very good 'teenagers' club with lots to do and the 2 pools (1 adult and 1 family) are large and interesting. The service round the pool could at times be slow but in the main was excellent - especially Fouad. We spent 1 day touring the city and had an excellent guide called 'Feta - like the cheese!'. He was very happy to talk about the current political situation as well as giving you all of the history. The hotel was quiet when we were there - probably as the English schools had not yet broken up for the holidays - but as a result The Italian restaurant was only open on a couple of evenings and the roof top bar was closed completely during our stay. This made the eating option in the hotel fairly limited especially if you are staying more than a few days. However the restaurant recommendations from the hotel were excellent especially Maison Arabe and Riad Kniza. From the hotel to the medina by large taxi (more than 3 people) should be about DAM80 but they always ask for more - there are no meters. It's only 5-10 minutes away.    Anyway our overall rating for the hotel is excellent and I would recommend it to families and couples alike.,Date of stay: July 2013,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Belgrade, Serbia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iainm638

The rooms were immaculate the food was delicious and the amenities were fantastic. For those keen swimmers out there...its not often you come across a 44m outdoor swimming pool perfect to stretch out the limbs!    However what really made the trip was the wonderful service that we were given. We were made to feel so welcome and so at home as if nothing was too much to ask. Its definitely the little things that count...and the team at the Four Seasons Marrakech has realised that.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Georgia wrote a review Jul 2013,50,A wonderful Oasis away from the Madness,We stayed for three nights at the First Seasons. We were originally going to book a Riad in the Medina but I am so so pleased we stay at the Four Seasons. It is well placed to get to the main square (which is crazy at night!) less that a five minute drive and the Four Seasons provide complimentary transport into the main square at night.    We were met at the airport by one of the Four Seasons staff in a new Range Rover with some nice iced water which is a great way to start. Check in was one of the smoothest we have ever had sitting in the lounge with freshly brewed mint green tea and surrounded by the smell of 100s of beautiful roses isn't that how every check in should be!!    As it was our wedding anniversary the hotel very kindly upgraded up to a Pavilion room around the adult pool. The room was beautiful. Elegant good use of space and spotlessly clear. A Walk in closet which I do like and a great bathroom with a wonderfully deep bath. We had a our own large totally private terrace with beautiful flowers (all well kept) and we could access the pool via the gate from our terrace.    The breakfast was very nice not a hugh selection and some items cold but more than adequate. We weren't huge fans of the restaurants in the hotel and only ate in one evening we were excepting a little more fine dining in the Italian not just pizza and a few dishes so were disappointed with that. In contrast the restaurant at the adult pool we ate at every lunchtime and the food was excellent - it is a shame this restaurant is not open at night because we would have happily eaten here.    One thing I noticed at this hotel were the staff it seemed like they all knew the guests and would greet you by name which is very nice. The excellent pool/waiting staff around the beautiful Adult pool alway had a towel ready for us when we came out of the pool although the Family pool looked just at inviting. The fact the staff were so attentive and friendly whilst still being discrete really made this hotel standout for me.    Reception was extremely helpful and arranged dinner for us in a Riad which was an experience and just confirmed to us that having been to this beautiful Riad the Four Seasons really is the place to stay in Marrakech. I really can recommend this wonderful hotel with its beautiful pools and gardens not to mention the fantastic staff.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,CarolineGeorges wrote a review Jul 2013,50,A luxurious retreat at a stunning resort.,This five star resort property is the perfect place for a holiday! The hotel is understated in design but if you pay attention you'll see that the architects managed to cleverly incorporate beautiful Moroccan design and furniture throughout.    The flowers are beautiful and the hotel's gorgeous signature scent (made of roses and jasmine I believe) greets you in the lobby evoking a sense of place in this city which somehow manages to constantly engage every one of your senses!    The food was superb throughout the resort's restaurants and even the room service meals are very special. Breakfast is a banquet and so you should definitely leave a good deal of time to enjoy it.    We spent a lot of time at the spa. A hidden gem is the spa garden which harbors a refreshingly cold plunge pool which was a real oasis as the July weather was warm! The staff are so helpful and the Hammam treatment is a great ritual and it was well recommended that we had it at the start of our holiday before we went out and enjoyed the pool and the sun.    We loved the resort boutique which has a selection of the most beautiful local crafts holiday clothes antiques jewelry and gifts. The boutique staff went out of their way to source items that we had seen in a beautiful book on Moroccan Interiors which they sell in store.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Spiaggia wrote a review Jul 2013,20,"Beautiful hotel, so why the bad review?",My husband and I love the Four Season hotels and have stayed in many around the world hence the booking at Four Seasons Marrakesh.    There were lots of good things it is a beautiful hotel the staff are kind and helpful especially at the pool area. The food is excellent albeit expensive but that is to be expected at the Four Seasons so was not a problem. The breakfast was delicious and the waiting staff in the morning were superb however children are not supervised well in the breakfast area and this is small problem.    So what was SO wrong that I give it a ''poor'' review?    Well we chose this hotel outside of Marrakesh so that we could have peace and quiet and have lazy mornings. We were given a room on the 2nd floor and every morning the cleaner would move the furniture in the room above. The floors are marble and the noise at 0825 am would be so loud that it would waken us. If it was not the cleaners then the occupants above would move a chair and it was heard clearly in our room. Noise pollution should not be a problem at this level of hotel. We did not get a long lie once. Just what we did not want as we came tired and needing a break. We work so hard during the year that this is our once a year holiday with no children.    The hotel offered us one spa treatment to make up for it. Not really a solution. Kind offer but not a solution.    They denied the cleaners were in the rooms but a trip upstairs by my wife to have a look (seeing as we were up anyway) showed that the room was being cleaned.The trolley with cleaning products (which clatters along the bedroom floor as well) and the vacuum cleaner (on wheels!!!!!!) were outside the bedroom door in the room above which proved that it was the cleaners. Sad that a hotel of this standard and reputation denied this.    What should they have done?    Well I had hoped to be moved to a top floor so that there was no sound from above. This did not happen.Most likely as that would have been a substantial upgrade. I was not looking for a free upgrade just a good night's sleep and lie in after 9am to be honest.    I would not therefore recommend this hotel unless you are up and out at 8am for sightseeing and stay for only a few days.    We were here for 7 days for a complete relaxing holiday with alternative days of sightseeing in between. It doesn't work unless you pay for a third floor room. The room on the 2nd floor we were in was lovely but ruined by the noise from above.    On our departure we left a letter of complaint yet but nothing has yet come back. So much more should have been done to fix it.    Really special waiting staff and pool staff but the management of this hotel is lacking. They have a lot to learn from genuine complaints from genuine people.

When you enter the resort you smell beautiful flowers and are greeted with mint tea and Moroccan sweets. We had Room 217 overlooking the fountains with a covered sitting area. The staff were very accommodating and nothing was ever too much trouble. They are the nicest people. The food was delicious with the risotto cooked to perfection. The grounds are stunning and full of tropical flowers and singing birds. The bed was so comfortable we woke up thinking we were at home. We did not want to leave.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Joanne G wrote a review Jun 2013,50,Luxury at it's Finest!,We took a group tour of Morocco ending in Marrakech staying at the Four Seasons. Our room was a suite as part of a residence. It could not be any more luxurious. The all marble bath had double sinks and a fancy shower etc. and all amenities for a king and queen. There was also a walk in closet. The bed was so comfortable and we had a terrace that was almost completely private. We ordered room service and it was so professional and decadent. The breakfast buffet was wonderful and guests could also lounge in the spa area. The service was phenomenal and the staff friendly.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Suzanne M wrote a review Jun 2013,50,Best Hotel in Morocco,We spent 5 days at this beautiful hotel and I can't recommend it highly enough. The rooms are stunning the grounds of the hotel are the nicest I have ever seen - its so lovely to wake up to the sounds of birds singing in the morning.  Its a great place to have children particularly fussy eaters as the kids menu is available in all the restaurants at the hotel so parents do not have to be confined to Italian restaurants. There's a great Moroccan restaurant worth trying too.  The staff at this hotel were so incredibly accommodating that we felt very special. Nothing was too much trouble. There are 2 great pools - one adults only and the other for children - but to be honest there was never a time that the kids pool seemed overrun with children.  If you are looking for a relaxing and luxurious experience in Marrakech you really need look no further.

Spotlessly clean and everything and a bed to die for everything you would have expected of a 5star hotel. My balcony overlooked one of the resort pools and beautiful gardens. Breakfast was once again 5 star All in all a fantastic few days it would be very easy to stay here for a week not appreciating the real Morocco which would be a shame.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,bonzo123 wrote a review May 2013,50,beautiful resort,me and hubby visited four seasons  and we were hugely impressed. The resort is beautiful with the décor so warming and inviting and typically moroccon. The service is outstanding  the food delicious however the drinks are largely overpriced. The hotel is so tranquil and the hotel pays minute attention to detail eg the smells in reception on arrival. the décor and courtesy shown to us on arrival. The green tea with mint and the gentleman who serves it is exceptional in reception. The lifeguards are also so friendly and courteous. The room was outstanding. The hotel was outstanding and we would certainly visit again We visited three restaurants two being in the new town  and one in the medina. The hotel staff were so helpful in arranging transport for us and we were grateful. One thing to be aware of however On one occasion however we ordered a taxi to the medina to a restaurant via the hotel staff The taxi driver took us and on arrival we were immediately met by a young boy who we automatically thought was from the restaurant. He however led us to the restaurant and then a few metres down alleyways to the square in the medina and then demanded huge amounts' of money off us. On reflection we realised that the taxi driver had phoned somebody during the transfer and stated we were from the four seasons and now we realise that we had been set up so this boy would meet us by the taxi driver. This was very upsetting and although not the hotels fault we completely trusted that we were safe in the taxi that had booked for us by the four seasons. A great advantage was also free use of the internet which was as bonus. Breakfast was delicious but pricey hotel overall though was magnificent .Thanks for a great stay,Date of stay: May 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Merthyr Tydfil, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bonzo123

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,DavidCarolKt wrote a review May 2013,50,A very special place to stay,My wife and three of our children (21 19 and 18) stayed here for 6 days at the end of March 2013. We choose the hotel because we had a successful stay at a Four Seasons Hotel in the UK last year and we wanted to visit a warm country and not to travel too far.  Arriving at the hotel was wonderful and we felt immediately that we had done the right thing. The atmosphere was very special. The service was excellent as one would expect from a 5 star hotel.  The rooms were lovely and we were able to relax and forget our cares for a little time.  The hotel has two pools with one for adults only and therefore quieter for just swimming. The fitness facilities were good as were the restaurants. We chose a different restaurant each night as well as travelling into Marrakech (2 miles) on a couple of occasions to eat. Breakfast was lovely.  The hotel is clear that it seeks to cater well for children and it does (even big ones!).  The staff were never-endingly friendly and helpful. Nothing was too much trouble. Worth a special mention was the pool manager/lifeguard and the manager of the outdoor restaurant.  It was very expensive for five of us to stay there and we couldn't afford to do it more than once a year but I am increasingly coming to the conclusion that it is worth choosing such a hotel/chain for the certainty it offers for the holiday we want.,Date of stay: March 2013,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Hereford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavidCarolKt
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,VSF F wrote a review May 2013,50,Book now.,We arrived at the Four Seasons at 10pm to the most beautiful reception. it was lit beautifully by candlelight and it smelt incredible. it was the perfect arrival ( one of the best). THe hotel is only 10mins from the airport but you would never have guessed. You see virtually no airplanes and it is beautifully tranquil. The grounds are well kept and the pools are of superb quality (you cat even tell tehy have chlorine in them!). the room was very neat and perfectly clean with a very high quality of bed linen. The room i had had an adjacent patio with loungers which was great.  The staff at this hotel are amongst the friendliest kindest and helpful hotel workers i have come across. They worked tirelessly to meet your every desire and at no point were ever intrusive or overbearing They were utterly attentive and extremely helpful.  We took a few trips to the medina- which was something i shall never forget and despite being a blonde female i did not feel harassed. The atlas mountains were incredible and i most definitely would recommend that anyone should take a trip there whilst in morocco.  All you need to do is ask at reception and the trip will be booked  We had one sour incident involving being ripped off by a taxi driver. Instead of being charged 70Dr we were charged 400Dr. `after realising we spoke to the hotel which deducted this from our overall bill. service.  I cannot recommend this hotel enough.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Kitty L wrote a review May 2013,40,Lovely hotel,I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the FS Marrakech. Beautiful hotel luxurious interior and rooms and a stunning garden. I would have given this hotel a higher rating had it not been the rather hit and miss service from the restaurants and room service. Room service arrived with only one meal (we had ordered two meals) trying to tell us it was our mistake although they could not explain why they had sent two bread baskets and two table settings if they only thought one person was dining. They eventually conceded and brought the second meal. Not really a good enough standard for £22 per steak.  Similar problems in the restaurants though the staff always made an effort to put things right and this was done in a good natured way. Food overall was excellent though pricy given the less than slick service.  The adult pool is well managed by Yassine who is an absolute star working tirelessly ensuring everyone has their sun beds and parasols adjusted. Pretty good drinks service around the pool although my lunch order was delivered to neighbouring guests who ate it without question! It took a a while to sort out another order but it did eventfully arrive an hour later.  This will be a fabulous hotel when these little faults are sorted out. I will be happy to return as I found all the staff very cheery and pleasant.,Date of stay: May 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Leamington Spa, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Milouxxx

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,byrneUK wrote a review May 2013,40,Teenagers happy,A week with our two teenagers for the end of May half term - they both enjoyed it and even better so did we.    We took 2 interconnecting deluxe rooms 37 and 38 (510 Euros per room/night). Both rooms shared a common front door ie a hallway linked the 2: ideal for us. These rooms were a fair way from reception (down on the RHS of the property) but ideal for us and not all noisy. One of the rooms had an exceptionally large balcony and both were well as luxurious as you would hope in a FS resort.    Highlights for us:    - the FS airport arrivals service and then limo is worth having  - Solano breakfasts good  - pool side restaurant (Azzera?) Mediterranean style and good food although could be slow if you arrived at peak time  - we liked the Zest roof top bar and the courtyard dining outside  - hired bikes and cycled into and through the medina  - good childrens club: our younger teen was 14 and liked it  - the gardens and grounds and in fact the walled nature of the property (bit like Mamounia) was good for us    We were not so keen on:  - Solano for dinner  - we also ate in the Inara courtyard upstairs (light meal) - essentially there was not enough choice in terms of nighttime dining. This may have been because it was May but I am unsure  - taxi or car service into the medina seemed a bit patchy ie not instant by any means,Date of stay: June 2012,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/byrneUK

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,mez_mama wrote a review Apr 2013,40,Great if you have kids,I always thought I would stay in a riad when I finally visited Marrakech but with two kids under the age of 4 we decided that the Four Seasons would provide the space and privacy we needed.    The hotel is superb; nice interiors; good service; lovely pools. But the best thing this hotel offers is the kids club and we took advantage if this facility everyday. The kids loved it! The girls working there are really fantastic and my kids still talk ask about them from time to time!    The only thing stopping this hotel being the best place I have stayed in is value for money and the food. It's not that the food is bad it's just not particularly good.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Marchmain wrote a review Apr 2013,40,Sadly lacks some of the glamour of nearby Grande Dame.........,But what FSM resort lacks in authenticity ( unfair to compare to a property built in 1923! ) it more than makes up for in the hospitality stakes. The pools are beautiful and spacious and if you happen to be a family then FSM beats the competition hands down! The scheduled activities and the genuine care the staff showed their charges was nothing short of superb. The bedrooms and suites are spacious and I recommend the ground level pavilion rooms as the patios are large and provide additional space to retire too! Service around the pool could be improved upon as they are often busy serving lunch and I did have to rely on the life guard to help me move sun loungers etc The food is generally good and the pop up bar is an excellent idea. whilst I was there they hosted a design evening and the top floor open air bar came alive with an influx of the beautiful and the vibrant! FSM is a beautifully designed resort but if it's people watching and vitality you require then you may leave disappointed however if like myself you enjoy good service spacious accommodation and pool side privacy then FSM will suit you just fine - for a people watching dressing to thrill fix then take a cab for a glass of fizz to the grande dame in the full and reassuring knowledge that the comfort and care of FSM awaits you.,Date of stay: April 2013,,"Radlett, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marchmain

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,RallyMonkey wrote a review Apr 2013,40,Relaxing Resort,This is a relatively new Four Seasons and if you know the brand you can rest assured that this resort now offers service which is now very close to other FS resorts world wide; in an ideal location.    The setting and the architecture are outstanding the resort is small and has a perfect air of calm similar to the FS in Chang Mai for instance. On the other hand there are fewer activities than some of the busier resorts such as Punta Mita and Costa Rica. in fact there were no additional activities during our stay. That suited us but may be not everyone.    Breakfast and food are excellent but only cater to western tastes.    The adult pool was quiet and finding shaded chairs was never a problem. Unusually for FS there is no pool service though staff from the nearby restaurant will bring drinks if you go and find them.    The staff are responsive and quickly put right anything that was wrong. Guest should not hesitate to ask to speak to a manager if there is a problem my experience throughout the FS group is that they will try to respond to any (reasonable) request.    The Concierge service was helpful and friendly. They have a good (you may even say definitive) list of local restaurants.    The one area of caution is with regard to the (outsourced ?) transportation. We booked a trip in to the Atlas Mountains the driver (....a butcher who got the job through his cousin) did not follow the itinerary given by the concierge and also took a few wrong turnings. He seemed intend on taking us to some destinations that we had not requested and to be wasting time so we would not get back to the hotel before 5pm. The air-conditioning in the car did not work. If we were to return we would consider using a local guide and transport rather than the Four Seasons facility unless changes had been made.    Overall this is an excellent resort I recommend it and would return.,Date of stay: April 2013,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Rossendale, UK",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RallyMonkey

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,HassanBen wrote a review Apr 2013,50,Style and substance in Marrakech,After having stayed at FS Marrakech in June 2012 and having encountered some teething problems I was very much satisfied with my second stay there. The resort is now up and running and staff have learnt the lesson the level of service is now to par with other FS hotels and resorts around the world. What I noticed was the management added some moroccan touches to the resort which was a great addition and created a very nice setting. Private Room pop up lounge was exquisitely decorated and cocktails were okay however it's sad to see there was nobody there on a Friday evening. The staff were great very helpful and all smiles from doormen to pool attendants. I did some shopping at the resort's boutique which had some great finds I just couldn't resist buying the hotel's signature scent that you can smell in the lobby blissful. The bed was heavenly and the bathroom great as well however some flower arrangements in the room would've been appreciated. That's what you would expect at 500+ EUR a night. Room service was outstanding (great cheeseburgers) and Azerra Restaurant by the pool served okay food if what you need is a snack in between tanning sessions. The adults pool is exquisite and quiet which is a great bonus. I found the breakfast spread to be rather poor especially after having experienced breakfast spreads in top hotels in Asia. However you can order any item you like just make sure you do that. Upon checkout unfortunately I had a very poor experience with one of the staff (Abderrahim). If you refer to my previous review of June 2012 it was the same staff that delivered a disappointing level of service. Due to a miscommunication as to a double occupation of the room (instead of 1 adult) I was told there would be an extra charge for the second adult however no mention of this was done upon checking in so I didn't expect this. And Abderrahim couldn't care less just stared and told me that payment for the room was already made so we had to pay the additional charge. This was unprofessional and I should've been notified right from the beginning. Proactiveness is a must especially in the hotel industry. A little while after though I had a much better checkout experience with Ilyas who was very courteous and dealt with the minor situation in a very professional and polite way. I hope that in my next visit check-in and check-out will be completely seamless and fast with no hidden charges or problems. And I insist that reception staff especially the one I mentioned need extensive training as to how to treat hotel guests and how to present minor issues in a favourable way to avoid customer dissatisfaction. There's a lot of competition in Marrakech and I wouldn't hesitate to book Mandarin Oriental when it opens so the management needs to deal with this especially since my last review went unanswered by the GM. Otherwise this is a great property and it was a real pleasure staying here once again. Definitely recommend it if you want a sophisticated yet very relaxing stay in Marrakech.,Date of stay: April 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Casablanca, Morocco",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HassanBen

The Four Seasons sits around 5 minutes drive from the airport and 10 minutes from the Medina. A perfect location if you are looking for a split of 70% poolside and 30% culture.    The rooms are great but like every hotel they have the really irritating habit of putting you in a low grade one first - in our case a "" view of the kids pool"" at our stage in life a view of the airport would be more welcome anyway we were moved to room 88 and happy.    The staff is great and work with tremendous enthusiasm although in the case of the hotels Italian this manifests itself into the constant looking at order slips - missed courses and wrong orders - that said order the pizza excellent.    The Souk is worth a visit but beware of the guides favourite ""vendors"" ie his pals who incentivise him before you know you where you are you're locked in some shop only to escape if you are cluthing a bag of smelly herps or a fez that will at best fit into the "" good idea at the time"" catagory.    The Medina at night is overated but worth a look.    Outside the restaursnts are ok the best being the Comptoir which has belly dancing at 1030 ( although only for 15 minutes)    The rest serve the quality of food you wouldn't pay half the price for in London normally in virtual darkness.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,AS-reviewer wrote a review Mar 2013,30,Mixed experience,Not really knowing what a riad would be like or which one to chose we decided to play it safe and stayed at the Four Seasons in Marrakech. In retrospect this was a bad choice. The Four Seasons is about a 5-10 minute drive into the old town. In reality this is not a big problem and the hotel offers a courtesy car (albeit not always available) and a taxi only costs drms 50. However it does mean that you are less likely to make short trips into and out of town.    A friend of ours works at the Four Seasons in London and let them know we were arriving. Apart from mentioning this in our welcome note this made no difference to our stay (which we really can't complain about). We booked a pavilion room as we wanted to overlook the pool and had read that these were the nicer rooms. We wish we had known to ask for a west facing room as by the time we had returned from breakfast our terrace was in shade.    We ate in Solano on our first night as we wanted to experience traditional Morrocan food without needing to go into town. There were only about two other tables occupied so it felt rather soulless. The food was ok but nothing to write home about. The tagine was not served with Morrocan bread but with rice which seemed odd. At £25 for a glass of champagne it felt less Morrocan all of a sudden! The breakfast in this restaurant is good with a plenty of choice.    Our room was perfectly pleasant but unfortunately managed to get a negative score with one of my 'no nos' for 5 star hotels - a hairdryer which requires you to keep your finger pressed on it or it goes off and no cold shot button! The internet connection was not strong and you sometimes had to move around the room to catch it.    The spa is one of the best things about the hotel. I had a lovely massage during which I drifted off several times! I came away feeling thoroughly relaxed.    The pool attendants were really welcoming and helpful and the pool area is lovely and clean and well designed. The gym was good with plenty of machines.    If we went back to Marrakech we would not choose this hotel as we found a riad that we loved and felt more authentic.,Date of stay: March 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AS-reviewer

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,trvljournalist wrote a review Mar 2013,40,pleasant but dissapointing,I am a big fan of the Four Season's brand so perhaps the bar was set too high when we arrived. I was there for a small conference and sadly the hotel felt more of a ubiquitous conference center than a luxury resort in exotic Marrakech. In fact the design of the hotel didn't resemble the location at all looking more as it would be at home in Arizona than reflective of the romance and culture of Morocco. The service too was certainly pleasant and attentive but here again it felt corporately congenial. We had been promised an upgrade upon arrival and at check in no one said a word and diligently put us in a regular room while they worked their way through the check in line. The room was adequate but if you are going to raise a customer's hopes of an upgrade you put a bad taste in their mouths from the outset if you don't honor it especially in a half filled hotel. I said something to the manager at check out and I got the pleasant smile saying one wasn't available - which was interesting considering the 50% occupancy and the fact others in my conference were upgraded. A measure of care in reading our record prior to quickly processing us in a room would have alleviated this.  The grounds were well manicured and the room was clean and efficiently designed. I will say that much of the common spaces seemed empty or incomplete as if they had run out of money furnishing this huge property.  Meals were fine but the tiny bar and it's one bartender was easily overwhelmed by our group when we descended upon it for after dinner drinks and conversation. This lead to long waits for drinks.  After touring some of the charming other hotels in the city we came away from this experience as we had missed an opportunity to experience the flavor of the city and its many charms and history by staying in an overly corporate and westernized property. It's not like the Four Season's to miss this badly and I fear this hotel was designed in a board room in Canada instead of capturing the local spirit of Marrakech.  If you are a timid soul and feel more at home in the west but just want to sneak out for a taste of the Medina and then retreat back to the comfort and familiarity of a westernized hotel this place is for you. If you want to feel the full experience of being in Morocco then maybe not.,Date of stay: April 2012,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Baltimore, Maryland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trvljournalist

The service was the best I have ever experienced the food was wonderful - exotic Morrocan with an European touch.    Spend a couple of afternoons by the pool and the service was absolute the best. The life guards and the waiters at the cafe were very attentive and kind. Brought clean and dry towels when we needed them (and even when we didn't need them) provided us with sun lotion moved the parasols etc. - still without being overattentive.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,globaltraveler000 wrote a review Feb 2013,50,Stunning design and excellent service,My husband and I stayed at the FS Marrakech in September for 5 nights and had nothing short of an excellent stay. The hotel is beautiful. I was nervous because many reviews said that it was lacking in local design but I think it had the perfect touches of local flair. It was subtle but we tend to lean towards modern anyways. The architecture and landscaping was beautiful. The spa was also worth visiting. We stayed in a Pavilion Room and it was wonderful. They are in the free standing casitas if you will overlooking the resort. Next time I would try the Pavilion suite which was below our room but had a plunge pool. The service was phenomenal from the pool person to the individual in charge of creating experiences. She helped me plan an unforgettable afternoon for my husband's birthday. I would definitely recommend the hotel to couples singles looking for some R&R and families. In fact the family pool was possibly more stunning than the adult pool! Worth the trekk to Marrakech.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Andreainessex wrote a review Feb 2013,50,Exceptional service in wonderful surroundings,My husband and I stayed here for a few days at the end of January. The weather was warmer than expected so we lazed by the pool most days. Some days we had the place to ourselves. It was very quiet which for us was perfect. The staff were so helpful. They tended to our every need. Nothing was too much trouble. Everything about this hotel is perfect not just the staff but the breakfast the cleanliness the spacious room the lounge and bar..... The hotel provides a courtesy car (v nice range rover with tinted windows and leather interior) to take you to any restaurant in the evening. The only drawback is getting ripped off by taxi drivers in unroadworthy cars with no lights on the way back!  We stayed in a standard room which had a huge bed balcony tea and coffee making facilities (expensive) mini bar walk in wardrobe decent sized safe big tv with English channels (so you can remind yourself how cold and wet it is at home!). The bathroom had a big walk in shower and huge sunken bath (big enough for 2). It also had a hilarious space age toilet which had all sorts of options..... The toiletries are l'occitane. The rooms were cleaned twice a day with fresh towels clothes folded bottled water replenished slippers laid out etc.  The hotel is a 10 min drive from the airport. You see the occasional plane but it's barely noticeable.  I would highly recommend this hotel. The staff are best i have ever encountered. The only downside is it being a 15 min drive into town and having the feeling of taking your life in your hands with the taxi ride back. If the hotel had 3 or 4 restaurants you could stay put and it wouldn't be an issue.,Date of stay: January 2013,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Andreainessex
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,BrownOwlLondon wrote a review Jan 2013,30,Death by a thousand cuts,"I've been debating for a few months about writing this review because we did like the resort: we had a lovely suite the food was good the spa was heavenly and it was a lovely setting BUT the service in general was just not up to scratch. Each of the things that went wrong was a small annoyance but not one aspect of our stay from check-in to departure went smoothly which marred the trip.    There were lots of very friendly staff and a few who really seemed to get it but there was a general lack of coordination and staff empowerment. For example it is all great to have a guy in a suit greet you when you arrive but we really wanted one of those hot/cool towels (I don't know which it was as we never got one) to wipe the travel dust off and one of those cool drinks we saw being carried on a tray (while we were waiting and without having to hunt down someone to ask). I'm not going to list everything but there were two instances that were particularly disappointing:    It made our blood boil that the pool staff reserved the best spots by the family pool for VIPs. Definitely not cool. There were at least 10 loungers at the pool edge empty and we refused to be relegated to a spot farther away. It was definitely not the case that someone had taken a brief absence as one of the sets of chairs was still empty when we left and we got to see how a target family was treated when they arrived.    We were also unhappy with the guide that the hotel arranged again perfectly nice but lacking in cultural awareness - we were put off by comments like ""Berbers are tall and handsome like me Arabs are short and fat with big noses"" and jokes about polygamy and enjoying shocking European women by telling them that the flag pole on the minaret tower is used to hang disobedient wives. I'm sure someone else would have found him charming and perhaps we don't have the same sense of humour but this experience was not up to the standard of tour guides we've booked through FS before.    Breakfast staff were particularly lovely the spa therapist who gave me the hamman experience was fantastic and our housekeeper was also very accommodating (once we realised no one had passed on our preferences and she and I spoke directly).    So why did I debate writing this review? Because it was a nice place to visit probably even more so if you have small children and Marrakech is a great location for a short trip in the sun from Europe. But if they want to make it as good as other FS resorts they still have work to do on the service front.",Date of stay: October 2012,Trip type: Traveled with family,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrownOwlLondon

The hotel is beautifully presented and the surrounding grounds are just perfect. Our room and en suite shower and bathroom were contemporary luxury of the highest standard but with an elegant Moroccan twist. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff who were friendly and courteous but also very helpful with advice on the best places to visit during our stay. Every day fresh fruit and tiny morsels of Moroccan delicacies were left in our room for us to sample and every evening a member of staff drove us into Marrakech to try out yet another restaurant they had said we should try before we left.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Jens1974 wrote a review Dec 2012,20,Not Worthy the Four Seasons Brand,Not sure how this property got all the good reviews. Currently staying here and more than disappointed. Have been fortunate enough to experience other Four Seasons and this one is clearly not up to the standard.    @Check-in: They emailed me in advance asking for the guests name (good). Only then to address everybody by my name (really bad). So why bother asking me at all? Furthermore check-in was unnecessary long.    @Room: Got room with no view on ground floor (which they call deluxe not lowest category) despite promises to the contrary before. Reception told me I got worst room because only pay special rate (which is correct but still 400 Euro per night). So unless you pay top rate you are treated as second class citizen.    In addition room was not properly cleaned. Windows at least not cleaned for two weeks. If you position yourself as 5+ star property and currently charge up to 700 Euro/ night for standard room you might consider cleaning the windows more often. Room also misses a desk to work which I find surprising. Plus e.g. fittings in bathroom or furniture not of highest quality (more like 4 star hotel and not comparable to FS Park Lane in London).    Even worse my friends were put in room with connecting door and NO noise isolation. They can hear everything what is said and done in room next to theirs. Talking to reception did not even get a feedback. Manager has now acknowledged the problem (we are aware) but can´t help (as hotel booked). My advice: Tell people when they book and they can then make a decision if they want to come despite that.    @Service level: They are trying but for a hotel now open since 1.5 years they should have figured it out by now. Apparently breakfast room too small for a full hotel (don´t ask). Instead of a) opening other restaurant for breakfast b) offering in room breakfast for free or c) offering breakfast until 12 instead of 10:30am hotel has decided to use banquet chairs and tables in addition. Never mind that whole atmosphere of place is being destroyed by non fitting furniture.    @Resort: Definetely not five stars. Gym & sauna (both too small for hotel this size) not connected to main building. So guests have to walk there with coat (currently cold at night and in the mornings). Same story for spa. Tennis courts are clay - which is great in case you make sure everybody plays with proper shoes. That is not the case. Btw: Gym machines are not disinfected after usage. Sauna is not heated.    Overall this is at best a four star property (when compared to places like Dubai Maldives Austria etc.). Certainly not up to usual Four Seasons standards.,Date of stay: December 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Dusseldorf, Germany",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jens1974

There is a out door pool with cabanas around the side which is really good for getting changed and relaxing out of the sun in poolside there is a bar as well. Breakfast selection was good however be warned if you ask for a fried egg it takes ages for the chief to cook :-) also they had a standard domestic toaster for the toast..not good as there was always a queue for the toast.  The reason I have rated this hotel not as high as I am sure some people think it should be is because of the multiple ''little'' things that just add up..which for a 5 star hotel is just not on... I had to ask for turn down on a number of occasions dental and shaving kits had to be delivered to me there was a mat on the floor next to the toilet (uggghhh) totally unhygienic ! toilet light switch finger plate was loose and unkemptshower slider would not stay up in the shower cubicle and to cap it all there was a spill outside of my room that wasn't cleaned up in the days that I stayed there. Now I appreciated that all the points that I have mentioned may seem small but when you are paying in excess of €500 for a room I expect a certain level of facility's and service.

We were lucky to be upgraded to a very nice suite with lots of room. A few minor things in the room did not work (a plug the scale one of the shower jets--the computer driven shower took a couple of minutes to figure out...but really cool after we got it going) but was clean and comfortable. We really liked the patio. A few things in the hotel need work we got stuck in an elevator for 10 minutes and the emergency phone didn't work...we had to call the front desk on our mobile--we were told they are aware of the problem put having trouble getting parts.    The staff in the kid zone were awesome (5+stars to the staff here and possibly the most friendly resort staff I have ever met) and the facility very nice. They don't allow children under 4 to stay without supervision but they do a great job playing with the kids.    The service quality was generally very good and clearly the staff were working very hard to make the stay pleasant and were very friendly to children.    One of the pools was heated and both pools were amazing.    What made the stay unusual was that 95% of the hotel was taken over by Land Rover and they were brining a new team of car salesmen every 24 hours or so. Most of the hotel was very quiet except breafast when you shared the resturant with this large (not very friendly) group. As a consequence most of the resturants in the hotel were closed and there was limited food choice in the hotel. The Land Rover group is going to be there for a significant time (perhaps a month) and I would skip the hotel when they are there. Other than choice the food was good.    I would stay at the hotel again but would check to see if they had any large groups staying and to figure out what facilities might be closed. If we return to Marrakech I would be tempted to try one of the other five star hotels--put the quality of the staff in the kid zone would likely bring me back to the four seasons.,Date of stay: November 2012,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Paris, France",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Crazyteamtravel

The pool was almost empty a bit too quiet for my taste maybe because the water was very cold (they told me they heat the pool only during winter time). We had breakfast every day one lunch and room service a couple of times. Food was mostly good but sometimes just OK. Service not always up to FS standard and far from the service levels we experienced at Amanjena where we stayed afterwards.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,TrophyCollector wrote a review Oct 2012,50,Maybe my new Nr. 1 - beating La Mamounia,La Mamounia was one of my favourite hotels worldwide for many years - it still is - but maybe the Four Seasons is my new local Nr. 1. I hate to say that because usually I don't like the Four Seasons Hotels due to their bland standaridzation that often fails to connect with the local atmosphere (this is also the problem of the Amanjena). Here the 4S does indeed manage to incorporate the magic of Marrakech. Great public areas with palms and ponds and a fantastic pool. The La Mamounia pool for example cannot compete anymore and needs an upgrade (even if the interior design renovation by Jacques Garcia good). The one point where the La Mamounia certainly stays ahead of the 4S is the location inside the Medina and walking distance to the Djema el Fnaa and some of the better restaurants (Jad Mahal Comptoir Skybar ...). The 4S requires a taxi to get to town but is still much much closer than for example the Amanjena L Mansion or the Palais Namaskar. Rooms and service are of the famous and solid 4S quality which is a plus in a country where tourist trapping language gap mixed service and bad food still happen.,Date of stay: October 2012,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Monaco-Ville, Monaco",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TrophyCollector

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Asta72 wrote a review Oct 2012,50,"Wonderful stay at this well managed, charming and beautiful resort","Rating:  I have no qualms about giving this property a shining 5!  It is very well taken care of in every way staff will go out of their way to ensure that you´ll have a perfect stay and everything you want/need food is great and arrive duly on time the pools are large and beautiful and the rooms are very comfortable and spacious.    Before making our reservation with the FS we were wondering if we would like to go to a property that´s not on the ocean but we were pleasantly surprised how content we felt strolling around the grounds. It also helps that the resort grounds are so charming well manicured and filled with herbs and fragrant plants everywhere.    I had noticed that some prior reviewers were mentioning teething issues considering it´s a new resort. But I am happy to report that we did not notice and at all!    Location:  It´s located quite central in Marrakesh and just a 10 minute drive from the airport. But somehow it manages to be incredibly calm and quiet (I presume the 16 hectares of land helps...)! But after having taken a look at the empty land surrounding the resort i foresee a lot of potential construction in the future...?    Hotel:  It´s not a beast with its mere 141 rooms and out of those 27 are suites. So despite the size of the main building it somehow manages to give a rather intimate feel.    Room:  We had 2 interconnecting rooms (320 and 321). I do like the system they use here which is to simply shut off a 3rd door in the hallway which gives a much more spacious feel!  Our rooms were located on the 3rd floor out of 4 (there are only the presidential and royal suites on the 4th) and facing the adult pool (more quiet!) and with a bonus view of the Atlas mountains. If you do choose a similar room you will not have either direct morning or evening sun.  The rooms were spacious with a functional layout and 2 large balconies. The beds and pillows (really loved the pillows!) very comfortable with high quality bedlinen    Plus:  * Large  * Sensible layout  * Ample storage for suitcases and clothes  * His and hers sinks  * Separate shower and bathtub  * Separate toilet  * Very quiet and efficent AC. Easily adjusted  * Possible to make room very dark. Important!  * Fast and stable WiFi  * Good water pressure  * Nice view  * Sparkling or still water was replanished daily together with fresh fruits or snacks    Minus:  * Very bland decor. It wouldn´t have hurt to implement some more genuine intricate Moroccan flavours IMO. BUT!!! we were told that they are currently in the process of implementing more colours and local decorations in the rooms so that should be all improved in no time!!!  * No beach bag in the room which is always handy to have no matter if one is heading to the beach or to the pool    AC:  Blissfully quiet and very efficent. Also easy to operate!    Pools:  There are 3 fresh water pools. One small one just for the kids club (shaded) and then 1 family and 1 adult pool. Now the family and adult pools are very separated ensuring peace over on the adult side. They are both large and have a beautiful AND practical layout. They are thankfully heated during the slightly colder season  The only slightly negative thing about the family pool is that there´s not really a wading area for the smallest kids unless toddling around on the steps count...  I also like the little snacks and refreshments that were handed out. Plus there is also a small spa menu for lighter/shorter treatments to be had poolside    Kids club:  Wonderful!! It is huge and very well equipped. We can not say enough good things about Samira who was absolutely lovely with our daughter! The activity schedule is varied and should have something to offer everyone no matter of interests    Food/restaurants:  We were in general very impressed with the food. Only encountered a small propblem with our in room dining which was swiftly rectified.    Inara: They do have a nice and varied lighter menu for an afternoon snack or light lunch  Solano: This is where breakfast is served and also where their Moroccan fare is served at night. The breakfast buffet is very large has a great selection is always fresh and an appealing presentation! Dinner at night holds very high standard as well  Bleu d´Orange: Lovely setting/decor food is fabulous and service very attentive  Azzara: Nice relaxed atmosphere for having lunch next to the adult pool. Good food and good mood. They do also do an indian themed night there sometimes which we highly recommend!!  In room dining: They were always right on time as promised. Very nicely set up in room and fresh. The odd time they got something wrong it was rectified as ASAP!  Food by the pool: It´s not possible to have any by the family pool (too bad). But there is a small but nice selection available next to the adult pool  Childrens menu: Deifinitely on the small side... And no healthy options such as non fried items or vegetables. Must say that there is room for improvement here!!!    Spa:  It´s located at the far end of the property and very serene.  My husband had a massage de Marrakesh and wasn´t bowled over by it but perfectly content. I had a full hammam which was great! Not sure that i have ever been as clean as after that treatment...I highly recommend my therapist Aisha (sp?) as she was pleasant efficent and thorough!  Also nice that there is a spa menu ""light"" by the pools with treatments that can be done poolside!  Internet:  There are 2 services they offer. There´s the slightly slower ""every day"" wifi which is perefctly fine for checking emails and whatever social networking needs one has. But for things that require a bit more speed they also offer a faster wifi for 15 Euro per day and 3 devices  Also the wifi connection is more than spotty by both pools which is annoying    Staff/service:  Now they were almost the best thing about this resort! We did not encounter a single employee that were not genuinely friendly very service minded and had that extra personal touch. And they all made sure to pay a bit of extra attention to our young daughter who happily lapped it all up!  They sure do go that extra mile to ensure that you have a great stay!!!    Amenities/Minibar:  The amenties are pretty basic and they provide the usual L´Occitane.  The minibar has a decent selection but is actually very expensive... come on 8 euros for a can of coke?    Laundry:  It was done in no time almost! Back in our room before even 2 hours were up! And in perfect condition    Shopping:  They do have a lovely boutique on site with a nice selection of clothes for both adults and children plus quite a lot of nice objects for the house as well. There is also some books and sunscreens for sale. But no magazines so make sure to stock up on that before coming here!    Transfer from an to the airport:  I definitely recommend that you book this! We were whisked away before hitting immigration and ushered into a lounge where we relaxed drank water and ate cookies while our papers were taken care of. And then they swiftly sorted out our luggages too. Very painless process!!  And it was just as good when we were driven back to the airport    Things to do:  We did book a half day tour of the Medine Souk and Jeema el-Fna. I HIGHLY recommend our tour guide Ali who was every bit a helpful gentleman and i challenge you to ask him a question that he does not know the answer too!!! The Medina part was all right the souk a lot better than i expected as we didn´t feel hustled at all and it was all very calm and civilized. Jeema el-Fna should probably be visited at night time for a better experience but over all we really enjoyed our tour and that had a lot to do with our most excellent guide    Would we stay here again?:  Definitely! But most likely for a long weekend/short week. I would say that 4-5 days here is enough and perfect to just remain on the property. Unless of course one wants to induldge in a lot of excursions and activities outside of the resort",Date of stay: October 2012,Trip type: Traveled with family,Glasgow,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Asta72
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,TripperEurope1 wrote a review Oct 2012,40,Rating problems,"The problem with understanding hotel ratings in Marrakech is due to the lack of distinction on Tripadvisor and elsewhere between Hotels and Riads. Riads should we think be classified as B&B not as hotels. Some Riads are simply paradisiac some are disastrous and we will never again venture there unless we have very reliable first hand information. As far as hotels are concerned the Four Seasons is ... a Four Seasons. Perfection all around at a high price. The best hard trying and dedicated staff in the industry.  The resort is brand new impeccably clean. Two great pools one for families and one for adults (no shouting there !) a dream. Excellent restaurants superb breakfast (at London or Paris prices) great sunset bars good spa but this could and should be improved on. A very well organised boutique with quality items at reasonable prices. Location is fine too away but not to far from the Mediana and very close to the airport.  One important caveat between 2 and 4 in the morning the airco switches off and uncomfortable heath woke us up sweating every night at 330 AM we found it quite unacceptable. We got no credible explanation. Is it a money saving measure ? At these room prices ? That is the only reason why we can't give the Four Seasons Resort Marrakech an ""excellent"" rating.",Date of stay: October 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Europe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TripperEurope1
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Reviewer42 wrote a review Oct 2012,50,Loved it!,Having prebooked the VIP pick up we were met off the plane and escorted through to the VIP lounge where complementary drinks and snacks were waiting. They handled immigration and after a short wait we were whisked through to a waiting E Class Merc. We had the same service on our return and I can definitely recommend this service.    On arrival we were greeted by name and given cold towels and mint tea. As we arrived at 10 am our room was not quite ready but we were allocated a temporary room and told that the bellboy would move our luggage later. In our room I was amazed to find a birthday cake (I'd mentioned that the trip was in celebration of my BIG birthday) along with champagne and roses. It was an unexpected trreat delicious and much appreciated - thank you!!    Our room was spacious beautifully docorated and had a lovely view of the gardens and the Atlas Mountains. Bottled water was continuously refreshed and the beds were so comfortable. We also had a big terrace with a table 2 very comfortable chairs and an alcove sofa complete with a mountain of cushions.    Food was expensive as expected but well presented and delicious.    We organised a guide to take us through the Souks and he was excellent - well worth it as we would never have found our way around and he made us feel very safe.    The pools were lovely although we actually preferred the children's pool as we mostly sunbathed in afternoon and we could sunbathe in the privacy of the personal sun tents. We also appreciated the fruit skewers that they served.    The staff could not do enough to help you and really offered a personal service. We had a great holiday -thanks so much to all the staff at the Four Seasons for making our trip so special.

They chatted and joked with us and made us feel very welcome.    The rooms and bathrooms were spacious and beautifully decorated with a big balcony: everything was extremely comfortable and modern with enough room that we could all spend time in one room if we wanted to be together. And of course the famous Four Seasons beds are simply the best!    There is a choice of restaurants and although the menu isn't hugely extensive everything on it is exquisitely prepared (not much variety for a vegetarian but something for them to eat in each restaurant). We particularly enjoyed the Moroccan restaurant.    There are two fantastic (and big) pools to choose from. The staff wander by fairly regularly to make sure you have drinks and anything else you need.    The hotel pick up and drop off at the airport is an excellent service and doesn't actually add much to the price. It really is hassle free (they even take care of immigration for you).    Unsurprisingly this is an expensive place to stay but it truly is worth every penny.

The hotel has two swimming pools one for adults and the other for families and this works well for those of us who enjoy relaxing on holiday away from the sound of children. The restaurants are well run and the food is of a very good quality with excellent service.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Karin B wrote a review Sep 2012,40,Very very nice,We went to Marrakech on business and choosed the four seasons for this 5 days-stay. The building is quite new and modern as we like it. Lots of light staff very friendly. It's a pitty they don't have anyone waitering the swimming pool area and you often have to get up to order your drinks at the bar but the swimming pools are lovely and much attended by the friendly lifeguard. It's all very relaxing. Massages at the spa or the swimming pool are lovely ask for Tarek or Yanounes (or something like that) they are just the best. I have had massages all around the world I can compare this massages with ones I got in Bali. Restaurant are very nice but there is so much to discover in Marrakech they give you a list of restaurant to visit in the city. Definitely try the french restaurant of La Mamounia. The courtesy limousine of the four seasons will bring you there (5min drive) no extra charge asked. The only thing that disappointed me a little bit was the fact that I couldn't get any other pillow (there were quite big and I have a neck issue so I need a good pillow not too big) something all good hotels offer normally. Oh yes before I forget take their VIP service offer to go back to the airport it's really worth its money!  If we have to go back we definitely are choosing the 4 seasons again.,Date of stay: September 2012,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Tenerife, Spain",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KarinB480
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Mack-73 wrote a review Sep 2012,50,A wonderful family break,We (Me Wife son (4½) have just returned from a fabulous 8 night stay at the Four Seasons Marrakech. This genuinely family friendly hotel gave us excellent service from our initial contact prior to arrival until we departed for the airport.    The accommodation was first class which would be expected from such a new hotel. We stayed in an Executive Suite in the main building which met our needs perfectly large bedroom a lounge (which was converted into a bedroom each evening) walk in wardrobe 2 toilets 2 showers a bath which literally could fit us all in and a large balcony with table chairs and sun loungers. The room also had a good size mini bar and access to USB ports and 3 pin plug sockets which were very useful given we had forgotten our travel adaptor (incidentally the hotel also supplied one for our stay). We had a long discussion on where this room ranked in all of our holidays and it made the top 3 - final placing’s couldn’t be agreed upon but we loved it.  As you would expect the bathrooms were stocked with large amounts of the L’Occcatain range. We are personally big fans of the L’Occatain product range and we find it an added bonus to any Four Seasons visit.    The hotel restaurants are excellent in particular Solano where the food was fabulous and the Moroccan wine we tried was wonderful and something we’ll be looking for now we’re home. There are not many choices but we had no need to leave the hotel to eat. This in part was due to our stay overlapping with Ramadan and our son would not have been able to wait to eat after sunset when the restaurants in the city would open. We were aware of this when booking so despite this meaning we did not get to enjoy some of the fabulous cuisine the city can offer (we’d experienced this on a prior visit) it was of no concern and should not prevent people staying during Ramadan.    The staff were friendly helpful and very welcoming and they all seemed to know our name’s! They treated our son royally and nothing was too much trouble to ensure his enjoyment. He particularly liked his name on the door when we arrived and the personalised plate of sweets and hand printed t-shirt which was given to him. Initially we thought the children’s menu’s was limited which is something the hotel could consider reviewing however when we started asking for what he wanted bypassing the formal menu there was no concern whether it was Pizza fruit salad or a cheese and tomato sandwich. They even learnt to make his favourite drink Jumeirah Beach’s “Little Rascal” orange juice lemonade with a dash of grenadine (by the end of the stay the dash was just right).    We also enjoyed our time in the Inara Bar where a special mention to bar manager Mohamed has to made as he seemed to end up with a large percentage of our son’s bespoke requirements.    The hotel was also very caring. When our son was unwell on a visit to the city the guide quickly got us back to the hotel and by the time we had got back to our hotel room reception was on the phone asking if we needed any assistance or a Doctor calling. This was not required but knowing that help was there if required was a great relief. The hotel also checked on his well-being the next day to make sure he was feeling better (he was).    We made minimal use of the Kids Club and Young Adults centre but what we saw and used were good particularly the climbing wall. One minor point but an easy fix would be to have a greater choice of English speaking DVD’s at the young adults centre movie theatre our son loved “Space Buddies “ but I know we’d have preferred to have watch some of the other options which were only in French.    We spent most of our time around the beautiful family pool where despite us regularly getting there before the staff the facilities were excellent and we benefitted from having sun tents as opposed to the traditional sun umbrella. We particularly enjoyed the sample smoothies and the fruit kebabs but our son did miss not getting ice lollies as given out in similar resorts.    My wife and I both had treatments at the Spa which were of high quality and in comparison to UK prices excellent value for money.    We used the laundry facility on one occasion and I can say I’ve never had laundry return wrapped in tissue paper ribbon and in a leather box. It was also immaculately clean and pressed.    We had no genuine issues are there things which can be improved – yes but I believe the management are aware of them and are working towards their resolution. We had a great holiday and will definitely return.,Date of stay: August 2012,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Sunderland, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mack-73

The rooms are big with comfortable beds and really were the best accommodations we've ever experienced. The food is really good. The employees are friendly and the housekeeping service was outstanding. I will admit that being it's a Four Seasons we had very high expectations. The only item that did not live up to our expectations was the speed of service. On many occasions we found it hard to place a drink or meal order and on almost all occasions the wait to receive the item was substantially longer than expected.    Overall we did have a wonderful time and would return again. I would have given it a 4.5 stars if that was an option.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Ants48 wrote a review Sep 2012,40,Overall a great stay but room for improvement,We stayed during July 2012 for four nights. The resort was virtually empty with only about 20 rooms occupied and we were given a free upgrade to a Deluxe Room with a great view. The rooms themselves are beautifully appointed and very spacious. Wonderful bed and I particularly loved the décor. The public areas of the resort are absolutely beautiful and particularly so at night when they are illuminated.    The staff are wonderful very polite helpful and accommodating typical FS.    The food is generally great room service was tasty and hot the breakfast in Solano was wonderful and extensive. Dinner in Solano was also a treat make sure you sit outside looking out to the resort magical. Blue d’Orange had an amazing setting but the food wasn’t as good as in Solano. The Azzera Grill was my least favoured option a sub-par hamburger for lunch combined with very slow service. They also got my order wrong on the first day and completely forgot about our order on the second day.    The Spa was wonderful and the treatments we had were great.    On the flipside some public areas such as the bathrooms are not air conditioned with I thought was rather odd. The poolside service really needs attention as there are no staff at the Children’s pool to help set you up with towels etc. There is a staff member at the adults only pool but it was hit and miss if they helped you set up under a cabana or on a lounge chair. They also don’t bring you free water which is a glaring omission from a resort of this calibre. They still bring you the occasional treat here and there but the poolside service was inferior to the other resort style pools in other FS that I’ve been to (namely Hong Kong and Maui) I also found the gym to be wanting and not really befitting of a five star resort.    Overall a great stay just need to work on the service at the pool and at the Azzera Grill.,Date of stay: July 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Melbourne, Australia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ants48

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,tint7003 wrote a review Sep 2012,40,Four Seasons quality is alive and well in Marrakech,We stayed for five nights in early September and really enjoyed this property. We were allocated a spacious ground floor pavilion room with an outdoor terrace. The room was very comfortably furnished and the huge bathroom was luxurious and well fitted.    Most days we sat by the pool. There are two large pools one for adults only and the other for guests with children. Pool service was excellent and we enjoyed lunch each day in the poolside Azzera restaurant. Breakfast too was a highlight offering a daily special hot dish and wonderful buffet tables with Moroccan and a wide choice of international dishes. There was also a special juice drink which changed every few days and this was delicious too.    The spa was superb offering a range of local treatments (loved the Hammam experience) as well as the usual massage options and treatments.    Staff throughout the Resort were unfailingly courteous and attentive and service was close to faultless. We felt very welcome in the Resort and there was nothing that was too much trouble.    There were only two disappointments for us - evening dinner options and the return airport transfer. The hotel offers Solana a Moroccan restaurant which we tried but found the food there rather tasteless. There is also Blue Orange - an Italian where the food was better but this option is only open five nights of the week. Both of these restaurants were empty when we dined there and it might be that guests mostly choose to eat outside the hotel. The only other on-site dining options were the room service menu and a very limited selection of dishes (mini burgers quesadilla etc) in the Inara Lounge and Bar. As we left there was about to be a ‘pop up’ Indian restaurant operating for one night and hopefully the Hotel will do more of this as we found the evening dining experience limited a little soul-less and rather underwhelming.    For 650MAD each way (per car) you are met on arrival at the Airport priority cleared through immigration and then driven the ten minute journey from the airport to the Hotel. Our arrival transfer worked well but on the return the car dropped us in the airport car park and we had to drag our cases some distance into the airport terminal while the driver walked alongside us empty handed. No assistance with baggage was offered by him or anyone else until we were inside the Terminal. Regular taxis on the other hand are a fraction of the cost and drop passengers right outside the terminal. Immigration queues were minimal going both in and out of Marrakech at the times we travelled so overall we didn’t feel the Hotel’s transfer service was as good as it needs to be and we would probably make our own arrangements in future.    Overall though we returned home feeling very refreshed and with very happy memories of the Four Seasons Marrakech and we very much hope to return someday soon.,Date of stay: September 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, England.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tint7003

Breakfast in the Solano presents an enviable choice of food .The food in the Bleu d'orange was delicious and we were particularly impressed with Karim the manager there.  The Inara bar with its air con is a pleasant choice for cocktails in the evening or a light lunch midday. The adult pool was glorious and peaceful with attentive poolside staff and good food at the Azzera Restaurant. A visit to the spa is a must!  Our room was just outstanding with room service and house keeping prompt and of an excellent standard.  We would highly recommend this hotel,Date of stay: August 2012,Trip type: Traveled with family,East Cholderton,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GPG123
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,BarbadosJaguar wrote a review Sep 2012,50,Highly Recommended,I stayed with my son and his family at this wonderful hotel which exceeded our expectations.  The General Manager went out of his way each day to personally make sure we were all satisfied with our stay. All the staff were polite and most friendly they couldn't do enough for us. The restaurants are superb. The grounds delightful and the pool are is just stunning with cabanas to enjoy. The kids club is also excellent with plenty of choice of entertainment. As soon as we drove into the Palm tree lined avenue we felt very welcome by the Management as they came out to greet us. My grandchildren aged 10 8 and 6 absolutely loved the holiday and they all have asked to go back again!! Yes please the sooner the better. A most charming hotel and highly recommended!!,Date of stay: July 2012,Trip type: Traveled with family,Barbados,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BarbadosJaguar
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Charles S wrote a review Sep 2012,50,Tarik (Spa Masseur) is reason enough to book this hotel,Tarik is the best. Book a massage wih him -- 90 minutes. He's pure genius.    Overall the propertly is luxurious and grand. The food is fantastic the grounds are fantastic. The pool and cabanas are superb.    The resort location is farther from the medina than I originally thought -- it is not within walking distance; however the taxis are easy and inexpensive -- and it takes only minutes to get anywhere within the medina. I do not regret bypassing the more authentic riads and staying at the Four Seasons. It was well worth the time and the money.    I started my days with a fantastic breakfast. I have stayed in luxury hotels all over the world -- and this hotel breakfast was very very good. The afternoons I would spend at the pool in a cabana drinking cocktails and taking a swim. The August afternoons are so oppressively hot that the cabanas serve the perfect shelter from the brutal direct sun. I became plenty tan even sitting in the covered cabana.    The rooms are nice as one would expect. I was upgraded to the executive suite - 2 bathrooms beautiful balcony heavenly bed. Very nice.    I spent every evening in the medina eating dinner and watching the incredible entertainment.    The hotel recommends great restaurants in the medina -- but I have a great tip -- do not eat at Le Comptoir Darna just go there for drinks around 10:00pm and see the belly dancing. The show is worth the trip but the food is not great. Go just for drinks and to see the show. If youwant an amazing dinner - go to Gastro MK. It's an uber amazing Riad with an even more amazing dinner. Some of the best food going.,Date of stay: August 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"New York City, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CharlesS114
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Charles G wrote a review Aug 2012,50,Just go there!,We went there as a family recently and were very happy. There rooms are great the food available was great; all very comfortable indeed.    Furthermore having never had a massage before I decided to try one. As a young man with lots of randoms pains from every sport under the sun I was a bit apprehensive. My advice: go there ask for Tarik regardless of who u are and have a massage just do it.    Also if you are a golf fan then there are lots of great courses out there the hotels next to them may only be building sites but the golf is fantastic (I found the 'Al Maaden' was a favourite).

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Neena OBE wrote a review Aug 2012,50,Pure Luxury!,I have just stayed at this resort for a week and I have to say that the experience amazing. We did not want for anything- I could not fault it. It was worth every penny. I chose the four seasons because it was a little away from the hub hub- and it was absolutely the right decision it was a haven. We were upgraded to a pavilion room and it was huge with a huge bathroom dressing room and private garden area- wow! With BBc 1 and 2!!  The restaurants were excellent and there was a lavish buffet breakfast with freshly squeezed orange and grapefruit juice.  The pool area-adult was calm and relaxing and the pool water was like mineral water.  The spa massages were out of this world and the hammam was pure indulgence. Do it at the hotel NOT in the medina!

It's the service which I thought was the best I have ever experienced. The waiters know the guests name when we show up at breakfast. The Concierge made great suggestions and remembered everything they had arranged earlier. Courteous and helpful drivers were around to assist us with airport transport and trips to restaurants.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,GFPDUB wrote a review Aug 2012,50,A one word summary; WOW...,I'm lost for words to describe the experience that I just had at the Four Seasons Resort Marrakech; EVERYTHING from check-in to check-out five days later was EXCELLENT.    We arrived on Sunday 12 August and were met on arrival in the Airport by a Four Seasons Representative to collected our luggage from the baggage carousel and fast-tracked us through passport control. A black Range Rover Vogue awaited us in the carpark to bring us on the short hop to the Four Seasons Resort Marrakech located in a Rosemary scented oasis very close to the Marrakech-Menara Airport (RAK).    Check-in was done with speed and comfort. We were informed that we had been upgraded from a Standard Room to a Superior Room. Most hotel rooms are typicall nothing more than a beige box not the Four Seasons Resort Marrakech though. Our room was very well appointed with views over the gardens.    The silver-grey slate and gold sandstone surrounding the Adult Only swimming pool is a pleasant departure from the ubiquitos Aqua Marine blue mosic tiles found in many other properties. The water in the pool was as clear and fresh as bottled spring water.    The bed and bed-linen were of such a high standard that an exceptional nights sleep was guarenteed. ALL of the staff were friendly and helpful two in particular deserve special mention - Salma who worked the breakfast room every morning during our stay and Sofia at the Concierge Desk.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Serial_Traveller wrote a review Jul 2012,30,Not Really A Four Seasons At All .... Yet!,I am going to base this review by comparing this Four Seasons with others around the globe and with similar properties around Marrakech.    I've previously given the Four Seasons in Tokyo a 5*+ - and I'd give the New York and Paris a 5*+ so there's no way the Marrakech one comes up to the standards of those great hotels so it seems ridiculous for anyone to consider giving it 5*. Perhaps we now expect too much of the Four Seasons afterall they seem to now open as often as Starbucks.    There's no excuse for people to still say the Four Seasons Marrakech has teething problems - it's now been open for 1 year. So no excuses please. You're paying top dollar so I want to be given top dollar standards in return.    We found ourselves repeatedly asking for various amenities that had not been replaced and we too would have to ask for dirty cups etc to be taken away. Housekeeping would clean the room and still dirty items would be left behind. Let's not blame the staff these are management issues. Often the basics which are in a bathroom were missing. Where's the soap? Flannels?    Yes the grounds are large - the pools are fabulous. I certainly give top marks to the fact that there's an adults only pool and a kids pool and they are virtually the same thus stopping kids wanting to be in the adult pool presuming we had something better. However anyone who thinks the grounds of the Four Seasons Marrakech amazing needs to take a trip to the Palais Namaskar Marrakech to see what the definition of amazing is.    We thought our Deluxe room was bland beyond belief - it had no sense of luxury at all. Very uninspiring no sense of decoration or art. Marrakech is such an inspiring place full of people who have done the most creative things with riads and restaurants so it beggars belief that the designer of this hotel was so uncreative.    So in truth the Four Seasons Marrakech is quite nice. It's not amazing or stunning or the overly used word 'awesome'. No hotels are awesome - the Grand Canyon is awesome not a hotel room or a club sandwich. And certainly there's no sense of being in or around Marrakech at this resort. But I guess it's nice enough for a long weekend away - but there's certainly very little WOW-factor.    In my opinion there really are better places if you want to be outside the medina and stay at a large hotel with landscaped grounds. For all these reasons this particular Four Season can only possibly be given 3 stars. And if this is the only hotel you've stayed at in Marrakech then you've not really stayed at or experienced what Marrakech has to offer at all.    .,Date of stay: July 2012,Trip type: Traveled with family,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Serial_Traveller
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,BusinessBrit wrote a review Jul 2012,50,Luxurious and restful retreat,TEN minutes by cab from the bedlam of the Medina and its teeming souks this luxurious and calming oasis provides welcome relief after the frenzy of the old town. The hotel is almost brand new and everything from bedrooms to public areas is up to the usual superlative Four Seasons standard. Staff are friendly courteous and extremely willing. Gardens are huge and beautiful scented with thyme lavender rosemary and eucalyptus. Inside the Moroccan theme is evident but done with tasteful understatement: mint tea at reception and atmospheric lanterns on the terraces but no kitsch. A comfortable siting room even has faint touches of Chatsworth about it with marble fireplace and bookshelves containing lavish tomes about life in the desert. Swimming pools are excellent: a large family one with a clever design to amuse les enfants and a superb adults-only one vast and serene expertly serviced by charming and helpful attendants who bring round the freebie ice creams and mini smoothies. Breakfast buffet first rate. Rooms opulent and supremely comfortable with latest in super-efficient aircon digital TVs and gadgetry; bathrooms ditto. We had large comfy balconies overlooking gardens with table chairs and a sofa with giant fan overhead. The hotel seems to be working hard to eliminate minor housekeeping glitches referred to previously on this site. We had two adjoining rooms sharing a common lockable entrance door which worked very well for us and found our rooms well serviced with frequent checks to ensure we were happy (although turndown was slightly hit or miss a couple of nights).The management kindly sent up a delicious chocolate birthday cake and flowers for our daughter’s 18th an impressive touch and thank you. We made good use of the courtesy car for evening trips into the city and found the concierge and his team very helpful. But you will need cabs to get anywhere at all and it’s worth paying a little extra (say £10 instead of £5) for a decent air conditioned taxi which the desk can whistle up for you. Generally cabs are very cheap even if the cabbies downtown triple the fare when you ask for the Four Seasons. It is perhaps naïve to expect anything else. Spa superb and we enjoyed two dreamy massages on a 2-for-1 special July deal costing just £70 for two one-hour massages. Not bad value. Our only other observation is that the hotel might be more adventurous with its dining options. Admittedly we have just come back from low season when not everything can be expected to be running full blast but if there had been a bit more variety on site then we might have stayed in more rather than go downtown. There is a decent Italian on site but with a fairly narrow menu: maybe expand that a bit? Or perhaps a steak and seafood bar? On the other hand going into the heart of the city is half the reason for coming to Marrakech so most guests will probably be happy. As for the fabled heat incidentally we enjoyed it tremendously after the grim British summer and it is a bone dry heat so no mozzies – a real bonus. On top of that the low season deal makes the Four Seasons great value at this time of year. One or two on this site have gently moaned about high bar and food prices and they are indeed not cheap but no more than you’d pay in a hotel or restaurant of this quality elsewhere and who goes to the Four Seasons expecting bargain basement anyway?

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,clairelouise2007 wrote a review Jul 2012,50,Exceptionally luxury unsurpassed,We are big fans of the Four Seasons having stayed in many across Europe and in Sharm El Sheik for 5 consecutive years for the sunshine. So when the Four Seasons Marrakech opened we were delighted to have a shorter flight to the sunshine. We chose the VIP meet and greet which was the perfect fast track start to our 9 nights of unrivalled in luxury and service. The entire hotel is furnished as you would expect a Four Seasons to be no expense is spared in the common areas the luxurious drapes hang in the elegantly furnished bars and lounges. The Four Seasons signature fresh flowers are in abundance their beauty doesn't disappoint. Everything is exceptionally clean the cleaning staff keeping everything spotless. We had a Deluxe room with a great view of the main pool we expected a large room with high quality comfortable furnishings plenty of storage and that's exactly what we got. The bed was large and extremely comfortable. Breakfast was high quality with a lot of variety and served by attentive staff who remembered our particularly daily preferences. We ate in the hotel every night using the whole host of dining options from in-room dining to bar meals to a la carte. All of the food was very good and beautifully presented the variety wasn’t enough though for 9 nights and it did feel limited. Mind you we could have left the hotel and had a whole world of variety but we chose not to do that on this occasion.  All in all it was an excellent stay and we will return again and will highly recommend to anyone who asks for a proper 5* hotel to stay in Marrakech.,Date of stay: July 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Hertford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clairelouise2007
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,CorneliusfudgeGM wrote a review Jul 2012,50,Four Seasons Marrakech - GO,When I heard that Four Seasons had arrived in Marrakech I wanted to visit. Some of the earlier reviews have made reference to what must have been early teething problems which in the main have been ironed out. Our experience was as follows;  We had arranged to pick up transfer from the airport and what a slick operation. Met at the gate whisked into a comfy lounge escorted through a dedicated immigration channel helped with luggage black Range Rover waiting outside and then whisked to the hotel. Slick and well worth it. And just as slick on the way out.  At the hotel we were met and in our room within 10-15 minutes even though several groups had arrived at the same time.  We had a Pavilion Room which was large with dining area and a large terrace with lounges etc.  Room service was always delivered at the time they quote you when ordering. Poolside service was spot on. Any restaurants I asked the hotel to book were done. They organized an excellent guide for our visits to Majorelle Gardens souks and the Medina.  I had been tweeting and offered a cocktail master class by Federico the sommelier. I thought this would have been forgotten but whilst in resort they tweeted me and offered up the master class in how to make a great mojito. Federico and the guys were great and we had a great evening as a result.  We did visit and dine at La Mamounia and your choice of hotel will come down to personal choice not necessarily cost. I could have stayed at La Mamounia for less then the Pavilion Room at Four Seasons. When I return as I will which will I choose. Four Seasons without a doubt.

Hotel staff are all absolutely delightful helpful and the most courteous out of the 6 hotels we stayed in on our trip. Our room was extremely spacious with a walk in robe with racks for 2 suitcases which is rare huge bathroom with separate loo outdoor area and traditional warm Moroccan decor. Beautiful and extremely comfortable.  A few friends who had been to Marrakech thought we should have stayed in the Medina though driving out of the hussle bussle back to the hotels peace quiet and open space was very settling. Its barely a 10 minute drive.  Breakfast was amazing as were drinks of an evening in the lounge and dinner outdoors even though the temps were around 35 at night. We did not have lunch at the hotel as we were always out and about during the day.  The concierge organised Hisham our fabulous driver and guide and we were taken on the most fantastic trip to Berber country. The second trip was out to the coast for lunch and a look around Essaouira.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,cisparkle wrote a review Jul 2012,50,wonderfull experience,We have just returned from 3nights at this hotel and felt like we had been away longer due to the fact that it was so fantastic . The staff are some of the best I have come across across the board from the very elegent lady who checked us in to the duty manager who helped us with anything we needed to Rachid who served us lunch by the pool who seemed to know our name from the moment we sat down .  Rooms we stayed in were the Pavillion Suite and it was large with very nice bathroom lounge and plunge pool outside on the patio with sunbeds and table these rooms are all set around the pool area which we liked . We also saw a Pavillion room that was in the same block also very nice it reminded me of the Royal Mirage Arabian Court in Dubai.  Food we ate at Bleu de Orange and it was excellent and not overpriced at all . Zest bar was great but not open after the weekend which was a shame and the restaurant they serve breakfast in overlooks fountains so a very nice way to start the day.  Spa treatment I had a Morrocan massage and was not expecting much but it was one of the best massages I have ever had also the Spa itself is beautiful with lovely relaxation areas and gardens for after your treatment the staff here were some of the nicest I have come across. They arranged for a lady to visit the spa to do my henna paint on my hand so this way I need not bother with the hassel of the Medina to have it done . less than half the price I pay in Dubai too.  The hotels grounds are already looking very nice and are fragrant even though the hotel has not been open more than a year.  We visited La Mamoumia and Royal Mansour for dinner and although they are both stunning I found the staff at La Mamoumia to be very pretentious lots of looking you up and down.... so it would not have been so relaxing with that and we needed to re charge which is exectly what we did at the Four seasons.Staff at the Royal Mansour were charming but you are set in Riads around the grounds so not as much space to walk around as I would likealso our guide mentioned that he thought he liked the look of our hotel more than the Amenjena we did not see it ourselves so I couldnt say .  So to finish I think this hotel is doing everythig just write ofcourse the hotel is stunning it is a Four Seasons that goes without saying but it is the Staff that we found that made this Hotel . We will be coming back.,Date of stay: July 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Jersey, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cisparkle

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,ubergirl17 wrote a review Jul 2012,40,"stunning property, still a few kinks to work out",The Four Seasons is a gorgeous property. The location is great--outside the medina but a short taxi ride to almost anywhere including the airport. We had a wonderful time. I loved the pools lounge areas roof top bar and beautiful finishes. The property itself is five stars.  I give it a four star review because as a Four Seasons the service needs to come together a bit more before it is on par with other Four Seasons. For the rate paid I expect seamless phenomenal service. My other issue is that the pricing for food beverage and amenities is over the top. Prime example: the buffet breakfast is $40/person for a good but not extraordinary buffet.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,HassanBen wrote a review Jun 2012,40,A relaxing getaway,"Stayed at the Four Seasons Marrakech for 2 nights on the weekend.  First impression upon check-in was bad. There was a mixup regarding the reservation. The room (superior king) has already been paid for but the check-in agent insisted on charging my credit card the equivalent of 700 EUR as a guarantee. The check-in agent (a moroccan man) even told me: ""but if we don't have a guarantee who is going to pay for the room ?"". I thought it was rude and unprofessional especially when it was his fault for not checking the info correctly on his file. After going back-and-forth between the reception and the lobby it turned out i was right and I was escorted to my room without any explanation or apology. Not a great start and certainly not the standard of Four Seasons !  The rest of the stay was lovely and uneventful. The poolside spa and breakfast staff were all very helpful and smiling. The room is very nice. The bathroom experience is definitely a must bathroom amenities (L'Occitane) a plus. Balcony with reading corner is a treat. Turndown service at night very nice. And the dark tiled adult pool was the perfect balance between relaxation and fun.  Breakfast buffet was good although not fantastic.  I also happened to lose my swimsuit which I wrapped in a towel in the room. Housekeeping took away the towel and I only noticed this the following morning. Staff were very professional and managed to find it for me at the laundry building.  Overall a nice and relaxing hotel in a lush surrounding.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,SFRLondon wrote a review Jun 2012,30,"""Could do better ...""",We had been to Marrakech 8 years ago and had stayed at La Mamoumia and when we heard that there was a Four seasons which had opened up we decided to go as it also coincided with half term. Marrakech is an interesting place. Its changed a lot in the 8 years when we were there last become much more touristy but the good thing is that the Four seasons is about 10 minutes from the Medina and 10 min from the Airport so you can have a haven of peace away from the Medina. Inside the hotel compound it really is peace and tranquility.  We have stayed at numerous Four Seasons across the globe as we know what to expect and we are seldom let down. Sadly this hotel appears to be having some teething problems which are easily rectifiable. Management appear to missing and the staff try quite hard. There is a sprinkling of foreign staff lower than most Four Seasons i have been to. The locals try but there doesn't appear to be much direction. I ordered some lunch at the family pool and after an hour i decided to give up and went to the main Azzera restaurant. The following day I was told i had left without waiting for lunch. On another occassion we stayed in and had dinner at the Solano restaurant. After waiting for about hour for the main course the food arrived but cold. The food was sent back and once again we waited for the food to arrive but this time we gave up and left. Also the rooms were made over later on in the day often i had to phone to request it. The turndown in the evening was hit and miss in that on a few occassions it wasn't done. The main gripes we have with the hotel is the service people just forget. This is just not the type of service that Four Season is renouned for.    The positives. The hotel is near enough to the medina but yet far enough so that you can escape the hustle and bustle. The hotel has complimentary cars to the medina after 18:00 which is a nice touch (you have to make your own way back). Finally a Four Seasons that gives you complimentary Wifi ( yes its free !! ). People have commented on the fact that it does lack some Morrocan heritage which is probably true. I liked the light and airy feel of the hotel but it could easily have been a Four Season in any big city rather than one in Marrakech.    A nice hotel which is somewhat let down by poor service and an absence of management.,Date of stay: June 2012,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SFRLondon
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Monty H wrote a review Jun 2012,50,Exquisite... in every way,Our first trip to Marrakech and Morocco was motivated by the opportunity to stay at the Four Seasons Resort and we were not let down. From our VIP arrival and transfer at the airport to our upgrade to a Deluxe Room on arrival... all under the cover of darkness. Large water bottles and a selection of cakes and fruit bowl upon entering the room were just what we needed after a day of airports and planes.    We awoke on our first morning to a huge private terrace with sun lounges and outdoor dining setting and a view over one of the two large pool areas on offer (one for families and one quieter area for couples). The resort must be only 2-3 years old as everything was in perfect 'new' condition - as you'd expect from Four Seasons but from time to time is not always the case at top hotels. The room was very spacious a walk-in robe separate bathroom and toilets large shower and giant bath tub.    Concierge Patricia was outstanding in helping transform our holiday from an exquisite stay at the Four Seasons to an exceptional visit to Marrakech. She organised dining options in the Medina a guide through the Souks (markets) and perhaps one of our all-time travel highlights - a private tour of the tiny Atlas Mountains village of Toulkine where we had lunch with a Berber family.    The pool areas are magnificent and importantly provided a logical delineation between couples wanting quiet time by the pool and families with children who were each able to enjoy the facilities free of each others disruption. The spa was sensational and reasonably priced. They even arranged bunch of flowers and sang 'happy birthday' for my partner - a nice personal touch. The gym well appointed with all the mod-cons although I only got to use it once!    We dined at the Blue Orange for some traditional Moroccan cuisine this was pleasant as was the Moroccan wine which we'd previously not sampled. The breakfast buffet presented endless options and the room service was exceptional - service of a very high standard and priced fairly too.    Thank you Jean-Claude and the whole team at Four Seasons Marrakech for making our first trip to Morocco a memorable one and a destination we are sure to visit again.

There are better hotels in the Four Seasons chain and many others! Having stayed in four of the chain now I think sitting here half way through the 7 night stay writing this speaks for itself. Not believing what I had read on trip advisor and having had great experiences in previous stays with the hotel group we packed our bags and here we are. Hotel is great well designed rooms  great looking pool and all in all a great location. So why the low mark......service service service or real serious lack of it. Never before have I seen such chaos as herethat being said the local staff are great and friendly but if you are prepared to wait in excess of half an hour for a drink if you want to struggle to get food if you want to watch the management throw staff at a busy period in the Azzere restaurant which meant the ratio of staff to guests was 2 to 1 but still fail to manage it thats great but not what im paying for. We felt sorry as we watched staff running round being given no direction and also found it embarrassing . I am a great believer in when you stay in a hotel you shouldn't really need to reserve a table for dinner too well that all depends if they get a little busy you will get ""Have you a reservation Sir"" where exactly in the hotel does it say I need to reserve nowhere unless it suits them. Staff are great Management poor with no management skills at all meaning they are ruining what should be another flag ship hotel. If you have come just for sun and a relax go to Four Seasons in Sharm where you will get the service period.",Date of stay: June 2012,,"Beverley, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/judeHull
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,lloni777 wrote a review Jun 2012,30,Not the best place in its category for Marrakech,I just spent 3 days at the four seasons in Marrakech. Not much to complain about but there are simply many other options at the same price point in Marrakesh. Definitely a 5 star experience but here are the drawbacks: The design does little to respect its local surroundings and charm it looks and feels like a 4 seasons too much- at times you could think you're in Palm Springs not Marrakesh. There is something austere that permeates the whole experience the bar the restaurant the pavilion room I had was very large but only a marble floor was also so far away from the main building that I had to be driven in a golf cart. Fine for a quick business trip but not up to the standard of the other great properties in Marrakesh The 2 days prior I spent at La Mamounia were truly special.,Date of stay: May 2012,Trip type: Traveled on business,"New York City, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lloni777
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Deborah G wrote a review May 2012,50,Superb customer service,What a superb hotel. Our room was lovely and the staff were fastidious in their desire to make our stay stress free and enjoyable. There were so many great touches. If we left our books lying around in the room the staff popped in a book mark for us; if we took a taxi from the hotel they provided us with fresh water bottles for the journey; they provided us with free water melon and ice cream when sitting round the pool. The general manager was attentive and responsive to our comments and has done a great job in ensuring his staff follow strict guidelines in customer service. Food although a little on the pricey side was extremely well-presented and tasty. Thank you Four Seasons.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,cbuie wrote a review May 2012,50,Perfection,As usual Four Seasons perfection. Our room was spacious and immaculate. The staff were top-notch and service was excellent. The FS Marrakech has done a wonderful job of incorporating local design and flair into this property while balancing the brand's usual tasteful neutral style. At this property you know you're in Morocco- from the plethora of beautiful lanterns elaborate archways the man serving mint tea in the lobby- the whole hotel is beautiful. The grounds are gorgeous- palm trees everywhere. They have done a great job with this hotel. It's also a great location very close to the Medina but away from the hustle and bustle. I've been wanting to go to Morocco for a long time and when the FS opened a hotel in Marrakech I knew it was time to go! Just a perfect stay all around.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,SwissGlobalTraveler wrote a review May 2012,30,"Good hotel, poor room service","We stayed at the Four Seasons Resort for four nights in a Premier room (490 EUR/night) with a great view on the entire resort and the Atlas Mountains. We enjoyed a fantastic time in Marrakech and also had a good time in the hotel but the hotel was failing on some key points it just shouldn't. We have informed the concierge on our second day and the receptionist at departure but there was no reaction from the hotel.    The hotel is located between the airport and the Medina. It takes around 10 minutes to get to ""la place"" at a cost of around 30 to 50 MAD in a mini taxi.    The facilities of the hotel are great. The spa is reasonably priced and is very relaxing. The staff at the reception the concierge and the guys at the taxi pick up were outstandingly nice and helpful. The resort is quite large and has to offer something for everyone.    Room service is highly inconsistent. It's so inconsistent that you can't believe it especially when considering that it should be a five star hotel. No replacement of empty shower gel bottles missing toilet paper taking away half full bottles of water and not replacing them not making up the room etc... we called the room service number at least 20 times during our stay. And the best the next day they made the very same mistakes - unbelievable. I've traveled in many five star hotels around the world and I'm generally not that picky but it was just so noticeable.    One evening we decided to eat at the Blue Orange restaurant in the resort. The venue is quite spectacular but that was quickly destroyed by a disastrous service and a highly impolite manager. I must say that the staff and the processes in our company canteen are more professional than in this restaurant. And check your bills they had errors in ours. The food was ok but nothing special.    At breakfast they serve great pastries. During the week we had a very relaxed breakfast and almost everything seemed fine. Well I ordered black tea every morning and they brought some herbal tea instead - each time. On Saturday morning there were more guests at breakfast and the managers were all running and commanding around and you could feel and see that the staff were stressed by the presence of the managers.    Would we recommend the hotel? If you are not picky about an inconsistent room service and if you are willing to eat out every night then I could recommend the hotel. But they should dramatically improve these elementary hotel service components.",Date of stay: May 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Zurich, Switzerland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SwissGlobalTraveler
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,MichaelLondon_UK wrote a review May 2012,50,Great management,A fairly inauspicious start - 20 minutes before the welcome drink arrived dark room with a view of a nearby block of flats - eventually gave way to a thoroughly memorable and enjoyable stay. After a few other hiccups the hotel number two Nick Yarnell moved us to a delightful suite with an equally delightful view. From that point on we could not fault the hotel. The staff (friendly and efficient) the amenities (kids and adult only pools) the rooftop bar (great DJ) and of course the food (varied and delicious) combined with highly professional hotel management means that we will return next year.,Date of stay: May 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, UK",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MichaelLondon_UK
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,mike b wrote a review May 2012,30,This property has great potential but..............,Lovely propertygreat poolscomfortable rooms........had all the characteristics of what would be expected from a 4 Seasons Hotel. We arrived for a 13 night stay and were greeted with mint tea and a relaxed welcoming check in . The weather was fantastic and all fared well for a great restful vacation.  But..........our experience was marred by service inconsistency a very average food choice (keep well clear of the Moroccan restaurant where they destroyed the traditional tagine) the noise from an open air roof top bar. and an over night pool cleaning team scraping heavy pool furniture across tiled surfaces.  Most people would only visit the hotel for a 3 or 4 night stay and want to take advantage of the variety of restaurants in Marrakech. So its difficult to build an interesting food offer at the hotel. But after 9 or so months of operation this should have been fixed.  The lack of service consistency is more surprising. Four nights without turn down;when it came there would be a night with water then a night without. A night with replacement toiletries then a night without.Basically not the seamless service usually provided by 4 Seasons.  But I guess this is manageable.  But try 3 nights of broken sleep because of ridiculous noise levels. Two nights due to the the opening of a new open air roof top bar;which is set right in the centre of the resort over looking the children's pool. Standing in reception at 12.30 am asking that the DJ turn down the volume was not a great experience. The same happened the next night; having been promised that it would not happen again. Eventually on the second night the Front Office Manager came to the room and was visibly shocked by the noise level. But 2 nights of appalling late noise; more appropriate to the 18-30 Club not a 4 Seasons was not fun  .And then a third night of noise as the pool team jet washed the pool area and didn't bother to lift the heavy sunbeds but just scraped them across the floor.  Both of these examples seemed to illustrate just a lack of management fore-thought and eye for detail .Very disappointing.  To be fair the management team did re-act and refunded 2 nights of room charge and provided a complimentary dinner. But we would rather have had a relaxing time.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,coops9999 wrote a review May 2012,40,Good hotel....may even be a great hotel one day,"We stayed for five nights in May - very hot (41C).    The hotel is on the whole very good with some minor issues that were dealt with in one of the most professional reactions I have seen from a hotel and it's management team.    Pros:  * Very well designed  * Gardens are superb for a hotel open less than a year  * Excellent beds - as with all FS hotels  * Breakfast is fairly limited compared to Dubai and SE Asian 5* hotels but sometimes less is more - the fruit was delicious and the omlettes to order very tasty. The milk seemed to be UHT so we switched to espressos - as many as you can handle!  * Great staff - genuinely friendly and aimed to please  * Superb pool area (adults and kids pools both brilliant and brilliantly separate)  * Transfer and immigration clearance was slick  * Free shuttles to local restuarants whilst busy is actually a Mercedes and driver is there's just two of you - a nice touch  * Pool service was good  * Good management - Nick the GM was a good guy  * Saria the concierge was excellent - good suggestions and left printed notes confirming what she had booked - very helpful.    Cons:  * Checking in took too long for a hotel at <50% occupancy - lot's of people saying hello and shaking your hand etc. - they should really work out a way to do the check in formalities IN the room itself  * Room service/turn-down was a bit of a farce. Example: If you called to say ""can you do this later whilst we we are out?"" the response was ""are you refusing the turn-down service?"" Er no not exactly......  * Mini-bar not re-stocked with beer and/or glasses  * Asked for extra coat-hangers - took 2 days  * Dirty cups/plates left outside room for two days...  * Laundry shrank two of my wife's tops.......I could go on but it's more important to comment that although it took a few times to get the message across when it hit Nick the GM - they really were very serious at addressing our concerns. This was highly appreciated and shows the general ethos is one of ""Let's do this better""....  * Check out was a bit of a palava  * Some of the lunch food isn't great - and at €20 for a salad which wasn't that fresh or good the need to sharpen up. That said the grilled chicken (it was actually fried which why it tasted so good!) was slightly addictive.  * Club sandwich at room service - that benchmark of a 5* hotel - was also average.    However the pros totally outweighed the teething problems with service. We had a great time and if you go in warm/hot weather the pool is simply a lovely place to hang out do laps and catch some rays.    The staff and the personality of the staff make it hard not to like this place. Add this to the great sunny climate a 3 1/2 hour flight and a GMT timezone - this hotel and Marrakech itself is a wicked place for a long weekend.    In time this could be a real ripper of a hotel. They must remember that some of the rooms are the same cost as an Aman resort and the service needs to up a notch - maybe not in friendliness - but in efficiency and competency.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,SWIFTYS wrote a review May 2012,20,"More Faulty towers, than Four Seasons........",We were booked to stay 7 nights in a Deluxe room. We arrived late evening and checked in there were no cold towels or refreshments offered during this process which is unusual for a Four Seasons. The hotel was only 20% occupied and we asked if we could pay for an upgrade to a Pavillion room we were told that these rooms were for families and very noisy.    So we were shown to our room to say we were underwhelmed is an understatement the view from the room was what looked like a car park This is very mean spirited of the Hotel when it was so empty. So we called down and said we wanted to move rooms. After a 20 minute wait someone came to show us some other rooms. We ended up paying for an upgrade to a Pavillion Room it was not offered as a good will gesture despite us being unhappy with the room they allocated to us.    ROOMS: Air Con didnt work Wi-fi didnt work Hooks broken in bathroom picture damaged etc. House keeping inconsistant. Rooms were very clean but service was hit & Miss some days you got water some days you didnt shower gel wasnt refreshed Turn down service was luck of the draw! Beds however were amazing very comfortable.    Cabana's: My husband pre-booked a Full Service Cabana by the pool for my Birthday. They looked great on the hotels web site! The Concierge confirmed that this was all booked for us. The morning of my Birthday we called down to the Concierge and she said just to go down to the pool and see the attendant. We couldnt wait. However the reality is there is no full service cabana - its not a service that this Four Seasons offers! It shouldnt even be advertised on the Hotels Web site! Why on earth did the Concierge confirm thisTWICE !!!!!    UPGRADE: The Resort manager decided to upgrade us to a Suite as we had experienced so many problems we were told to report to Reception after Breakfast which we duly did. The Night Manager told us Yes Our suite would be ready in FIVE minutes. Wow pretty good! We went to pack. One hour later we called down to Reception as no one had come to move us we were informed it would at least another hour! We were waiting to go out that morning so we had to lock our valuables in the safe at Reception. I Complained to the Night Manager that he should have been honest with us in first place as would have been happy to move later that afternoon but instead he told us it would be five minutes. Why do that? WHATS WORSE? The Night Manager LIED to the Resort Manager and said that I had complained and gone mad as I had been kept waiting for Ten Minutes!!!!! DISGRACEFUL. The Executive suite however was lovely and they even gave us Champagne and a birthday Cake. For which we were very grateful.    FOOD & BEVERAGE; Breakfast is Excellent. Otherwise there is a lack of food choice here. The Solano is open 2 nights a week and the food is horrid bland and greasy. An Insult to Morrocan Cuisine. Bleu D'Orange is open the rest of the week and whilst the food is nice its very expensive  for what it is. Lunch at the Pool bar the menu is limited and boring. It never changes Its way overpriced as well. You are forced to eat out really. The Staff at the Pool Bar are delightful really friendly and lovely. Best thing about the hotel: Pool Attendants and Bar Staff!    ZEST BAR; Zest Bar have a VERY loud disco at weekends that goes on well into the early hours of the morning and lots of guests who were located near there didnt sleep that night at all. It wasnt advertised for the hotel guests it appeared to be geared towards locals. This is going to be a regular weekend thing so we hear... Hardly Four Seasons standards! More 18 to 30!    We cut our stay short and left 2 days early as this was probably one of the most stressful holidays we had encountered. You really dont expect this when booking a four Seasons do you? The Managements excuse? its a new hotel you get tired of hearing this! The hotel has been open for NINE months now.  Middle Management seem to care little for whats actually happening at this hotel the only way to get any kind of response is to speak to the Resort Manager Nick who seems to get things done.  Oh and a final tip leave lots of time to check out as the bill will probably be incorrect as well!  We are well seasoned travellers and cant express our disappointment enough at this Hotel.  They gave us one night free as compensation- LOL.. We now feel like we need a holiday to recover!  ( We havent just come back to moan on Trip Advisor we took up all of the above with Management during our stay but felt we had to give an honest account as this is an expensive holiday at a premium resort)    If they get all of the problems sorted outand offer a lot more food options it may eventually be good place to stay.,Date of stay: April 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Leicestershire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SWIFTYS

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Global LuxuryTraveller wrote a review Apr 2012,40,A relaxing and luxurious Oasis but still with some growing pains,We stayed at the Four Seasons (FS ) for several nights during April as a Family - First of all I would strongly recommend the Hotel to others - that said there are quite a lot of small issues that add up to a signifcant need for improvement compared to other FS we have stayed at globally and these comments are intended to be helpful to other guests and please do not let them put you off the Hotel - it is great ! You will see that the room rates are on the upper level of what FS generally charges ( eg we have several times stayed in FS in USA for sub $ 200 per basic roomnet of taxes) We are like others happy to pay 3 times that - but the increased quality and upside of so doing - We left feeling we had a good holiday but it actually wasnt really good value for money - it was good - yes - and the other aspects of the hotel made up for it - But like most - within reason - however rich you are ! - you still want to feel you are getting fair value. The Staff were generally VERY friendly and helpful - we did notice a lack of visible middle management (perhaps important in a new hotel to help train staff ? ) For example having spent days at the pool we saw no managers there - if they were there then they hid themselves and the bar and restuarant staff were left to their own devices - that said they were good generally very good - The Hotel totally lacks enough restuarants which compels guests to leave the FS - we ended up having room service some nights - or the alternative bar 2 nights per week was an Italian (with soon to be opened nightclubcigar bar) This is very expensive ( around $ 30 for a bowl of pasta with no sauce or $ 75 to 90 dependent on exchange rate for lobster linguini - very good but that price in Morrocco? Wow ! ) There is no small tapascasual cafefor evening food except for a limited menu in the bar - so if you have kids you are best currently to opt to go out for a pizza - but its added hassle and taxis are needed etc ) I really think FS have missed a trick not having a casual place for eat reasonably priced food EVERY evening - eg in the Fairmont Abu Dhabi we experienced a very good approach which was every night they held a Themed Night eg ArabianAsian etc and it was full of families and couples every night .....Also the charges for drinks and the mini bar were excessive - eg a can of tonic around $ 9 to 12 WITHOUT the gin ! This puts you off staying at the hotel bar ( no happy hours offered at all - again we believe a missed opportunity) No free water except in the Gym ! A beer by the pool (small) was $ 15 for a corona - yes i had one every day but if they were $ 10 I would have had 3 ! Who wins ? Also we had no instructions about walking about in Marrakech (no pedestrian crossing in most places ! ) FS should offer more induction for guests who are first time visitors and maybe offer tailored guides etc ? If they do - we werent told and nearly got run down in the most modern part of the City ! Also with a conference in the hotel they made the mistake of allowing 1 day the delegates to use the main restuarant to eat breakfast - this ended up with the restuarant resembling a zoo ! Staff couldnt cope and it was overwhelming ! Also the Business center is open plan with only 1 printer WITHIN the Kids play area- Not wise in my view --- eg kids being kids stay on the PCs and you cant work or print a boarding pass - Why FS did this i really dont know ! The Gym is fairly small so watch out for that - no jogging track ( i was told of ) and the Hotel lights a very nice fire in the main reception everynight unfortunately it permeates the hotel with a very unpleasant smell of smoke eg not perfume ! (There is no US style coffee cart or free coffee early AM for US folk please note ! ) There is a seperate kids pool - and as per others reviews the staff did not police this very well and they need to make sure this is adhered to..................    All in all we spent a lot of money - we had a good vacation and would go back but be careful and demand improvement were you see it is needed as this FS is ''nearly'' where it needs to be - but itsnt for the prices they charge ! It is recommended by me and family however and have a great stay !,Date of stay: April 2012,Trip type: Traveled with family,Europe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travel6Star
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Philippe P wrote a review Apr 2012,40,Romantic easter weekend in Marrocco,"We stayed at the Four Seasons this last Easter weekend and enjoyed our stay. The hotel is however not very near the city centre and getting a taxi was sometimes a bit of a wait we did get the courtesy car on one occasion. I think the hotel is possibly still very new and there are a few teething problems. When we arrived we made a cup of tea kettle very thoughtfully provided however no milk quick call and milk was delivered there should also be a small container to put the used teabag into once the tea was made. The room was very pleasant however I found it to be somewhat pricey for what it offers 700+ Euro per night. Some extra toilet paper would be nice too. The staff were friendly and helpful everywhere. The rooms cleaned nicely  The pool is great one for kids and one for adults this is very considerate however some parents were obviously not aware of the difference and nobody said anything to them. Something that was also somewhat annoying the sunbeds were just about all booked at about 10 ie.someone had placed a magazine or towel on many of them. I get really annoyed by this practice and removed a few of them only to discover they had been placed there by the lifeguard and he was getting a nice tip from some of the guests. We weren't aware of this procedure I don't agree with it even if I had been. We stayed at the pool untill about 1 o'clock and the magazines or towels were still in place in spite of numerous guests also ignorant of the ""procedure"" arriving. They all had to find themselves a place in the sun or on the sidelines.  Would I go back I don't think so.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Keith D wrote a review Apr 2012,50,Calm Oasis with Amenities,This was our first visit to Morocco and we had hoped to escape the very cold February weather in Europe. We were not disappointed by the weather at a sunny 22deg C in the day nor by this excellent hotel with well trained thoughtful staff. Marrakesh is a fascinating city with interesting insights into Arabic culture. There is a wide choice of restaurants from the pop-up ‘stalls in the square’ to high-end hotels. Guides are necessary in the Souk and some excursions are possible outside of the city preferably by private car.    The hotel is newly built to the usual 4S resort mix of hotel & properties. It has Moorish influences in large airy public spaces with cosy sitting areas with fireplaces. We stayed in room 310 a deluxe room which overlooks the gardens towards the distant Atlas Mountains. The marbled bathroom has a double sink rain shower and very large bath. Separate toilet. There is a walk in dressing with useful storage inc safe. The fittings & furniture are of high quality good heating/air conditioning large LG flat screen with wide choice of European channels DVD player and i-pod station. Tea & coffee making facilities. We slept very well in a comfortable King Bed with high quality linen and a choice of pillows.  There are two large pools one suitable for lane swimmers with adjacent hot Jacuzzi tubs. The children’s pool was unheated during our stay. Separate well fitted fitness and weights room with nearby tennis courts. Very pleasant French tennis coach. The smallish Spa under maintenance during our stay has range of massage rooms. Active Kids club. The gardens are prettily lit at night and have extensive planting of palm trees. The garden borders will need several years to mature.  The general manager maintains high standards of staff training and service. Most staff have French and English as their second languages. Whilst occasionally a lack of fluency was a problem overall we felt that all staff shared a genuine interest in the guest’s welfare and were unfailingly pleasant. The Italian and Arabic restaurants alternated service during our stay. The cooking was good especially the fish but with a limited choice of dishes. A wider menu choice including the room service menu would be helpful for children and long stay guests  We greatly enjoyed our extended stay at this hotel and recommend it unreservedly when visiting Marrakesh.,Date of stay: February 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Widley, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/London2travel
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Geoff W wrote a review Apr 2012,50,"Great hotel, wonderful trip",Just spent 5 days in Marrakech at the Four Seasons. Its an amazing hotel. While the hotel is only 8 months old the staff is incredible. Everyone knew our kids and they had fun with them - the kids loved Waffa in the lounge bar. The kids club was excellent with lots for the kids to do. Our kids loved the kids club so much they didnt want to spend time with us. Allowed us to relax at the Adult pool where Tiago (head of Restaurants) pours a deadly but delicious Caipirinha.    The spa is great. My wife went several times and I actually tried the Hammam treatment. Its local to the Morrocan culture and learned that most locals get 1x a week minimum. Was a great treatment and highly recommend if you want something very different (just be ready for the cold water ending) but traditional.    The kids loved the center of the old town with the Snake Charmers and Monkeys. We had a private guide which would highly recommend. The hotel can arrange. Give your guide an idea of what you are looking for and they will help keep things moving.    Finally a small reco: the hotel can arrange a car for pick up from the airport and return to the airport. The service helps get you thru customs without waiting in the lines. Well worth the extra cost.    Have stayed at many Four Seasons across Europe and Hawaii. This was one of my favorites due to the friendly staff.,Date of stay: April 2012,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Manhattan Beach, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeoffW_12

It was a sensational trip one not to be missed if you get the chance to go. We flew to Madrid first and stayed at the Ritz a few nights first so the flight to Morocco would not be as long.,Date of stay: March 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"JUPITER, FLORIDA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DREAMGIRLY
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,VeryDiscerning wrote a review Apr 2012,50,Truly wonderful!,This is a lovely new hotel with great staff. The grounds are superb with two huge swimming pools - use the kids' one if you want real peace and quiet as it is not heated so all the kids and parents go to the adult one!  Rooms are spacious and very well kitted out. The restaurant is a bit limited though - room service has a much better menu. The spa and gym are great.  My only criticism is that the waiters' idea of a glass of wine is a bit varied - from generous to positively mean!  It is definitely an oasis of calm and quality but not of course representative of the country or city in which it sits.,Date of stay: March 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VeryDiscerning
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,MAC_CAM_10 wrote a review Apr 2012,10,"Wait ""Four Seasons"" to get a reply.....","I contacted the Four Seasons hotel directly to get details of their Spa treatments. On reciept of their reply I decided to book directly with them(710Euro per night per room). I was advised to give CC details name e.t.c which I did and I requested confirmation of my booking when it was made.    After not hearing for a few days I sent another emailing chasing up and still no reply. After another chase up I assumed they either cant be bothered or as it was a new hotel they were having teething problems. I then sent a very strong email cancelling any booking which they might have made for me. I susequently booked the Royal Monsur as I never heard back from the Four Seasons Marrakech.    After I sent the very strong email cancelling a booking (if indeed they had actually made one!!) I recieve a reply from their Reservations Manager appologising for not repling to my emails and offering to upgrade my room which was a generous offer but when you are spending 710Euro per night will 50Euro upgrade make a difference to you? What hotels such as this Four Seasons Marrakech dont realise it is not about the money it is about providing the ""SERVICE"" right from the start.    My deal with Royal Monsur will incurr a 600Euro cancellation charge and as such I wrote back to this ""Reservations Manager"" confirming this and advising if they would deduct this cnacellation charge I would be willing to book at their hotel. I aksed them to confirm one way or the other however a week has passed by and no reply!! Being a relatively new hotel part of me was tempted to go and stay out of curiosity.    Would I stay at any Four Seasons based on this experience...definately NOT! If they had got it right the first time my booking would have been made at the price quoted inittially 710Euro...no need for an upgrade ...no need for me to book else where....however first impressions count and excuse the pun ""have to wait for Four Seasons to pass before you get a reply"" is what comes to mind if ever theis brand name is mentioned.

The Place Djemaa El-Fna is fascinating by day and an indescribable cullinary experience by night.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,MDR wrote a review Mar 2012,50,Beautiful resort for luxurious relaxing!,Let’s face it if you are going to be staying in a Four Seasons you will expect the best the hotelier world has to offer. This new Four Seasons is stunning! It seamlessly combines the luxury of a 5 star resort with a gorgeous place to relax. If coming to Marrakech you have lots of choose from (including amazing Riads the chi chi La Mamounia and glamorous/glitzy Royal Mansour) but if you want a stunning place to relax in luxury with laid back totally personable staff then choose the Four Seasons as you won’t be disappointed. Keep in mind this is a new hotel so the grounds are youthful and the staff are getting into their 5 star service promise but the eagerness and personality of the people here will delight you. If used to a Four Seasons rate card you will find this place very good value for money!

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,mkalen1 wrote a review Mar 2012,50,Best of All Worlds,The Four Seasons Marrakesh is a top resort that is located 2 miles from the medina it offers close proximity to everything in Marrakesh without the noise of the other top hotels in the city. The grounds are beautifully maintained the staff is friendly and attentive and the services (spa tennis gym pool and restaurants) are all excellent.    The spa offers traditional 'Hammam' which is essentially a Turkish bath and full body scrub experience that is a must when you visit Morroco. You will feel pampered exhilarated as relaxed all at once. At the Four Seasons it is 100% traditional and without the risk of doing it at a public spa where you will feel somewhat intimidated by the experience. Ask for Hamzah he is excellent and his English is very good and he will teach you about the history of the Hammam. One of the true highlights of the trip.    The hotel can arrange everything for you at reasonable prices. Taxis dinner reservations tours shows etc are at your fingertips with one call to their converge desk. The hotel manager Nick is excellent and made our dinner recommendation and reservation for us. The restaurants in Marrakash know the Four Seasons and will generally treat you a little 'extra special' when they know you are staying there.    The hotel also has little details that will make your stay enjoyable. Things like: live Morrocan music in the lobby traditional mint tea served throughout the day dates and nuts served throughout the day free health drinks poolside and even courtesy suntan lotion provided at the pool. It's these ltlittle things in addition to the rest that makes this hotel so special.    This entire experience is a must for international travelers.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,alistofgorillas wrote a review Mar 2012,50,I loved it here,We decided to fly to Morocco for a few days of sun after a really cold spell in our home country in Europe. No one in the family had ever been to Morocco before but I had been reading for years that it was a culturally vibrant city and that it was definitely not to be missed. However we like to be comfortable and I wasn't feeling very adventurous for this holiday - I just wanted to sit in the sun read my book and take a tour from a private guide in order to see something of a city I knew I would be too nervous to navigate on my own.  I used TA to see what others had experienced and I narrowed my choices down to either the Four Seasons La Mamounia or Kasbah Tamadot. It was also my birthday and I wanted to be treated really well not to mention stay in a beautiful 5* atmosphere.  I was a bit worried because the FS hotel was new and La Mamounia is historic - but I was turned off by one reviewer talking about cigar smoke smell and über-expensive prices so chose Four Seasons as it was closer to the medina than Tamadot.  I feel that for me and my family it was the right choice. The hotel is just amazing: it is brand spanking new and everything is perfect. I also love the staff uniforms. The air smells of orange blossoms when you walk in and there are fountains everywhere. I do agree that landscaping needs time to grow in but once that is done this place will be truly private and special.  My family and I stayed in the second best room in the hotel and I have to say it was really great. It was HUGE totally tastefully designed and my husband could work in peace while we hung out in other areas. I loved the bathrooms with the quasi-hammam shower area and the super giant bathtub.  The Italian restaurant was delicious and gorgeous but the food did take some time to come. As we were a bit tired after arrival this wasn't ideal but it wasn't that bad.  The breakfast restaurant is also lovely and a great way to greet the day with sunshine pouring in through the windows.  My husband and I had drinks one evening in the library which was also nice.  It was still a bit too cold to use the pool for us (although I did see people using it happily) so I can't say anything about that except that the pool is beautiful and heated (I heard); the pool bar/restaurant was next to it but left enough privacy that swimmers don't feel examined by patrons of the restaurant. Service here was also a bit on the slow side but the people who work here are really just wonderful.  Everyone I came across at this hotel was professional nice helpful and sincere. I worked a lot with the concierge to organize tours of the medina a neighboring beach town and a sunrise balloon ride and they were just so lovely I highly recommend using them to help organize unforgettable events. We didn't bring proper clothes for the balloon ride so they even lent us Four Seasons jackets!  I had ordered a birthday cake for my special day and it was delicious and beautiful and the hotel comped us a bottle of champagne and I also received a small gift when we checked out - how nice!  All in all I would say that I would definitely visit this hotel again - it came number one on all my criteria for a great vacation stay and Marrakech itself is a vibrant interesting city to see at least once in your lifetime.,Date of stay: February 2012,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Küsnacht, Switzerland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alistofgorillas

Each has a nice terrace with view over the gardens.    We liked very much the bar and its lounge in the lobby area. You can have lunch and also dine there. They offer Moroccan and international food. Try the pool grill at the adults-only swimming-pool too. Worth it!    My husband and I had 2 massages at the spa. Very relaxing and professional.    The resort is a family-friendly one: a family swimming-pool a kids' club a young adult club. Couples can relax at the adults-only swimming-pool in the gardens at the spa.

A car then takes you in 10 minutes to a beautiful hotel. Once there you feel so well looked after as if it is their only wish that you are happy and getting exactly what you want from your stay. This was apparent right through the hotel from the charming english manager to all the staff.  The hotel grounds and pool are beautiful. The bed so comfortable. In fact just what you would expect from a world class hotel.  A courtesy car in the evening takes you to restaurants. We went twice to maison arabe it was so good.  Maybe we were lucky but we had four days of sunshine in January and were able to have breakfast outside and enjoy sitting out.

We consider ourselves to be well-travelled having stayed at some of most recognised hotels in Asia Europe and the Americas (including other Four Seasons establishments) and the Four Seasons in Marrakech is right up there with the very very best.    The location of the hotel is ideal close enough to the old city of Marrakech for quick and easy access yet just far enough away to provide an oasis of peace and quiet after spending the day touring the palaces gardens and sights and haggling over whatever takes your fancy in the souks. The hotel buildings are designed to mirror the local architecture the gardens are huge and beautifully maintained the two swimming pools are enormous the furnishings and artwork in the common parts of the hotel are stunning and the bedrooms and bathrooms are luxurious.    But what really makes this hotel one of the very best is the quality and attitude of the hotel staff.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Northexplorer wrote a review Dec 2011,50,5* treatment for parents and kids,"We spent 5 nights in 4S Marrakech as a pre-Christmas break. The travelling party included 2 adults and 2 small children. We got upgraded to Deluxe Suite due to some issues with the booking which provided for an excellent start even before we arrived.    1. Location & grounds  The hotel is based west of the Medina and it takes ~3-5min to reach the walls by car probably 20min+ walk so it's not exactly central and there is not much around the hotel to see. May not be ideal if you travel with small kids and hope to walk straight into where all the action is but it takes virtually no time to get a taxi plus in the evenings the hotel offers courtesy rides to a venue of your choice (great for dinner transport). The hotel itself is brand new with decor and grounds trimmed to an excellent standard. The building(s) are max 3-floors and spreads wide into the gardens where there are several facilities - pools lunchtime restaurant kids club etc. The gardens are beautiful with lots of plants and decorations to explore  2. Reception and service  4S Marrakech gets the highest marks. All the staff without exception is very helpful professional and keen to serve (without overdoing it). This goes for the reception staff through concierge (Jinan was particularly helpful there) restaurant staff kids club youngsters centre room service valet... everyone. The whole family was consistently referred to by our name kids on first-name basis. Despite the hotel running for only a few months everything was outstanding by general standards and there were only rare occassions where we could think of a slight improvement within the 4S standards. Greatly impressed nevertheless.  3. Room  The suite was excellent - 4-poster bed fold-out sofa bed in the living room and a cot in the master bedroom provided for quality sleep. All rooms generously sized great terrace overlooking the gardens with Atlas mountains on the horizon plenty of storage and quality throughout (it's 4S after all!) including L'Occitane toiletries. Bose multimedia system in the living room was a nice enhancer (though UK DVDs sometimes played in faded colours due to the region issue). The only issue to point out in the room was the noisy LG DVD player in the master bedroom emitting high-pitch noise when switched off - we had to unplug it from power to stop it.  4. Food  To start with refreshments and sweets provided for kids on arrival in the room were a great welcome. Daily supply of fresh fruit and evening light snack added to the feeling of getting excellent treatment. The evening snacks were so delicious that we started really looking forward to them before heading out for the proper dinner. Out of the hotel dining facilities aside from the daily breakfast we only tried the evening restaurant Solano (twice) as the other venue is not open yet. Back to breakfast: fruit pastries and healthy breakfast bufet coupled with made-to-order omelettes did a good job every day. Cheese selection and salamis/ham were provided on some days but we usually had to ask for them as they were not on display - no issue at all though wondered why not offer upfront (perhaps because it's less healthy than what's on display:). Nothing was an issue - coffees made to order bowl of raspberries... without any extra charges. Everything is very children friendly - always provided with kids cutlery high chair and got the ""bib cleaning service"" automatically offered at the end. Great start of the day. Dinners: Great menu offering a combination of modern international and Moroccan dishes. Had 3-course dinner including a glass of wine twice which came to £100 (kids under 5 eat free btw) which we found reasonable given the food quality service provided and 4S brand. Definitely plan to eat here on one evening at least. We ate out on 3 evenings - Mamounia Moroccan Maison Arabe and Dar Yacout. 4S definitely fully comparable in terms of dining experience (perhaps just slightly behind Mamounia which was the top experience but double the price) though the environment and decor whilst great in themselves were somewhat behind the other places also due to the lack of entertainment. However 4S provides for the complimentary arrival in style to any dining destination (courtesy car - they have Range Rovers S Class Merc and Merc vans) Btw don't go to Dar Yacout with children they are awkward around them don't have high chairs and there is no menu as there is one set of courses for all (kids not charged to add silver lining).  5. Facilities  Unfortunately did not have a chance to try out much around the hotel as we spent most of the time outside. Outdoor pools looked very inviting one being heated so could have been a nice swim. Young adult centre provided good entertainment even for our little ones - mainly around the pool table with the staff helpful enough to occassionaly facilitate the game and entertaining one of the kids when I had my hands full with the other one. The centre was well equipped with video games DVD collection with big-screen ""cinema"" and outdoor chill-out and basketball area. The kids club was similarly positive experience though closing at 5pm meant that we only tried it once on our last day as pre-dinner time had to be spent in young adult centre. Perhaps worth extending the kids club opening hours there to cover for pre-dinner time so that younger children can be taken somewhere by the parents without potentially distracting others in the more grown-up centre (we had no issues but can imagine so if it gets more busy with younger guests).    Summary: Really impressed. Five stars throughout. Great care taken of the kids.

The rooms are really spacious with a walk in dressing room and lovely large bathroom. The bath was one of the best I have ever experience really deep but didn't take long to fill. The beds were beautiful and quality of the linen exceptional. All rooms have a balcony with a couple of chairs and table and a cute little day bed area. One of the best things are the swimming pools - there is a large adult only one and also a large family pool far enough away from each other to be peaceful.

The cabanas are comfortable and you are bought chilled juices and fruits from time to time. There is a great young persons room with pool able computer games pcs and a cinema.    The spa massage was lovely and relaxing in a clean friendly environment.    The best thing about the hotel without question is the staff. They are without exception the best we have ever come across. Nothing is too much trouble and they all have a smile whatever time of day.    We can not recommend this hotel enough.,Date of stay: November 2011,,Chichester,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bevldavies
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Anonymous8 wrote a review Nov 2011,40,Very Close to Perfection,"Stayed at the FS Marrakech in mid-October for a total of 5 nights. As the other reviewers noted arranged for the meet and greet service at the airport which was very convenient and pleasant. The hotel is a quick 15 minute ride from the airport and it is a beautifully designed and landscaped resort. The rooms are spacious and well appointed. The hotel amenities are wonderful - the gym the pools and the spa. Had breakfast (ala carte) at the hotel everyday and had lunch at the grill once. They also provide a complimentary car service to the medina or within the city limits in the evenings.    As the hotel is still new they are probably undergoing some ""growing pains"". There were a couple of minor incidents but the major issue was the failure of the room air-conditioning to work in the middle of the night. This happened to me on two consecutive evenings when it was very warm outside. However hotel management apologized profusely and made accommodations to remedy the situation. Instead of being disgruntled I was very impressed with their ""service recovery"".    Overall this is a great hotel and I enjoyed my stay tremendously. The passion of the staff is the best part of my stay! I do not know how FS manages to do it at all their hotels - but I am impressed with the staff who were very warm genuine and always ready to help with a smile!

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,nyctraveljunkies wrote a review Nov 2011,50,Four Seasons Marrakech: An Oasis,We loved our stay at this hotel. The staff (manager junior manager and concierge team) were all very welcoming and helpful throughout our stay. The rooms grounds and pools are beautiful quiet and relaxing. We enjoyed the fresh fruit placed in the room each day. We only ate at the hotel for breakfast but the breakfast buffet was very good.    The hotel offers many interesting day trips outside Marrakech. We did a day trip to a Berber village in the Atlas mountains. There we made tagine in the home of a villager and were given a tour of the village and a brief ride on a donkey. Learning about life in the village and spending time in someone's home was a very unique experience. One of the reasons we stayed at the Four Seasons was because this excursion is exclusive to the hotel because of their affiliation with the tour company. Our tour guide was a lovely woman who was very easy to talk to and very attentive to our questions and needs throughout the day.    The concierge was helpful in arranging a last-minute excursion to ride camels in an area outside of the city.    The concierge made recommendations and reservations at two excellent restaurants for dinner: Dar Al Yacout and Al Fassia.    We went to the souks by ourselves one evening and did not have any problems.    We highly recommend the VIP airport service. When we arrived they took us to a waiting area and processed our paperwork so we could avoid waiting in line. Upon departure they processed our check-in and other paperwork and took us to the front of the security and boarding lines. It was a seamless process. The hotel is just minutes from the airport.    We enjoyed seeing Marrakech and will definitely stay at the Four Seasons in the future since we had such a memorable experience.,Date of stay: October 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"New York City, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nyctraveljunkies
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,ZioL B wrote a review Nov 2011,40,Marrakech - special for families,"I stayed at the Four Seasons just a week ago.  The property is centrally located but you need a taxi to reach the city centre (Jmaa El Fna Square). The location is therfore quiet and relaxing but in the easy reach of the vibrant centre of Marrakech.  Rooms are minimal chic with arabic touches.  Public areas are fantastic: 2 pools one for families. Care to youngsters is extreme - two different areas for the very young kids and the ""grown-up"".  The Arab/Italian offers gourmet cuisine.  Service considering the country is good with some excellence in Child care and Reception  SPA and fitness are very good. Overall a very positive experience and I would suggest it if you are travelling with your family.",Date of stay: November 2011,Trip type: Traveled solo,roma,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ZioLB
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,kittyhola wrote a review Nov 2011,50,Absolute Luxury and Top Notch Service,I booked this hotel for a 3 night break at the start of the October half term for me and my husband and our teen daughters aged 14 and 13. As we have been to Marrakech several times before I was looking for a luxurious hotel for us to spend the majority of out time at. The Four Seasons did not disappoint! With it being newly opened I based my decision to book on the very consistent reviews here and the facilities on offer although I do feel their website does not do them justice and really doesn't show the hotel off as well as it could. I did mention this and I have taken lots of photos which I will upload. So......    We booked the transfer from the airport which is around £55 for which we were whizzed straight into a VIP lounge (basic but the sentiment was there) whilst our passports were taken away to be checked allowing us to then walk straight through passport control to the carousel. We were then transported tothe hotel in a very luxurious and immaculatey clean car. On arrival at the hotel we were taken straight to a lounge and served complimentary drinks whilst check in took place. We were upgraded to 2 interconnecting premium rooms. The rooms were fabulous - the bed was so comfortable. Fabulous marbled bathroom - lovely balcony with an alcoved seating area. We both feel this is one of the best rooms and hotels we have ever stayed in. The service throughout was impeccable - we were treated like royalty and yet the atmosphere was totally relaxed and informal. Sometimes hotels of this class can seem very stuffy and full of rules but here the staff were just happy to look after us and give us a fantastic time. The teen room is very well equipped with apple macs wiis etc and even has a cinema My criticism here is that they let younger children in too which doesn't appeal to teenagers who like their own space. The two pool areas are beautiful and there are luxurious sun beds and cabanas. Lovely poolside nibbles such as frozen water melon on sticks appear at random intervals. The water wasn't very warm but neither was the weather but it didn't stop the hardy Brits enjoying their half term! As the weather wasn't perfect my husband and I spent quite a bit of time in the spa. Again this is a wonderful facility brand new and here's that word again-luxurious. I was disappointed that the jacuzzi wasn't warm but I think like the outdoor pools this is just teething troubles! I had two massages - both very relaxing. My husband was very impressed with the sauna in the men's spa. The gym is fully equipped but very few people were in there. There is a choice of 3 restaurants on site currently - we felt the menus were a little limited and the food is pricey but nice and the service of course was excellent. Breakfasts were excellent and could really see you through until late afternoon - there was more or less anything on offer. The bar was very expensive- charging between £8 - 10 for a bottle of beer! The hotel is a short ten minute taxi ride from the airport and the medina so.    We loved the four seasons and had a thoroughly relaxed and indulgent break. Make no mistake it's a pricey option but if you go with this in mind you won't be disappointed. We will definitely be returning.,Date of stay: October 2011,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Wirral,England",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kittyhola
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,travellerecosse wrote a review Nov 2011,40,This Hotel Will be Excellent,This hotel only opened in June and the management have done an exceptional job getting staff trained to such an accomplished stage in a relatively short space of time.  The facilities that were opened were all to the standard you would expect at a Four Seasons.  Bedrooms are comfortable and quiet with a good supply of amenities.  Restaurant was good for breakfast. Choice was not huge but I am sure this will change as the Hotel approaches its expected levels of occupancy. Standard of food at dinner was very good and the wine list reasonable if just little expensive. This may be due to local taxes but it had the most expensive Chateau Lynch Bagee I have seen.  Public areas are very well decorated in a Morrocan/modern theme.  Where the hotel excels is in the positive and helpful attitude of all of the staff. They are clearly a group of people who not only take pride in their work but also appear to enjoy it. Staff attitude is what makes good hotels great and if the level of service is at least maintained this will be a great hotel.,Date of stay: October 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travellerecosse
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Mark B wrote a review Oct 2011,50,Marvellous Marrakech,My family and I stayed at the Four Seasons Marrakech late October 2011. We are two adults a teenager and a toddler. From start to finish this was a fantastic experience. Whilst Marrakech itself is a fabulous destination recommended to all for the sensory overload that it delivers the actual Four Seasons hotel is the subject of this brief review.    In summary we all loved it. Outstanding staff were friendly willing and provided excellent service without ever appearing over the top. Food choice was good and value was more than ok. Hotel grounds pools spa etc were all fantastic clean and relaxing. Our room (a deluxe pavilion) was particularly nice easily capable of accommodating the whole family and maintaining a degree of separation. We even had our own plunge pool.    Downsides were almost zero. Perhaps the pools were a little cold? Apparently this is being resolved (the hotel is quite new and I guess it takes a little while to fine tune).    Highly recommended.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,alba s wrote a review Oct 2011,50,An amazing experience!,"I stayed in the Four Seasons Resort in Marrakech with my Mother and my 4 year old son during the month of October. Four Seasons took such great care of us and it was a really memorable holiday.  I advice you to hire the ""Meet and greet"" service both for your arrival as for your departure. There is someone from the hotel waiting for you when you get off the plane he escorts you to a VIP area while they take care of all your passport controls and then take you directly to a comfy air conditioned Jeep (the taxis available at the airport arent excatly screaming comfort!)  Once we arrived at the hotel it was like a dream the decoration throughout and the gardens are maginificent. We were able to check in at the terrace whilst enjoying a cold drink this was much appreciated. We booked an executive suite but as the hotel was not very full we received a complimentary upgrade. The rooms are decorated beautifully and from our room we had direct access to the family pool which was great.  If travelling with kids this is a great place to stay the family pool is fantastic for them to be able to have fun without worrying about bothering those guests without children. They also have a great Kids Club program run by the wonderful Myriam.  The food is so good we ate lunch and dinner in the hotel everyday and it was a great mix of typical food from the area as well as classic bistro dishes. The menus for children are also great!  All in all I can say that the whole trip was amazing. The room prices are high but the beauty of the resort and the quality of the service provided by all the staff makes it very worth it!

Eventually we were picked up but this spoilt the first part of our stay.Secondly there are only two restaurants open the rooftop terrace bar is closed until 2012..The pool is amazing the staff friendly and attentive as with all FS hotels and the Spa was nice but could use some improvement as all treatments were not as expected. I'm sure this will be a fabulous place next year however overall we had a lovely relaxing time here and will return.,Date of stay: October 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Leicester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DarrenV659
Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,jamsa90 wrote a review Oct 2011,40,Excellent,"A long weekend in Marrakech at the newly opened Four Seasons.    We were there not long after the hotel had been fully opened to the public (it was soft-opened in July this year).    Room was excellent - nice size good view from the balcony large bathroom and bath with separate shower dressing room and a huge and incredibly comfortable bed.    We could not fault the friendliness and attentiveness of the staff - each one of them stopped to say hello as you passed them in the corridors or the grounds unfalteringly smiling and polite.    Food at both restaurants we ate at (on the terrace and by the pool) was excellent and though expensive (the price of food and drinks are what you would expect of a 5* resort hotel) was plentiful and generous. Breakfast selection was also excellent.    Two swimming pools - one a ""family pool"" and one more conventional (and much quieter - I felt bad disturbing the peach by swimming around!) both with very comfortable beds and wonderful staff circulating occasionally with a small drink or selection of fruit (complimentary).    My wife and I had both had a hammam at the Spa on the evening of our first night - an incredible experience I would highly recommend. My wife enjoyed hers although less so when she heard how good mine had been! Chaps - I highly recommend this experience not for the faint hearted but you will feel revived refreshed and sparkling afterwards mentally and physically (and you may have also learned a little about Moroccan culture and traditions).    The only gripe I would make is the transfers from the airport. Owing to a slight error on the hotel's part our car was not there to greet us and we only by chance happened upon another member of the Four Seasons staff who sorted this for us. Still it was about 30 minutes after we exited customs before we were on the way to the hotel. While the car was beautiful the drive smooth and cool and with cold towels on arrival at the car I did not feel at 550dh (about £55) it was good value for money (and that notwithstanding the lateness). It is less than 10 minutes from the airport to the hotel and for that distance I'd have been happy in a local taxi (which are a fun experience in themselves!) - for that be ready to barter and don't pay more than 100dh if possible.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,kt44did wrote a review Sep 2011,40,Opulent Oasis,"Stayed here for work and was treated like royalty. This could be due to the fact that I was one of maybe 40 people in the hotel. Give them business so it can stick around! It's simply decorated with light beige color tones which gives the whole resort a feeling of tranquility. Perfect for those wanting to escape the sometimes overwhelming Medina. This resort is certainly more for the honeymooning couple or for family. Immaculately landscaped gardens with two pools - one adult one and one for kids. You do need to be specific about the ""Do Not Disturb"" sign though as the maids came in anyway. I didn't mind so much because they would also leave different food treats every day when I got back to my room. The staff here are all so nice and accommodating willing to cater to your every need. I only didn't give it 5 stars yet because it's fairly new with some kinks to work out (i.e. the do not disturb sign; another day they didn't have their breakfast buffet when I was expecting to grab something quick on my way out but since they didn't have enough people in the hotel they didn't want to waste food - fair enough reason just wish I was made aware beforehand). The spa services there were great - had a wonderful Marrakech massage. The restaurant has delicious Moroccan food but if you try to stray towards the Italian side of the menu you'll be a bit disappointed. The seafood salads though are amazing - ones with shrimp and calamari.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,inunez wrote a review Aug 2011,50,Highly recommended,Me and my family spent a 5 day weekend on August 2011. Overall satisfaction was very high to the point that it was my family's first time at a Four Seasons Hotel and they have declared themselves Four Seasons fans.  The Four Seasons Marrakech is a brand new hotel which is overall great but can still bring around one or two very minor drawbacks (i.e. the free dvds at the Young Adult Clud did not work in my rooms DVD player because they were purchased at different regions). The special room @ around 600 EUR is large enough has a patio and the best bed I have experienced so far (much better than Westin's heavenly bed). The place is quiet the service is young extremely friendly and detail oriented. They speak Moroccan Arabic English and French. However as soon as they knew we were Spanish there was a Spanish speaking person waiting to receive us at the door and show us the hotel as the staff helped us unload our baggage and provided cool towels to alleviate the heat. The hotel's decoration is elegant with touches of moroccan decor and a nice use of fountains to improve looks and temperature. The swimming pools are elegant nice and large as are the hot tubs. Temperature of the water was around 28 degrees centigrade which was perfect on a typical hot day as those in Marrakesh. The hotel also has a decent gym (brand new) and clay tennis courts. The breakfast was included and the quality and variety were excellent (to begin with ingredients in Morocco are better than ingredients in the US). The food was good suitable for foodies (and I am extremely exigent for this) but probably there is still a bit of room for perfection in the Four Season's Kitchen. In addition you may not want to order hamburguers (halal meat tastes different and they may not be ready on time because they are not precisely a staple food in Morocco) and focus more on local dishes. Local wine selection was definitely good (and cheap) but the international wine menu was still limited (from a wine lover standard). Overall the food quality is high and the eating experience pleasant.  They had three out of four restaurants open and we only experienced two of them so my review may not be truly comprehensive here. I also would like to point out that during our stay the hotel was not fully operational (only forty rooms were available of a total a hundred and fourty more or less) and therefore in a process of fine tuning. Despite all the experience was flawless the service amazing (I recommend the VIP transfer service from the airport) the facilities top notch and the food great.

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,iaia852 wrote a review Jul 2011,50,Best experience we've ever had - couldn't be better,My family and I took a trip to Morocco for the first time in July 2011. Because it was our first time we did not what to expect but as I now reflect on our trip I realize it could not have been better and the Four Seasons Marrakech was a big part of that.    As we arrived in the Marrakech Airport we were greeted by a special service the Four Seasons had set up for us. I highly recommend that you ask the concierge about it before you arrive. We were put in a lounge for an outstanding check-in service. The hospitality was great. Our van was waiting for us right outside and in less than 10 minutes we were at the hotel. The same type of service is offered back on the way home --definitely highly recommended!    The reception and service at the Four Seasons Marrakech is impeccable. Make sure to meet Driz! ! I agree with other reviews that we were very well-treated. A big part of our great experience was the friendliness and hospitality of the staff. The concierge was very helpful in making our 4 days special. They recommended the best activities tour guides and restaurants/cafes. On our first day we were set up with a great tour guide who showed us around the souks. I also highly recommended going through the souks with a tour guide. We were able to find the best stores food and prices with him. And plus he provided us with important information regarding Marrakech and its people.    On our second day the concierge set up a trip to Marrakech's palaces and gardens with our driver. Visit the Jardin Majorelle it vibrates with Marrakech's colors. The next day the concierge planned a very special trip for our family. We had wanted to visit the Atlas mountains but Youssef (concierge) planned us a trip to a Berbere village followed by a camel ride to our lunch site followed by easy mountain biking in the Atlas. It was a very unique and special experience for us -- we had two 4x4 cars with drivers to the the Berbere village. There we were greeted by a tour guide called Hanane a VERY nice girl who we shall not forget. She was extremely friendly and it was obvious she loved her job. In the village we entered a typical house where they taught us how to make our own chicken tajine from stratch. Then Hanane took us outside where we mounted camels and rode for an hour to our lunch site. Suddenly in the middle of our ride we saw a brightly colored tent facing the Atlas mountains -- that was our lunch site!! And of course we ate the chicken tajine we made earlier and a lamb tajine. Our mountain bike guide ate with us along with Hanane and after lunch he took us on a ride with professional bikes. For safety our cars were right behind us. This trip is something we recommend -- make sure to ask the concierge about it!    Our last day was another great idea by the concierge. We had a wonderful tour guide Hicham who taught us much about Islam Islamic art history and culture in Marrakech. He took us to the souks the Marrakech museum and various other spots in the city. Hicham taught us some valuable things and we now have an even greater respect for Morocco its people religion and culture.    I cannot express how great our experience with the Four Seasons Marrakech was. The rooms were fantastic - there was plenty of space and most importantly they were well-treated and clean. Again the staff was the friendliest and most hospitable staff we have ever encountered. They tried to help us with everything. Definitely eat at the restaurant as well. We had various meals at the hotel and needless to say they were very good and there was a variety of food from Italian to French to traditional Moroccan. Breakfast was outside with fresh fruits and great coffee and pastries. We had green mint tea everyday at the hotel's book room. Make sure you do that! It was the best place to relax after a long day with many great reads around and plenty of space. Say hello to Hanane!    The facilities at the Four Seasons were also impeccable. The kids' teen center was quite something - plenty of brand new computers various game systems movies a cinema theater game tables and game rooms. Ghita made it extremely pleasant for our kids. They are still talking about her! The spa was also just as great - impeccable actually. We highly recommend the Thousand and One Nights treatment! The pools were equally as great...    We only have great things to say about the Four Seasons Marrakech and we hope that you will be able to experience it as well in the same light. If we had the chance we would go back right now but we will make another visit soon. It is an 11 out of 10 in our book.

I'm used to spend my week ends in Marrakech and that's clearly a standing that does not exists elsewhere in Marrakesh.    We were about 25 people and each one of us have been treated like queens and kings !  Warm reception professionalism high level of services (restaurant teen lounge bar Home cinema room 2 swimming pools excellent service in Spa fitness room...) !!    I really recommend you to explore this hotel on my side I'm going back very soon !

Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,WB1221 wrote a review Jun 2011,50,"OMG! It must be a dream....because I felt like a queen.""","Literally my husband and I were the first guests to stay at this brand new property for three nights. Four Seasons does it again by going above and beyond our expectations and continues to make my family and I to stay at Four Seasons properties world wide during our vacations. Every arrangement was handled meticulously from the Four Seasons staff in Marrakech before check in and also during our stay. The true experience starts off by getting off the plane and swept away from private security at immigration and relaxing at a VIP lounge (while our bags and passports were being cleared) and then getting driven by a chauffeur to the hotel. We were then welcomed by VERY hospitable staff members at the property. The decor of the property complements Moroccan architecture and the details could not only be seen in the common areas but also in our suite. After drinking the fresh lemonade and mint drinks ( Moroccan hospitality drink) we were escorted and given details about the property till we reached our gorgeous one bedroom suite. The suite had beautiful floral arrangements a fruit platter along with delicious dried fruit and assorted nuts platter ( all of the above foods were replenished daily during our stay). Our view overlooked the pool courtyard and the private Four Seasons residences. The spa offered an array of treatments and the ""1000 and 1 nights""- highly recommended. Our meals were flavorful and and the menus offered a great selection of worldly cuisines that we truly indulged.",Date of stay: June 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Orlando, Florida",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WB1221
