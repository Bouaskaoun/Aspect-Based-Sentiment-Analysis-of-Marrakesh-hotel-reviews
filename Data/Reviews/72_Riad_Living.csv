72 Riad Living,Ron N wrote a review Feb 2023,50,Top marks well earned,We stayed for four nights at 72 Riad Living (would have been five except my wife developed a medical issue) and were so impressed by the deep commitment and attention to detail all staff demonstrated. Whether we interacted with the bellman receptionist waiter room cleaner right up to the general manager there was no doubt that all were on the same page when it came to ensuring guest satisfaction. Kudos to Stefania and her team.  The hotel itself is a quiet oasis in the beehive that is the old medina. We were glad that the hotel provides airport pickup as there's no direct taxi access to the property. The driver must drop you at the nearest medina entrance to be met by a Riad bellman who loads your luggage in a cart and guides you through the unmarked streets. A bit confusing at first but by Day Two we were navigating with ease.  The interior courtyard(or riad which translates from the Arabic word garden) is tranquil and our room was without faults. (We particularly enjoyed our private rooftop terrace.) A very thoughtful touch was the provision of a guest cell phone pre-programmed with speed dialing to the reception desk or manager. Extremely reassuring to have in your pocket if you happened to get lost or required assistance when out touring.  Overall 72 Riad Living met all our expectations. Thanks to all; we had a lovely visit.,Date of stay: February 2023,,"Banff, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gadman

72 Riad Living,tephrash wrote a review Mar 18,50,Beautiful down to the details,Beautifully designed Riad and perfect setting to start and end every day with its tranquillity and beauty. Every turn was a beautiful surprise and we kept discovering new aesthetically designed corners no matter how many times we walk through the Riad. They're building a new wellness centre and I can already tell its going to be again beautiful. Special shoutout to the the team Sara who went out of her way to help us with carparking and making sure we got to the Riad ok. Hassan who made us feel very welcomed and at home with always a smile on his face and of course Aziz for guiding us outside the Riad.

72 Riad Living,Lucy R wrote a review Mar 8,50,Lovely 72,I recently traveled to Morocco with my 21 month old daughter and husband. Our first stop was Riad 72. We were greeted by Stefania and her wonderful team. It was a perfect start to our adventure. We enjoyed very comfortable accommodations in a wonderful location. Riad 72 is an oasis from the bustle of the medina but still very close all that the old town has to offer. The staff was very kind to our daughter. My husband and I both enjoyed wonderful massages at the spa. The food is delicious and the staff is more than willing to help with any arrangements that need to be made inside or outside of the Riad. We are grateful to the entire team. Best wishes Lucy William and Brigitte,Date of stay: February 2023,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J8421FSlucyr

Highlights were the roof top pool and lounge areas and of course the incredible spa! I had a traditional Hammam scrub followed by a massage while my husband chilled with the children by the pool it was the most blissful 2 hours and I would highly recommend it!

72 Riad Living,Stuart B wrote a review Feb 2023,50,Wonderful Riad 72 living,We went to Marrakech on a short weeks hols and decided to stay in a traditional Riad rather than a hotel - what a good decision! 72 Riad Living was wonderful - excellent location great room good views from the balcony roof terrace and superb food - both at breakfast and dinner. The staff could not have been more helpful and friendly - they helped us with excursion and meal bookings and made us feel very welcome. We also did 2 of the Riad's excursions - both had good drivers and we felt very safe. The first trip was a walk to a waterfall in the Oureka Valley which was wonderful and not too crowded in February (although the included lunch was a bit disappointing). The following day we went on the Desert Lake and Mountains day out - great sites plenty of opportunity for stunning photos and a great lunch in a location to die for! Thank you to all our drivers and guides - they were excellent. And a big thank you to the team at 72 Riad Living for their hospitality and making us feel so welcome.,Date of stay: February 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Oxshott, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/26StuartB26
72 Riad Living,Ryan M wrote a review Feb 2023,50,Great Riad!,"The 72 Riad was a fantastic place to stay while we were in Marrakesh. I can always nitpick a hotel on small issues...however the issues were so small and few that they aren't even worth mentioning. We stayed for 6 nights and overall the Riad was beautiful the rooms were clean quite and well kept. The restaurant served delicious food from breakfast to lunch to dinner. The staff was welcoming and helpful. This Riad is in the heart of the action and it might be a little ""busy"" outside of the Riad for some people. But inside is a peaceful retreat.

72 Riad Living,MicheleClement wrote a review Feb 2023,50,72 Riad Living is a gem at the heart of Marrakech,We had a wonderful stay at 72 Riad Living. It is a gem at the heart of the sights of Marrakech and yet it is so quiet. You can walk to the major sights and top restaurants.    All the staff were friendly and helpful especially Stefania who met us as soon as we arrived and gave us an invaluable map with advice on sights to visit. She also gave us a mobile phone with hotel numbers uploaded which made us feel safe and which came in very useful when one of us lost our phone!    The roof has stunning views over the City. You can watch the sunset with a drink and you can swim if weather allows. The roof is also the best place to listen to the city’s calls to prayer from multiple minarets. What an experience it is.    The hotel restaurant is excellent for all meals especially dinner. Breakfast showcases Moroccan baking.    We would highly recommend this lovely comfortable authentic small hotel. Staying here is like being a welcome guest in someone’s home.,Date of stay: January 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Wrotham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MicheleClement

72 Riad Living,UKTripAdviser wrote a review Jan 2023,50,Excellent throughout,We had a wonderful time at 72 Riad Living. The entire team were courteous professional kind and efficient from the time we sent our first enquiry to the time our luggage was loaded into the taxi on the way home. This is testament to the clearly excellent management of this relaxed and comfortable establishment.    The location – in a quiet narrow street (no cars) – is perfect for a stay in Marrakech and within walking distance of wherever you’d need to get to. (The Yves Saint Laurent museum and Jardin Majorelle – both a disappointment but see separate Tripadvisor reviews – are less than half an hour’s walk away.)    Our room had its own private roof terrace and hot tub which was a privilege. The room itself was spotlessly clean and Housekeeping’s attention to detail was impressive and greatly appreciated.    The breakfast was generous: and generously served until 11:00. Wonderful! We had the option of being served breakfast wherever we wished: On our terrace; in our room; in the dining room of our choice or on the main terrace. Relaxed and laid back.    On our first day the team booked a city guide for a few hours to show us around the main souk and to help us get our bearings. The team also provided advice and guidance on a day tour (and booked it on our behalf).    Throughout our entire stay – whether at reception in the restaurant at breakfast or on the terrace bar – we were never once asked to provide our room number. All members of the team seemed to know who we were and didn’t need to ask. This is an example of how the management’s culture works in the background to make staying at 72 Riad Living a wonderful experience.

72 Riad Living,mississippichick wrote a review Jan 2023,50,High-end boutique-like Riad in best part of Medina,We spent New Year's weekend at 72 Riad Living. Stefania was very helpful from the very beginning. We had a single room for my 78 y.o. father-in-law and they had a perfect room for us to share with our 7 y.o daughter. She had her own little separate room/bathroom inside our room. The staff/service was excellent they were helpful with recommendations. Great location in the Medina. Great food. High end accommodations. Facilitated all of our dinner reservations. Would stay there again. We went to La Mamounia for a dinner. What a zoo. So glad we didn't stay somewhere like that.

72 Riad Living,georgefrbu wrote a review Jan 2023,50,The only choice for me in Marrakech!,I've been very lucky to be able to visit many hotels around the world and 72 Riad Living has to be among my all-time top 3.    Clearly it's a stunningly beautiful hotel which manages to combine luxury with a true flavour of Moroccan architecture and decoration. While staying in a beautiful hotel can be a true pleasure in itself what makes 72 Riad Living special are the management and staff who work there.    Stefania and her team are the true definition of hospitality. Every single member of staff greets you by name and most of them know you daily itinerary ensuring that you're not late for your guide or giving you tips and tricks on how to get around in Marrakech.    It's this attention to detail - this soul - that sets 72 Riad Living apart from many larger hotels. Let's face it with enough money a hotel can create a beautiful experience but it takes dedication training and a true spirit of hospitality to create a 360-degree experience like Stefania and her team do in 72 Riad Living (and not to forget that we stayed in the Riad during one of the busiest times of the year when most hotels would have been fully stretched. You didn't feel this at all in 72 Riad Living; everyone went to extreme lengths to cater to your every need).    (While it might be clear to most I do want to point out that the hotel does not have lifts and has some steep and winding stone stairs. This is to be expected in a Riad but if you're unable to climb stairs it might not be the best location for you - or you might want to ask for a ground floor room).    When we next go to Marrakech we are definitely staying at 72 Riad Living again. I can also thoroughly recommend this hotel for anyone wishing to fully immerse themselves in Moroccan hospitality and explore the Medina. Stefania and team will help you get the most out of your stay!,Date of stay: December 2022,,"Zurich, Switzerland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/georgefrbu

72 Riad Living,Azmadeus wrote a review Dec 2022,50,A Trip to a more Elegant Time,The Medina in Marrakech is daunting movement and noise everywhere small curved alleyways signs in multiple languages I can't read. We walked down the first street following directions to the turn - it got quieter. Down that short street to the next turn and it got quieter still. Finally after another turn and not sure we're in the right place everything went really quiet.    We knocked on the door and it opened into a small nondescript hallway. Wondering if we were in the right place we followed into a beautiful four story courtyard. This is the right place how we want to live.

72 Riad Living,wigbox wrote a review Dec 2022,50,The Best Staff and Gorgeous Riad! stay here!,Our stay at 72 was most exemplary. From morning until night the staff was gracious prompt kind and went about e and beyond to make us feel welcome. We had a large room called Karma and it was so lovely with a huge skylight/cupola in the curling that they uncover in the day. The Riad is impeccable top to bottom comforting Moroccan modern and Italian design fused in harmony. There is nothing they won’t help you with. They also pick you up at the airport for no charge. Our flight came in near Midnighy so this was so appreciated esp since the Riad is a few small blocks from the public Road. They have someone waiting to take your luggage in and up. Also the food was amazing chef made us a bastilla on request and the breakfasts were bountiful.

The riad is quaint and welcoming the food was fantastic and the hammam was relaxing—- but the real star of the show was the care that all of the crew took to welcome us and make us feel at home.

72 Riad Living,Tony R wrote a review Oct 2022,50,Fantastic stay - absolute haven in the centre of Marrakech,From the moment we arrived at the Riad until the moment we left the staff at 72 looked after us. Nothing was too much trouble and the friendliness and warmth of everyone made us feel at home. Breakfasts were fabulous and we ate in the hotel for dinner during the evening and the food was superb.  We also tried the Hammam and massage which were equally a great experience. The roof terrace and pool are great for relaxing or a pre dinner aperitif.  The Riad is perfectly placed to walk to the Souks and Jemma El Fna. A real gem of tranquility right in the centre of Marrakesh. We loved it and hope to return.

72 Riad Living,Crystal G wrote a review Oct 2022,50,Heavenly Escape,Riad 72 Living is a beautiful peaceful escape from the vibrant and busy streets of Marrakesh. Stefania the longtime manager here helped us literally for years with our booking. Our original booking was sadly cancelled due to Covid and subsequent re-bookings were also cancelled due to Covid. We FINALLY made it to Morocco this year! Stefania was a kind and helpful sea of calm during all of the re-bookings. This was our first trip to Morocco and we had all sorts of questions which were promptly answered by Stefania via email before we arrived. She even helped us with our hotel in the Atlas Mountains when that hotel not answering our emails. What a gem Riad 72 has in Stefania and for that matter the rest of the very friendly and helpful staff. The Riad itself is an oasis of beauty and calm. Our room was lovely and very grand and styled in cool Moroccan furnishings. The bathroom was massive. Our balcony looked into the lush courtyard filled with tall banana trees and other greenery and a bubbling fountain. The location of Riad 72 was just perfect for us. An easy walk into the maze of the medina but we also had an easy walk to the super cool shopping area of Gueliz. There are endless cafes and restaurants and shops nearby. We didn't spend much time at the pool or the rooftop of the hotel but that was only because we were always out shopping. The rooftop has a great view and lots of different seating areas. Really nice.,Date of stay: September 2022,,san francisco,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/crystalSanFrancisco
72 Riad Living,Edmcedface wrote a review Oct 2022,50,"Luxurious, authentic & super location.",You step in to the Riad 72 from the narrow bustling streets close to the heart of the city and the peace is blissful. It is a fantastic green and tranquil contrast to the exotic chaos of the medina. The welcome from the staff and the transfer was spot on and relaxing. Throughout our stay they made us feel like we were coming home every time we came back to the Riad and we were sad to leave.    The room was spacious and cool and the bed was really comfortable. Lovely authentic styling and good finish. Nice balcony onto the internal atrium with comfortable chairs to sit in the shade and read a book or drink mint tea.    The rooftop is a proper suntrap with a newly opened plunge pool to cool off in. Plenty of space for the number of guests and frequently we had the area to ourselves. They were working on another pool area in an adjacent building while we were there which looks like it will be beautiful.    Breakfast was plentiful and we had a beautiful dinner in the riad one night.    We took advantage of the in-house Hammam and massage and both were excellent.    The narrow streets of the souks are about a 3 minute walk from the door and you can easily walk to Jemaa el- Fnaa.    I said it before but the staff were fantastic and really made it feel like home.    Would definitely stay again hopefully soon.,Date of stay: October 2022,,"Powmill, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/edmcedface

72 Riad Living,Michelle wrote a review Jun 2022,50,Make this your home in Marrakech,My friends and I loved this riad so much it was so hard to leave. It truly was a peaceful oasis in what can sometimes be an overwhelming city.    Service: After hearing some horror stories from other friends who have traveled to Marrakech my friends and I immediately felt at ease with the outstanding service that 72 Riad provided. Riad 72’s amazing service begins as soon as they pick you up from the airport. Easy to spot them outside the terminal and the driver was so welcoming. Our driver introduced us to our luggage porter I think his name was Amir? Throughout our stay he ALWAYS had a smile on his face whether we saw him at the hotel or walking in the streets. Special shout out to Khalid who served us our welcome tea breakfast and also assisted with other requests. Khalid was always available to help out and made sure no request or question was left unanswered. Khalid is an asset to the team at 72 Riad! Also shout out to Yassini who provided excellent service for us at dinner. The housekeepers always made sure we came home to a clean bed and would even leave delicious macaroons at night! It’s unfortunate we did not get every team member’s name at the riad otherwise I would name everyone we encountered. Every employee made us feel at home and made us feel like VIPs!    Location: The riad seems tucked away as it is off the main road and away from the busy action of the Medina. We were very thankful to be in a quiet and secure area because we felt very safe here. We were only 5-10 minute walk to the Medina. The taxi stand is only a 2 minute walk away from the riad.    Ambiance: The riad is beautiful. Every single detail of decor is visually pleasing. It is obvious that the space and design of the riad were meticulously planned. Our deluxe XL room was absolutely gorgeous. It was enough space for 3 of us and we appreciated having 2 bathrooms. The showers in our room had strong water pressure and perfect range of temperatures. The air conditioning was strong and much appreciated by us Americans in the heat of June so to us it didn’t matter that there was no pool compared to other riads.

The boutique hotel is just the right size not too many rooms to be anonymous not to few to be intrusive. You can find new rooms seating areas and vistas while still not getting lost. The architecture design and furnishings are elegant. However the standout aspect are the staff. They operate as a team. Kind and positive to one another. Their attention and attitude is so warm and genuine that you are literally left wondering how special these people are and how special they make you feel.

72 Riad Living,Jos H wrote a review Jun 2022,50,A fabulous oasis of calm in the energising chaos of Marrakech Medina,Our stay at 72 Road Living was a dream; from the gorgeous environment they have created to the attentive and infinitely helpful team of staff.    The hotel itself is beautiful with attention to detail displayed in every aspect of its design and setup - it is peaceful and calming with a gentle buzz in the courtyard at mealtimes - created by a combination of hotel guests and external visitors who come to experience the excellent food.    Rooms are kept spotlessly clean like the rest of the hotel - and are visually calm and simple but cleverly designed with lovely detail touches that make guests feel at home. Of particular note is that the team provide a local pre-paid mobile phone for guests to use for the duration of their stay; making it easy to contact the staff from inside or outside the hotel.    The food prepared by the chef and team of ‘Table du Riad’ (the hotel’s restaurant) is superb; local fresh produce used sensitively and imaginatively - as well as beautifully presented.    72’s staff are its secret weapon - every member of the team is friendly and supremely helpful nothing is too much trouble.  From the simplest item of foodservice - to one-off occasions where they take the opportunity to help way beyond the call of duty;  When our flight was cancelled the manager Stefania and her team were able to accommodate us at (very!) short notice extending our stay by a total of 4 days - and ensuring we felt completely welcome throughout.  When my wife was suffering with a migraine as we were checking out the staff arranged a dark room for her attentively provided her with local remedies and virtually guarded the room to ensure peace and quiet for her until we had to leave for the airport.    In all - a fabulous experience created in no small part by an outstanding team of people - who are genuinely motivated to ensure every guest’s experience is individual and delightful.,Date of stay: June 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/josh765

Honestly we wanted to check out of the hotel due to how DIRTY it was but decided to stay because of the brilliant and kind staff who was the most accommodating excluding the manager Stefania which really felt as if she was scamming us even if she did not profit from it. Since it was our first time in Marrakech we did not know how immigration would be like and when Stefania kept on persisting that we needed something called ""Fast track"" we eventually caved in and got it which costed about 180 Euros for 3 people!!! When we got to the airport we were shocked to realise that there were more people in the fast track lane than normal immigration a total waste of money!!!

Will return soon!,We had a wonderful experience during our stay there everything was so carefully thought of from the arrival pick up at the airport to the welcome tea to the dress up of the breakfast/dinner space and the extraordinary facilities such as the Hammam and the massage. Stefania and her team were a lovely host very helpful and with an extreme care for details to make our stay as good as possible. The architecture of the Riad 72 is very authentic generous and calm and it offers multiple opportunities to set back and enjoy some quality some either alone or with a bigger group. I'd say it's great place for all sorts of guests either couples or small families. Big shout out to the stuff as well we were impressed by their kindness.

Everything about 72 Riad was perfect but the Staff is what really puts it over the top. All of them were amazing.    Also the massage I received here was one of the best I've ever had!

72 Riad Living,Derek C wrote a review May 2022,50,Birthday visit to Marrakech,We had been told by a relative that this Riad was possibly one of the best in Marrakech. Not having been to any others difficult to compare but what a super place. From the moment of booking online the staff were in contact and they ensured that our whole holiday experience was seemless and trouble free. Mehdi Stefania and in fact all the staff were brilliant. Nothing was too much trouble and our 5 night stay was therefore a delight. The room was comfortable but could perhaps do with more places to put things particulary the bedside tables were almost completley full of lamp so very little space for the essentials of travel. Clock water mug torch and spectacles. Minor niggle only. Food was great too so a marvellous place for exploring the city.  Thanks to all.

The room wasn't huge but plenty spacious and the bathroom was completely modern while still feeling special.

The staff were wonderful hospitable and incredibly helpful especially Stefania. I was exchanging emails with Stefania before our arrival and she helped organize dinners and tours for us. When we arrived at the property the staff greeted us warmly and did a traditional had wash and served us a traditional mint tea with cookies. The Riad was incredibly cozy and you felt like your were in your own home. The food at the Riad was incredible!!! The breakfast was delicious and I highly recommend the restaurant for dinner. The chicken tajine was amazing. Our weather wasn't great so we weren't able to take advantage of the rooftop terrace but it is a lovely spot to spend some time when the weather permits.

72 Riad Living,GoldstoneFamily wrote a review Apr 2022,50,The perfect escape from the hustle and bustle of the Souk,My 18-year-old daughter and I had a 4 day stay in Marrakesh and 72 Living was the perfect place to get away from the stresses of her A level studies and my busy job.    From the moment we entered through the heavy wooden door nothing was too much trouble. We were warmly greeted with the infamous Moroccan tea and treats that never ceased to flow. We loved the ambience of the Riad so much that in fact 3 out of the 4 nights we chose to eat dinner at night because the food was divine the service exceptional and it was the perfect retreat after a busy bustling day in Marrakesh and the surrounding areas.    We were so sad to leave and cannot wait to return. I'd highly recommend the Hamman and massage which was heavenly. The location was perfect to get a real sense of the myriad of Morrocan streets whilst allowing the visitor to relax to the smell of orange blossom and the gentleness of the running water.

72 Riad Living,Schnizzz wrote a review Apr 2022,50,"Excellent location, excellent value, excellent staff",The staff at Riad 72 Living were exceptionally good from the moment our bags were collected (and then carted through narrow bustling alleys to the riad's front door) to the time we reluctantly checked out after a blissful three days and nights. Drinks were delivered to the roof terrace with a friendly smile ordered on the handy cellphones they give each guest for that purpose and to provide any assistance you might need when out and about in the Medina.    Our room was beautiful and large with an enormous shower room both decked out in elegant Moroccan style. Although our room was quite dark as a result of only two small windows (something to do with the original building planning permission and character) our accompanying friends' rooms were brighter being in a more modern part of the building. We were shown some alternative rooms and realised ours was actually preferable with far more original touches and went on to enjoy its coolness in the evening.    The roof terrace is large with panoramic views of the city and Atlas Mountains and comfortable seating areas and sun loungers - a wonderful place to relax with a drink listening to the prayers from the mosques after a day of haggling and sightseeing in the labyrinthine markets.    The riad is only a few minutes' walk to the markets and palace and it would be harder to think of a more convenient place for tourists to be based. It is set a few streets back from the main thoroughfares and so also - conversely - enjoys a tranquillity you actually very much need after the hustle and bustle of the day's sightseeing.    The riad has its own spa which we didn't use but our friends rated it superb. Breakfast under the shade of the palms in the courtyard was both delicious and peaceful - a mixture of Moroccan traditional fare with French/Western influences. Something for everyone. We were really only there for a long weekend and didn't dine there in the evenings but the facility is available and the food looked amazing.    You won't be disappointed and the prices are very reasonable.,Date of stay: April 2022,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Schnizzz

The riad has expanded since our last stay and every detail is just as wonderful. All the staff are friendly and make you feel immediately at home Stefania gave us a particularly warm welcome as we were return guests which was a lovely touch.    We ate at Le Table du 72 on our first night and the food was brilliant perfect for the first night after a day's travelling.    This was our 4th trip to Marrakech and can say that 72 has one of the best locations in the city being close to Dar al Basha - it's a great reference point for taxis yet you are also walking distance to the medina (but still in a quieter location where you tnd to get hassled less. Also there are brilliant hammams in the surrounding streets).    We had booked a classic room and a jacuzzi suite and Stefania gave us adjoining rooms which sort of felt like we had our own little apartment - amazing. The weather was cool when we were there so it was a welcome treat to keep warm in the rooftop tub!

By booking directly through the Riad we were offered the best rate and a complimentary transfer to/from the airport.    Upon arrival our bags were whisked away by Aziz and we were taken through the maze of streets to the riad. Our room was gorgeous with high ceilings and beautiful furniture. The bathroom was large and had very modern fixtures and a hot shower with plenty of water pressure.    Breakfast each morning was an eclectic and delicious feast with fresh-cooked eggs fresh fruit cheese yogurt a changing daily baked item like pancakes and a bakery basket of Moroccan pastries and breads. The service was magnificent and by day two our server knew what we liked. In the evening we enjoyed the beautiful rooftop terrace with some truly delicious local wines served by the staff.

We really appreciated the quality of all the services the availability of Stefania and her entire team lead by the very kind Achraf. The whole team took great care of us from reception to departure. The Riad is sumptuous very clean and well equipped. We stayed on the patio it's really a magical experience (the candles the fountain the fragrances the Moroccan tea and even the music). Eating a delicious food on the roof with a magnificent view of Marrakech by night is an unforgettable experience.    The location of the Riad was very practical for us because it is right next to the famous Dar El Bâcha museum and its very popular coffee (you might need to book before) for lovers of great blinded coffee and also tea. Last but not least the Riad is very close to Jamaa Lafna place and the shops in the Medina.

72 Riad Living,maxrasmussen wrote a review Feb 2022,50,Early Visit after the end of Covid restrictions,"We finally got to make our much postponed visit (due to Covid restrictions on travel to Morocco) to Marrakech and 72 Riad Living. We were returning for a second visit (we first visited in 2019). this time we brought our teenaged daughter and my wife's 90 year old father. The city was still quite empty of tourists which made the experience so much the better.    The Riad was a sea of tranquility in a location that was within the franetic souk. The building is a beautiful old ""place"" with its central courtyard which serves as the restaurant and breakfast area. Around this courtyard on two levels are the bedroom each one unique. We had 3 rooms for our party and each room had its own special character. Our daughter stayed in the room that had its own roof terrace which she was really excited by (something that teenagers on holiday with their parents is not always the case !). While my father-in-law had a ground floor room in the extension to the Riad which suited him perfectly. The staff could not do enough for us ensuring that our stay was truly memorable. The continental style breakfasts were a truly magnificent spread of fruit pastries pancakes jams honey teas and coffee (eggs were also available). The perfect start for a long day in the city.    As mentioned in previous reviews the both rooms & bathrooms were all spotlessly clean. Why would anybody want to stay in one of the international hotels on the outskirts of the city when they could get a much more charismatic experience in this beautiful Riad and be located right in the middle of the old city.    The Riad would also arrange day trips to locations outside of Marrakech which were conducted on an individual party basis - i.e. just our family and a driver. We took a trip up into the Atlas mountains which was such a contrast to the city and hugely interesting to get an appreciation of the Berber people of the mountains.    As noted this was our second visit and we would not hesitate to book the Riad again when we visit Marrakech again. It makes a great base to explore both the Souk and the other areas of the city.",Date of stay: February 2022,,"Norfolk, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maxrasmussen

So calm and particular… aesthetically speaking amazing but also on human side we found a team very passionate about their job always present without being disturbing. Every detail of our experience in the riad was so precious and curated but also very natural and spontaneous. One of the best memories of Marrakesh.

72 Riad Living,Kasey wrote a review Nov 2021,50,"Outstanding location, service, and accomodation",It was a bit more than we wanted to spend but it was gorgeously appointed quiet and the food was excellent. We ate two dinners there and both were outstanding. We brought our own wine for one dinner and the corkage fee was a bit pricey at €9. The staff were very attentive and quick to respond. Located just outside the souks it made for easy transport and walking. Rooms were huge and we opted for the private terrace which wasn´t necessary because the riad was only half full and we rarely saw anyone else. Early November weather was perfect and nights were cool. A day trip to the Atlas mountains via private guide was worth it (approx. €150 for two including lunch and hike to falls). One piece of advice ... don´t bring your credit card when shopping for carpets until you know what you want and are ready to bargain. We would stay here again although it is a splurge and we didnt really spend that much time in the riad.

72 Riad Living,Natasha I wrote a review Nov 2021,50,Best Riad Experience,My husband and I stayed at 72Riad Living for our honeymoon and had the most romantic experience! From the moment you enter the Riad you get transported to a different world full of beauty relaxation and literally the best hospitality we experienced on our 10-day journey. The rooms are gorgeous with plenty of privacy the beds are very comfortable the rooftop terrace is one of the highest in the medina and was perfect to play some backgammon with a glass of wine at sunset. The food was also incredibly delicious! But the thing about the hotel truly was the customer service we felt like we were staying with family. One other thing to mention is the location. It's perfect walking distance to the souks through a more calm route. Not to mention just a few blocks from Le Jardin Secret and Dar Bacha.

We spent four nights there and from the moment we arrived knew it was the right place to stay in Marrakech. Coming out of the Marrakech Medina and into the unassuming front door we were immediately transported into an oasis of fragrance chirping birds palm trees and trickling water. The owner Stefania was incredibly helpful our entire stay. Our room had a cell phone that had contacts programmed in already which was super considerate and although we never had to use it we carried it with us until we were able to get our SIM cards working in Morocco. The staff (Aziz and Fatiha) were incredible! So kind so gracious so patient with our bad language skills. They work so hard to make their guests comfortable and they’re simply the best. What a team! The food is wonderful the rooms are beautiful the nooks and spaces around the riad are tastefully furnished and cozy. It’s hard to pick the best thing about the riad!

72 Riad Living,tansh wrote a review Oct 2020,40,"Busy outside, surprisingly peaceful inside",We stayed here for our first trip to Marrakech in Sep 2019 but had returned home to a busy year and never got to leave a review until now!    Our first night was in a Junior Suite the one/s that lead upstairs to a private jacuzzi tub on the rooftop. The following day we left our luggage with the riad to visit a desert camp and returned to a Grand Suite due to room availability. I actually prefer the former - the grand suite while very spacious felt a little empty where as the rooftop of the junior suite offered a sense of calm from the busyness of the city and the souks. Overall the property was clean there was no language barrier and service was hospitable. It was our first time to Morocco and I found the layout and architecture of the riads within the medina an eye-opener.    The transfer from the airport is very handy as an employee will wait to pick you up from the street where cars can go no further and lead you through the maze of streets to the riad. They are happy to guide you to and from the street this way but you probably won’t need the service after venturing out once or twice.    The El F’na square adjacent souks and the Ben Youssef school (it was closed for renovation at the time) are all within walking distance and we hailed taxis only to take us farther out. They operate mostly by agreed price than the meter so you do need to develop a sense of what is acceptable versus opportunistic. The riad should be able to give an idea of what’s fair.    Some restaurants one might come across while researching the trip are actually part of a riad and they typically serve local cuisine (and breakfast every morning). We didn’t stay in Marrakech for more than a few days and personally I’d suggest not to overdo the riad dining and miss out on restaurants or cafes in the city some of which seemed very interesting.,Date of stay: November 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Singapore, Singapore",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tansh

72 Riad Living,AC03 wrote a review May 2020,50,Incredible 30th Birthday stay at Riad72,We cannot recommend Riad72 enough for anyone looking for a beautiful elegant and supremely run place to stay in the heart of Marrakech. We had the pleasure of taking the property exclusively for 2 days in February for a 30th celebration with friends from around the world joining us having never been before all of whom could not compliment the service setting design location (the list goes on…) enough!    The rooms are beautifully decorated with style and taste and are great sizes with some benefiting from their own terraces and private jacuzzi’s. I would highly recommend the Arte Suite or Junior Suite if looking to treat yourself (it’s worth it!) as you get to enjoy your own terrace overlooking the rooftops of Marrakech. Perfect for sunbathing and sundowners complete with jacuzzi..! Most come with walk-in showers and/or bath combos (shower over the bath) - but if that’s important to you just be sure to check with the very friendly staff who can help recommend accordingly.    The property itself is expansive and very impressive. The courtyards come alive at night with candles music and feels very romantic and alluring. During the day they provide a great space to escape the sun whilst still taking in the stunning sky above and through the large trees. The rooftops are exceptional - and provide many spaces to eat drink relax and sunbathe. Being above all the other neighbouring properties really allowed you to take in the great weather endless vistas and are a great vantage point for taking in the snowcapped Atlas Mountains in the distance.    The location is very convenient situated just outside of the souks (3/4 min walk) in an area that feels very safe. The hotel has a porter than can walk with you to wherever you would like to go - and can assist with taxis private cars etc. very easily. We enjoyed walking with guests in and out of the souks and to neighbouring restaurants with ease. The riad are also very good at organising private transport (we often had 4/5 Viano’s on the go to help with guests getting around airport transfers etc) and are very competitively priced whilst offering a very professional service. We would highly recommend using this service through them should you need it - it’s worth the little bit extra.    The food and drink menus are wide ranging for a property of this size with breakfast lunch and dinner all being of very high quality and beautifully presented. They have an excellent selection of Moroccan wines and dishes (the Valoublia rose is a particular favourite). Meals can be enjoyed all over the property / where you wish and would thoroughly recommend enjoying dinner there one evening - as the restaurant is very highly regarded in Marrakech.    For our event we of course got to sample all of the above and cannot say a bad word about it. The terrace was the perfect spot to welcome guests for a champagne and canapé reception as they were treated to the most spectacular sunset whilst taking in some local musicians. It made for some sensational pictures! The canapés were plentiful and very tasty - a must have if doing something similar. This was followed by the most exceptional dinner with a beautifully designed long table for 30 adorned with candles roses and glassware - which we left in Stefania’s hands who did an amazing job. The setting was incredible and truly memorable - as was the food they served to guests. Everything was done with such thoughtful attention to detail - brilliantly presented whilst being very wholesome and leaving no one going hungry! Our guests (and ourselves) were beyond impressed and felt very special throughout - which is exactly how we wanted them to feel. It was a flawless evening that then opened up into the courtyard with a little music more drinks and conversation flowing well into the night.    Last but by no means least was service - which was very expertly executed friendly and efficient throughout. A very special mention goes to Stefania who does such a fantastic job at leading the team and creating a very effortless and pleasant experience for guests. She works very hard to ensure everything is just right and this naturally feeds through to the team - all of whom could not do enough to help you. This is what transformed the experience and our stay for us - from housekeeping to waiters bellboys to restaurant managers… no request was too big and Stefania and the team did a brilliant job at taking much of the stress out of organising and running such a fantastic event.    We cannot thank them enough for helping create the most special memories for us - and wouldn’t think twice about staying there again. We have been to Marrakech nine times now and out of all the medina properties this has been our favourite. If you are looking for an authentic stylish elegant expertly-run riad in the Medina - do not think twice and go here! You will not be disappointed.,Date of stay: February 2020,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LondonAC3

72 Riad Living,jodyk wrote a review Mar 2020,50,"72 Riad Living was amazing, except for the manager!",The riad was lovely well appointed conveniently located great food and attentive staff. I can't say enough about the food the service and the front desk gentleman who gave me an extra bar of soap!  I have been in the luxury tourism industry for 13 years and I have also traveled extensively for leisure and business since the 1980's. I can honestly say that the manager of the riad (who was not Moroccan) was arrogant and not accommodating.  We were a group of 13 adults traveling together from the US March 8-20. In light of the corona virus pandemic the manger should have been a little more flexible. We had one traveler who cancelled the trip 12 days before our arrival..the hotel policy was 14 day cancellation. The manager would not budge on cancelling the one room for a 4 night stay. We had a a total of 40 room nights. Seriously?!?!  Our tour guide who normally would have stayed at a less expensive property ended up staying in the beautiful room that the manager would not refund. The manager begrudged our tour leader for giving the guide that room (that was paid for). How dare the manager dictate who should stay in that room!  In any event my travel advisor friend (who was with us as our tour leader) will be organizing many more trips to Marrakech in the future and will not book this riad again. In this competitive hospitality business it is important to work with appreciative and understanding partners. It's a shame because the property was delightful.,Date of stay: March 2020,,"Scottsdale, Arizona",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joders2020

72 Riad Living,James wrote a review Mar 2020,50,Absolute perfection,We've just returned to London from a beautiful weekend staying at 72 Riad Living. Stefania and the extended team were beyond accommodating. The property feels premium and authentic. The food and service were both world-class. In reality parts of Marrakesh can feel a little overwhelming (when wandering the souks and streets all day) but not in the areas around 72 Riad Living. There are so many fascinating tourist destinations within a short walking distance from the hotel and it is without a doubt the best possible location in the whole city. It is an incredible and safe place to stay. I would highly recommend you arrange airport transfers through them also as it makes the entire experience extraordinarily seamless and relaxing.,Date of stay: March 2020,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D5511NGjam

72 Riad Living,abparekh wrote a review Mar 2020,50,Perfect riad hospitality,Wonderful stay in Marrakech and the most perfect riad experience without a doubt.    Highlights:  1. Manager Stefania was always prompt in answering our emails and helping with the smallest requests.  2. She provided a fantastic overview to get our bearings around the medina at check-in  3. The riad is beautiful a great blend of modern and traditional elements with spaces to lounge about in and a cute rooftop terrace  4. Location is perfect for those who want to be in the medina but not in the thick of the chaos. Definitely more walking to get to the sightseeing but the closest parking is just 5 minutes away  5. We were given a local phone to use while in the riad and carry while walking around like having a personal concierge in your pocket!  6. Breakfast on the rooftop - Everything fresh delicious and locally sourced    The only thing that would have made our stay better is if we had booked a larger room we found the standard rooms a little small for 2 people. But since we were out most of the day this is minor.    Everyone on the staff went above and beyond in anticipating our needs and making us feel as comfortable as possible. Truly the service was so welcoming and genuinely warm.

72 Riad Living,Tue H wrote a review Feb 2020,50,The essense of quality Riad living,My wife and I stayed for four nights in week 7 2020. The riad was everything we hoped for. Super surroundings very nice room and very nice staff.    At the same time the riad is situated in a good spot (no noise at all) close to almost everything. You can walk to almost any place worth seeing or get a cab very easily.    We dined at the restaurant the first night and this was a pleasant Morrocan tasting experience.    Should I recommend the management team one thing should it be to add some more variety to the breakfast serving. A small detail :-)    All in all.

72 Riad Living,TinyTraveler001 wrote a review Feb 2020,50,Best Marrakech stay,We booked here on the recommendation of a friend and we were so glad we did. We booked a deluxe room which comes with either a big shower or tub and is either courtyard side or has a private terrace- we ended up with a courtyard facing and shower so if you have a strong preference I would request via email or phone in advance.    The service from start to finish was outstanding. We booked an airport transfer the driver was so professional and the car was immaculate and smelled great. A luggage porter was waiting for us and led the way we were greeted by mint tea and a breakdown of the area with a very helpful map.    We were so grateful we chose to stay here it was a very conveniently located respite from the souks and was incredibly tranquil. We didn’t try the spa but wish we had. The renovation with a local architect is incredible and every facet of the design is gorgeous. Everyone we interacted with was friendly and eager to help our room was beautifully decorated and the bed was comfortable. Make sure you eat a meal at the restaurant and that you enjoy a drink up on the roof at sunset both are can’t miss.    I really enjoyed breakfast especially the local cheese and honey. If you do get eggs consider splitting them as the omelette is quite large.    The only things that could be improved are is that it got a little chilly in the room at night (but keep in mind that this is in January) and that from the bathroom window even closed smoke seemed to come in from the street. I’m not sure the latter can be fixed.    The other tip I have is to avoid the taxi stand nearby if possible that is the only stand we were consistently ripped off at (10 euro for a short ride) and they refused to negotiate.,Date of stay: January 2020,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"New York City, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TinyTraveler001

72 Riad Living,Meagantromburg wrote a review Dec 2019,50,Beautiful Riad,I absolutely loved my stay at Riad 72. We did a lot of research on the best Riad's before arriving in Marrakech and we were not at all disappointed. We elected to get the transfer service from the airport to the hotel which was a little more expensive than a taxi would be but totally worth it. It would be a hard introduction to Marrakech to be dropped at a taxi stand and then try to figure out where to go. So someone was waiting at the drop off point for us carried our bags in a cart and led us to the Riad. The location is totally perfect away from the bustle of the crowded streets and quiet inside. We were presented with a traditional hand washing and tea and cookies.    Our room was so lovely well appointed and probably one of the most comfortable beds and comforters that I have ever slept on. I seriously wish I knew which brand the comforter was because I would have purchased it. We didn't get to enjoy the roof but we did go up and it was very pretty. We only had breakfast at the Riad (delicious) but several people were enjoying dinner each night and the atmosphere looked very nice. We had to leave very early in the morning to catch a tour on our departure morning and they were so kind to prepare us a to-go breakfast. It was completely dark and very early and the gentleman that prepared it for us was just SO gracious and hospitable and it truly made us feel so special.,Date of stay: November 2019,,"Chicago, Illinois",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Meagantromburg
72 Riad Living,sarahhcassidy wrote a review Dec 2019,50,"Beautiful, luxurious riad in a great location.",Riad 72 is wonderful! I stayed at multiple riads while traveling in Morocco and Riad 72 was by far the most luxurious and has the most professional staff.    We used the hotel shuttle I would recommend if you are arriving into Marrakech for your first time. If you’re familiar with the medina and taxi areas you could manage on your own. It was about a 2 minute walk from the El Bacha taxi stop very easy.    The staff was very welcoming and accommodating. We had to leave very early and the employee working at 6am prepared a breakfast to go for us (delicious fruit and individually wrapped breads and sweets! Thank you!) and offered to carry our bags to the taxi stand. We met with the manager upon arrival and she gave us an overview of the hotel and tips for Marrakech. A member of the cleaning staff went into the room at least twice a day to tidy up and refill toiletries it was not needed but very much appreciated.    The hotel itself is stunning. The roof is relaxing and has amazing views there are TWO beautiful corridors to relax eat and take pictures in. The breakfast was great and I was so happy to have a bowl full of fresh pomegranate seeds! Many places serve the juice but not the actual seeds. The coffee at Riad 72 is very good. I found it near impossible to find good coffee outside of this riad. The best was THE MOST COMFORTABLE bed I’ve slept in in my entire life. The rooms are quiet and comfortable with great wi-fi. The location is perfect to the medina and to a main road/taxis. My only regret is not having dinner here. I would come back for dinner if given the opportunity.

72 Riad Living,Jef21 wrote a review Nov 2019,50,Exceeds all expectations,I went back and forth on whether to stay in the Medina in a Riad or to stay outside in a luxury hotel. 72 Riad combined the bests of both luxury in the Medina. The Riad is so much more charming and sumptuous than the photos show. Our room was bigger and nicer than we had expected and the tub was so deep and luxurious we both had to take a bath (which I would normally never do in a hotel). The Riad is in the heart of the Medina but still very easy to find and easy walking distance to any where you want to go in the area. The staff was friendly helpful and went out of their way to make you feel at home. Drinks on the roof top at sunset was a great break at the end of the day sightseeing before heading out to dinner (or staying in because the food in the road is also spectacular). If I had any complaint it was that our time there came too quickly to an end.,Date of stay: October 2019,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jef21

72 Riad Living,DD17DD wrote a review Nov 2019,40,Nice private terrace with our suite,My daughter and I stayed here for two nights after leaving a Riad that had building work next to it!  This one was situated in a nice and quiet area. I booked a suite with sun beds & private terrace. We had a jacuzzi but didn’t use it as it was dirty inside. It was very nice to sit out alone. This was accessed by a narrow flight of stairs but worth it!  We had a lovely breakfast up there both days. It’s a set breakfast for everyone including omelette choice bread / pancakes and cakes ( mmm- delicious) yoghurt & fruit. So a good selection.  The room was nice & spacious & had a big double shower & separate toilet. Handy when sharing with your daughter!  Water is replenished daily.  The Riad has no pool but a cool seating area on the ground floor and a nice communal rooftop terrace with tables sun beds & small bar. It could definitely do with some nice plants up there to soften the area. It was a stark contrast from our previous Riad that had plants and flowers everywhere- making it much prettier !  Locationally it is in a quieter part of the Souks. It’s a 5/6 minute walk down alleyways to the main Souk & fairly busy all around.  A couple of staff were very friendly & helped me a lot on the last day with printing new boarding passes & medicine for my daughter- thank you. Xx  A couple were not so friendly.  Overall a nice stay in what is a spotlessly clean and well kept Riad.  Ps.

Evenings all began on their Terrace where fabulous sunsets and the haunting call to prayer from 3 or more nearby Mosques was an absolutely mesmerising experience.  Expanded food and drink options made the Riad just that little bit more sophisticated with it's honest charms very much still present.

72 Riad Living,beaulygraham wrote a review Nov 2019,50,A hidden treasure,We booked our trip to Marrakesh early in the year. I found it difficult to find the right hotel at the right price and then I stumbled upon Riad 72. It looked like a pretty decent boutique hotel with really reasonable pricing. We booked and didn’t think much of it for the next few months.    We were travelling with my little one (21 months) and as the date approached I started to worry about what my toddler would be able to eat (we are vegan) and whether he would be bored. I should have booked ourselves into a big resort I thought.    On arriving at Riad 72 tucked away on a quiet street behind an unassuming door I soon learnt that I couldn’t have chosen a better place to stay.    The hotel is beautiful. Stepping off the crazy streets of Marrakesh and into a palatial sanctuary I immediately felt at home. My toddler felt at ease straight away - probably due to all the special attention he received from the friendly staff!    We had two rooms here; a suite with private terrace and I think what was the hotel’s most basic room. The suite was gorgeous and we weren’t sure how we would cope with moving down to a smaller room. The basic room was much smaller but it didn’t matter because we discovered the hotel’s roof terrace which was open to all guests. The perfect spot.    The food was really good. We made some special requests for meals to suit our dietary requirements/fussy child and they were more than happy to oblige.    The staff at Riad 72 are brilliant. Genuinely friendly approachable and attentive. We truly felt at home here and even part of the family.

The taxi was waiting on arrival and our welcome at the Rhiad was friendly with mint tea and local cakes. We arrived late morning and they assured us that they would try and get our room ready ASAP. The Rhiad has a lovely central courtyard with palm trees and tables. A lovely gesture of asking us which soap we would prefer in our room was unexpected and very novel. We had booked the classic double room which is simple but beautifully designed with a superking size bed lovely linen and very comfortable. Everything has been hand picked to be traditional but chic. Staff are friendly but not overly attentive. We had the Hammam in house in a their very small sauna room. It was fabulous but very intimate!! Breakfast is good and you can choose to have it on the ground floor or on the roof terrace... a lovely oasis for quiet sunbathing a cocktail or tea.

72 Riad Living,Tom Clement wrote a review Oct 2019,50,Magical Experience,I’ve travelled extensively and stayed at many 5 star hotels. Without a doubt Riad 72 has been the most magical hotel experiences of my life!    Hidden behind a heavy wood door down a narrow alleyway in the Medina (safe any time of day) is an architecturally stunning riad spread on multiple levels around an open courtyard – sculpted archways tile work and fountains – straight out of Architectural Digest. The rooms are air conditioned and tastefully decorated with Moroccan carpets and artifacts. The main dining room off the central courtyard is breathtaking and the rooftop bar/patio offers stunning views over the Medina.    Food and service are truly exceptional – breakfasts are substantial and the three evening meals that we enjoyed over our extended stay were top notch and worthy of a Michelin star. Stefania Conte (the onsite manager) has assembled an A-team – a special callout to Ayoub Aziz Ahmeds 1 and 2 Asma and Abdul who always met us with a smile and made our stay truly memorable.    The riad has acquired a huge adjoining property and construction is underway on an oversized swimming pool and a second dining venue (open to outside patrons) while retaining the intimate feel that comes from having just 13 rooms. It’s set for completion in spring of 2020.    I can’t wait to return.,Date of stay: October 2019,,"Toronto, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TomC_Toronto

There will probably be an enterprising young man to take your luggage to the Riad - he will expect a tip of approx 5 EUR or USD. Otherwise you can make arrangements with the Riad directly but if you are unfamiliar with Marrakech you can easily get lost so it is well worth it to get some guidance.    Parking is very secure - a few of the local Riads do park their vehicles there as well.    I ate at the restaurant and enjoyed a glass of wine on the rooftop while listening to the evening call to prayer - truly magical.    Plus - the Riad is expanding and looking to add a pool / additional facilities. I hope to check it out once completed.,Date of stay: September 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Montreal, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Magnum55
72 Riad Living,David S wrote a review Sep 2019,50,Excellent service and accommodation,My wife and I did extensive research on the best places and activities in Marakech before our trip. 72 Riad Living kept coming up in our searches so we made our reservations. It certainly did not disappoint. The airport transfer was easy and the short walk through the streets of Marakech to the Riad was a great experience. One we arrived the service was incredible with a personal introduction and Moroccan tea. The entire Riad was beautiful and our room was a blended the original structure with high end modern touches. Of all 5 places we stayed in Morocco and Spain this was our favorite room. The food was delicious as well. The included breakfast was an assortment of breads jellies honey butter local cheese fresh orange juice and excellent coffee or tea. We both tried two of the tanjin meals that you need to order in advance. We had four tanjin meals in Morocco and this was the most flavorful and rich off the ones we tried. The lamb one was my favorite with the fast of the lamb adding great depth of flavor.    Also the location is ideal as well. It is a 3 minute walk to the start of the famous soukes (local shopping stores or stalls) and it is a 10 minute walk to the main square. There was nothing they were not willing to help with or try to provide and they were gracious with every request. They even helped us move our reservation at the restaurant Nomad after we mistakenly booked the wrong day. They do provide a security guard who can escort you if needed but honestly there was never a time that we felt unsafe or harassed in Marakech. It was much easier than we even expected and it was even fun negotiation for the prices (also long as you know beforehand about how much the more expensive items should be and that nearly every negotiation starts at least double or triple the real price you will pay).    The only real challenge for this Riad (and the other two we visited) is that these were designed as homes not hotels. So the stairs are usually narrow winding stairwells with lower clearances particularly at the roof access. It makes it charming and we are about 40 do this was not a problem for is other than negotiating bags up or down at times. Yet this is the only true challenge in what was an incredible experience.    Important note: We checked out to several other riads and you definitely get what you pay for. This is not the cheapest riad but it is a great value.,Date of stay: September 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Maineville, Ohio",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I8883JQdavids

72 Riad Living,Manuel P wrote a review Sep 2019,50,Great Riad!,If you staying in the Medina you have to look carefully for a good Riad/Hotel since it becomes your oasis in a very charmingly chaotic city and Riad was just that an oasis for relaxing recharging and rest from the heat and walking around Marrakech.    Rooms: I thing they only have six and I saw two of them (friends were staying there) and both were comfortable with good size and good bathrooms. Air conditioner work smoothly and rooms were impeccable in general. Great size btw and very quite.    Location: In the north of the Medina very close to the souks but also close to a taxi stop on a road with traffic to get to other areas fast. From the taxi stop the walking is not long so it is not a problem when carrying the luggage they send someone with our luggage on the checkout which was appreciated.    Riad: In general it was great they had a fabulous terrace with plenty of sitting area and it was nice at night when the heat was not as intense as during the they they offer spa treatments and restaurant service we only used for the breakfast and it was nice but simple fruit and bread. Only thin i felt missing was a pool I didn't look for a pool but once you are there in the heat it sure looks at something that would be great to have to refresh.,Date of stay: August 2019,,"Monterrey, Mexico",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/manuelp232

Morocco is a country full of history that is becoming modern very fast. A mix of old and contemporary and huge architecture describe moroccan cities.  People is very friendly.

Its on a quiet side street off of the main road so I found that this helped to keep it quiet safe and peaceful when walking to and from. We had a deluxe room that had its own private rooftop terrace. The staff was wonderful from the moment we were picked up at the airport to the moment they dropped us back off to go home. Breakfast while simple was delicious! We opted for the fast track option at the airport and they helped to arrange this on our behalf. I highly recommend you get it as the lines can get gnarly at security and we were able to breeze by the crowds with the fast track option.    Stay here!

72 Riad Living,Luciana B wrote a review Aug 2019,50,Gorgeous property with delicious food and attentive staff,I came across this property on Tablet which curates boutique hotels around the world. I was looking for something upscale but still true to Morocco. I was very happy with this Riad. It has a very good location inside the Medina with a short and relatively simple walk to the taxi stand and as you walk through the door you get an immediate feeling of warmth and relaxation. With two internal patios that are gorgeously appointed and punctuated by chirping birds and a wonderful 360 degree view of the Medina from the rooftop terrace there are multiple options to relax. The food is superb and you should ensure you leave some room for that! Bedrooms are beautifully done although there are some at courtyard level that open directly to the patio and have less privacy. I would ask for an upstairs room although you would need to be prepared to climb upstairs (it is the Medina after all!). The only thing missing is a pool to cool down at the end of the day but I am told this is in the works...,Date of stay: July 2019,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/373lucianab

72 Riad Living,SheriSR wrote a review Jul 2019,40,Pictuaresque Riad,This is a Riad located on a narrow street deep within the medina. The interior is beautiful and well appointed. The inner court yard is quite charming and a good place for a cozy dinner. Note it is not an outdoor courtyard. The only other amenities besides the dining were an outdoor rooftop terrace. So if you contemplate cooling off poolside between excursions this riad would not be a good fit.  My concern is the steps. Many of the rooms are accessed only by 2 flights of winding stairs. Our original room was a very tiny 2 level space with the bed and bath up an extra level. Fortunately we were able to upgrade to a lovely suite with 2 rooms and 2 baths. It totally changed our experience into a positive one.  The staff was incredibly wonderful professional and caring. The manager Steffania was attuned to her guests and went out of her way to insure a good stay. Her support staff included Maria and Ahmet who were equally committed to supporting the guests and assisting in all ways possible.,Date of stay: July 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,New York City,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SheriSR

Stefania the manager and the entire staff was extremely courteous and understanding of our every needs. Very patient and helpful. The riad was more than a place to stay it's both a showcase of morrocan art and a home away from home. We are so glad to have chosen Riad 72 as our introduction to Moroccan culture.

72 Riad Living,Canuckster wrote a review May 2019,30,“Meh” -rakesh,I believe this riad sadly fell a little bit short of the reviews in media and online… Such as the Telegraph newspaper.    The riad offers transfer from the airport however despite having book this and sending them a reminder the same morning to reconfirm the driver was nowhere to be found as we exited the airport. After two phone calls and I tiny bit of confusion on their behalf the driver showed up and we made it to the hotel fine.    On the plus side despite arriving before noon we only had to wait 20 minutes for a room to be ready. Check-in is in mid afternoon. We had room number five. I wouldn’t recommend this room necessarily. The glass door to the bathroom was quite heavy and was perpetually stuck which seemed a little bit dangerous. The bathroom was quite warm so you had to keep the door closed in order to keep the AC working well in the bedroom adjacent.    The wooden stairs to the entry-level below were a little bit precarious but manageable. A room opened up onto the courtyard but with direct sun for a good portion of the day it was too hot to sit outside. The rooftop is comfy and nice but nothing special… The view of the mosque is great that said. The hotel does not have a pool or even a plunge pool… So if you’re looking to cool off you’re pretty much confined to your shower unless you get a room with a pool and a tub. It was hotter than Mars on the first day we were there so a plunge pool would’ve been nice.    Food and beverage service was awkwardly chaotic at times although the staff were quite cheery and pleasant. Riad 72 goes out of its way to promote its restaurant but we found the food somewhat uninspired and bland.    This trip was a special occasion for us and it was a little disappointing that this hotel under delivered despite getting good reviews elsewhere.

Along with the table-side hand washing in the sunny atrium lobby and delicious mint tea and cute pastries upon our arrival the very professional and warm property manager Stefania personally welcomed us. She sat down with us to explain the Riad's many ammentities as well as the miriad of sites in the city. But the entire staff was truly great - always full of smiles and willing to help us. The attention to detail was evident everywhere.....the ultra-fresh gourmet meals served in their on-site restaurant the chic design elements in our our room and throughout the property the breakfast and roof-top bar serivce - all wonderful! Housekeeping was meticulous with their daily routine as well! It is located within easy walking distance of the main square and souks through charming back alleys where kids were always playing! But a good night's sleep was had because of how quiet it was there. And extremely safe too. DO request a pick-up at the airport from Riad 72 plus the porter service (the taxi cannot go that far back into the narrow passages). It is a wonderful convenience (a minimal charge) and can be confusing your first time there if you try to do it yourself.

72 Riad Living,aweisman wrote a review Apr 2019,50,A Riad with Class,We are a family of 6 (4 adult children) who stayed at this beautiful and elegant Riad for 3 nights.    No request was too much for the staff. Service was beyond imagination. We requested a private spot for dinner our first night there. They set up a perfect spot for only us to have a private dinner. Breakfasts and afternoons on their terrace overlooking the rooftops of the Médina is a site to be seen.    The complimentary cell phones which are equipped in each room was a perfect way for all of us to stay connected throughout the day in addition it gives a great sense of security (not getting lost in the city with its google maps).    The location is nice since the Riad is tucked away in a quiet alley but close enough to the “souk” in the Medina (only a 7 minute walk). The Famous Square “Jemma el Fnaa” is about a 15 minute walk away. We felt this location suited us well.    Breakfast were very good. You can request eggs to order and cappuccino. Unfortunately we discovered this out only on the last day.    I highly recommend this fabulous Riad with high class service and a great location.

The beauty of Riad 72 is that they will allow you to eat anywhere. We chose to have dinner and breakfast in the roof. The weather was beautiful in March. Our hosts met our every need. Really great location. Proximate to the nice stores in the souks.  Surprises of the trip. How kind everyone was across the country. How great Moroccan wine is and how fun it is to shop there.

We were met by a luggage attendant who walked us to the Riad. Pay attention to landmarks and they don’t use street names at all. Now I had never stayed at a Riad before and it more than exceeded my expectations. From the way it looks outside it’s hard to imagine how gorgeous the inside is. It’s amazing. With beautiful wildlife gardens inside and amazing colors. Fantastic. The staff was amazing. They take care of the luggage for you while you wash your hands in orange blossom water. Then you sit for Moroccan tea and pastries. While relaxing a nice person comes to offer you a soap of your choice for use in your room. The bars smell lovely and are handmade with no chemicals. Once we were shown to our room we were more than impressed. We had a family suite and it was perfect for our group. There was one large room with a queen bed full shower and bathroom. The other bedroom (mine) smaller but nice with a twin bed and a bathroom with shower. Perfect actually. We had two terraces overlooking the inside of the hotel. And our favorite part was our private terrace with our private jacuzzi! Not very big but awesome for the chilly nights. We could overlook the city as it was rooftop. And the price was crazy good! I can’t believe how affordable this place was something like 700 euros for the two nights. Now we split this by three which made it a great deal.

Once we were shown to our room we were more than impressed. We had a family suite and it was perfect for our group. There was one large room with a queen bed full shower and bathroom. The other bedroom (mine) smaller but nice with a twin bed and a bathroom with shower. Perfect actually. We had two terraces overlooking the inside of the hotel. And our favorite part was our private terrace with our private jacuzzi! Not very big but awesome for the chilly nights. We could overlook the city as it was rooftop. And the price was crazy good! I can’t believe how affordable this place was something like 700 euros for the two nights. Now we split this by three which made it a great deal. We didn’t have any meals at the Riad but the ones we saw looked very good.

We had dinner at the Riad on the first night and the food was lovely. We also took advantage of the facilities and had hamman and a massage.

The room was excellent; it was very large and spotlessly clean every day. I even saw a cleaner one day moving a lamp to clean under and around the base; something you would never see at a normal property. Finally the on-site restaurant was delicious.

72 Riad Living,Travel O wrote a review Feb 2019,50,Definitely a great place to stay in Marrakech!,We arrived Marrakech and met our driver from the Riad. He quickly drove us to the location - about 20mins away from the airport. We had to walk about 5 mins from the drop off location as there is no easy route for an vehicle. We were met by a luggage attendant who walked us to the Riad. Pay attention to landmarks and they don’t use street names at all. Now I had never stayed at a Riad before and it more than exceeded my expectations. From the way it looks outside it’s hard to imagine how gorgeous the inside is. It’s amazing. With beautiful wildlife gardens inside and amazing colors. Fantastic. The staff was amazing. They take care of the luggage for you while you wash your hands in orange blossom water. Then you sit for Moroccan tea and pastries. While relaxing a nice person comes to offer you a soap of your choice for use in your room. The bars smell lovely and are handmade with no chemicals. Once we were shown to our room we were more than impressed. We had a family suite and it was perfect for our group. There was one large room with a queen bed full shower and bathroom. The other bedroom (mine) smaller but nice with a twin bed and a bathroom with shower. Perfect actually. We had two terraces overlooking the inside of the hotel. And our favorite part was our private terrace with our private jacuzzi! Not very big but awesome for the chilly nights. We could overlook the city as it was rooftop. And the price was crazy good! I can’t believe how affordable this place was something like 700 euros for the two nights. Now we split this by three which made it a great deal. We didn’t have any meals at the Riad but the ones we saw looked very good.

72 Riad Living,Travel O wrote a review Feb 2019,50,Definitely a great place to stay in Marrakech!,We arrived Marrakech and met our driver from the Riad. He quickly drove us to the location - about 20mins away from the airport. We had to walk about 5 mins from the drop off location as there is no easy route for an vehicle. We were met by a luggage attendant who walked us to the Riad. Pay attention to landmarks and they don’t use street names at all. Now I had never stayed at a Riad before and it more than exceeded my expectations. From the way it looks outside it’s hard to imagine how gorgeous the inside is. It’s amazing. With beautiful wildlife gardens inside and amazing colors. Fantastic. The staff was amazing. They take care of the luggage for you while you wash your hands in orange blossom water. Then you sit for Moroccan tea and pastries. While relaxing a nice person comes to offer you a soap of your choice for use in your room. The bars smell lovely and are handmade with no chemicals. Once we were shown to our room we were more than impressed. We had a family suite and it was perfect for our group. There was one large room with a queen bed full shower and bathroom. The other bedroom (mine) smaller but nice with a twin bed and a bathroom with shower. Perfect actually. We had two terraces overlooking the inside of the hotel. And our favorite part was our private terrace with our private jacuzzi! Not very big but awesome for the chilly nights. We could overlook the city as it was rooftop. And the price was crazy good! I can’t believe how affordable this place was something like 700 euros for the two nights. Now we split this by three which made it a great deal. We didn’t have any meals at the Riad but the ones we saw looked very good.

We arranged the airport transfer directly with the Riad and from start to finish we could not fault the service provided by the management and staff. We were greeted at the airport by our driver who were very knowledgeable and gave us a history of the city whilst travelling to the Riad.    When we got to the destination a porter was there waiting for us to take our bags through the narrow little windy roads to the hidden Riad.    Upon arrival at the Riad we were sat down at the courtyard and provided with fresh mint tea and pastries to unwind. We were then joined by the manager Stefania who gave us really helpful information on the things we can see / do at Marrakech.    Our room (junior suite) was amazing and we had our own private balcony with a jacuzzi bath. What we found really helpful was the handy mobile phone the Riad provided which gave us gps and internet access whilst we were out and about. We used it a lot!    We had dinner at the Riad on the first night and the food was lovely. We also took advantage of the facilities and had hamman and a massage.    Our two nights stay was bliss we couldn't have asked for more.    The Riad was wonderful and the view were amazing. The staff were impeccable.

72 Riad Living,angeladickson100 wrote a review Feb 2019,50,Hidden little gem!,Whilst in Marrakech my friend and I stayed at Riad 72.    We arranged the airport transfer directly with the Riad and from start to finish we could not fault the service provided by the management and staff. We were greeted at the airport by our driver who were very knowledgeable and gave us a history of the city whilst travelling to the Riad.    When we got to the destination a porter was there waiting for us to take our bags through the narrow little windy roads to the hidden Riad.    Upon arrival at the Riad we were sat down at the courtyard and provided with fresh mint tea and pastries to unwind. We were then joined by the manager Stefania who gave us really helpful information on the things we can see / do at Marrakech.    Our room (junior suite) was amazing and we had our own private balcony with a jacuzzi bath. What we found really helpful was the handy mobile phone the Riad provided which gave us gps and internet access whilst we were out and about. We used it a lot!    We had dinner at the Riad on the first night and the food was lovely. We also took advantage of the facilities and had hamman and a massage.    Our two nights stay was bliss we couldn't have asked for more.    The Riad was wonderful and the view were amazing. The staff were impeccable.

Every single employee was extremely helpful and friendly at every encounter. The location was prime within walking distance to the Medina and the new city. The room was excellent; it was very large and spotlessly clean every day. I even saw a cleaner one day moving a lamp to clean under and around the base; something you would never see at a normal property. Finally the on-site restaurant was delicious. We actually ate there every night and enjoyed every meal. They were also quite accommodating with our sleeping infant and served us meals on the terrace directly outside our room.

72 Riad Living,Travel O wrote a review Feb 2019,50,Definitely a great place to stay in Marrakech!,We arrived Marrakech and met our driver from the Riad. He quickly drove us to the location - about 20mins away from the airport. We had to walk about 5 mins from the drop off location as there is no easy route for an vehicle. We were met by a luggage attendant who walked us to the Riad. Pay attention to landmarks and they don’t use street names at all. Now I had never stayed at a Riad before and it more than exceeded my expectations. From the way it looks outside it’s hard to imagine how gorgeous the inside is. It’s amazing. With beautiful wildlife gardens inside and amazing colors. Fantastic. The staff was amazing. They take care of the luggage for you while you wash your hands in orange blossom water. Then you sit for Moroccan tea and pastries. While relaxing a nice person comes to offer you a soap of your choice for use in your room. The bars smell lovely and are handmade with no chemicals. Once we were shown to our room we were more than impressed. We had a family suite and it was perfect for our group. There was one large room with a queen bed full shower and bathroom. The other bedroom (mine) smaller but nice with a twin bed and a bathroom with shower. Perfect actually. We had two terraces overlooking the inside of the hotel. And our favorite part was our private terrace with our private jacuzzi! Not very big but awesome for the chilly nights. We could overlook the city as it was rooftop. And the price was crazy good! I can’t believe how affordable this place was something like 700 euros for the two nights. Now we split this by three which made it a great deal. We didn’t have any meals at the Riad but the ones we saw looked very good. Great place to stay in Marrakech!,Date of stay: February 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/worldtravelerroxy

The managers and the staff are all very helpful. My wife became ill during our four-day stay and the riad staff did everything possible to make her comfortable including bringing special drinks making special food and going out to buy medicine. They even followed up with an e-mail after we left the riad asking about my wife's condition. Our room was spacious and well designed. The meal areas are very pleasant and the rooftop area is very relaxing and provides a nice view of the city. Reasonable rates. Nice people. Good food.

72 Riad Living,Jenny_Dom wrote a review May 2018,50,Hidden Gem,We stayed here for 5 nights and it was a hidden gem nestled in between the chaos of Marrakech. After an early morning flight from the U.K and a long wait at the airport the pick up organised by the Riad was great. A swift meet and greet and then the short 15-20 min drive to the Riad. We where aware that we arrived before the normal check in time but was delighted that after a light refreshment of tea and pastries and an introduction given by Stefania we were able to check in. Everything was explained tours breakfast Riad policy hamman etc..    Our room was traditional decorated and the best thing of all is the staircase that lead to our private terrace/balcony with Sunloungers and an outside shower which I think is the only one in the Riad. The only issue is that if there is music playing on the roof terrace it can be heard from the room but after midnight it was switched off so it was ok for us. Breakfast was a small selection of fresh bread and pastries with tea/coffee fresh orange juice. The Riad itself is wonderfully decorated with the flowing water centrepiece in the tranquil courtyard. The staff were very pleasant and helpful and always willing to assist with any questions. We booked the Hamman and massage which after a stressful day navigating the souks was much needed. The Hamman lady was a local which gave the experience an authentic feel. She did not speak a word of English but she was great and made the experience comfortable and had us in stitches from laughing so much. And the massage after was that added touch. A tip please drink loads of water before the Hamman because it gets very hot inside.    We ate lunch on the rooftop terrace which was a beautiful setting and the burger 72 was a delight after eating tagine and couscous for 4 days. The food was tasty and had flavour. We did not eat dinner at the restaurant but can say the restaurant was full almost every night we were there.    We had a mobile phone given to us for the duration of our stay but it was not needed but good to have in case of any emergencies which I think is an added touch thought of by the Riad.    Overall a wonderful stay at the Riad!

We are very happy to have stayed at the beautiful Riad 72. The staff was wonderful and very helpful they made an effort to make us feel welcome. Stefania the manager is super nice and gave us a lot of useful information about Marrakech on the first day. The hotel also provided us with cellphones in case we got lost or needed any assistance. Luckily we did not have to use them but it made us feel safe. Breakfast was tasty and fresh and we also had dinner at the restaurant the first night The food was delicious and we would definitely recommend having dinner there.

72 Riad Living,ymini wrote a review Mar 2018,50,Best and most beautiful riad,From the moment we arrived we stayed 4 nights and until departure the service and the staff were impeccable.  Perfect riad within the Medina to explore Marrakech.  Only 5 mins walk to the soul ( heart of the Medina)and easy for transfers tours and taxis to drop off and pick up. Most roads are located in alleyways were cars cannot get to and this is a 2 min walk out of the riad into a place where the cars can get you which is really important.  The room layout decor was beyond what I expected and very luxurious.  Really nice terrace where you can order drinks.  No bar but despite that you can order a drink anywhere in the riad making it really feel like home.  Bed is really comfortable and the food is amazing as well.  Would definitely recommend this to anyone visiting Marrakech. I have travelled to many places and stayed in many hotels and this is definitely more comfortable and luxurious than staying in a 5 Star hotel. It has all the amenities of a 5 Star hotel but a much more relaxed atmosphere with intimate service!,Date of stay: March 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Sydney, Australia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yca0

It's styled in a more modern moroccan way which is a nice contrast to some of the more traditional riads we stayed in. The restaurant seems like a popular choice for visitors so expect outsiders around dinner time in the riad.

We were served with morrocan hand-wash snacks and mint teawhen we first arrived in the hotel. The hotel has a great location and easy to access every attractions. The Riad has security every night from 7pm to 1am he could walk guest to the souk if he is available. The best thing I found in the Riad was the phone provided to the guest it was fully charged and make us much easier to contact Riad whenever there is an emergency But the area is safe i was impressed by their hospitality. During my stay our housekeeper did amazing job the room was very clean and we were provided with turn down service every night. Breakfast was great and had great varieties( fresh juice fruits). The last night we booked hamman massage and dinner. It was exceptional hamman service spa massage was very relaxing dinner was very tasty( please make sure to reserve first the restaurant is always fully booked)    I have to mention one of employee( I forgot his name) he is dark and tall always working long hours he Is new to hotel about 3months ago I think he might be one of the managers he is always very patience to answer all the questions we had the last day he helped us to contact Ben Youssef college and let us know it is still in renovation it saved lots of time during our trip.

72 Riad Living,sarah p wrote a review Mar 2018,50,Girls trip,I was a little nervous about visiting Marrakech with a girlfriend however this was a brilliant trip. Riad 72 was more than I could have expected. The rooms were very comfortable and nicely furnished. The staff were so helpful and welcoming we found the offer of a mobile phone very reassuring and used the security guard to walk us to and from our restaurant on one evening. We did not feel threatened or unsafe however the restaurant was slightly out of the way and at 10pm it felt a little late to be walking alone as females silly to take unnecessary risks. We ate breakfast on the roof terrace which was very nice with fruit yogurt and sweet and savoury cakes and pastries each morning we also ordered an omelette to share at no extra cost which was very tasty. My only disappointment was dinner in the Riad it was rated as No 2 in Marrakech and sadly we found the meal disappointing and lacking in flavour it maybe the chef had an off day or was not on his normal game. The atmosphere of the restaurant which is in the main courtyard is super with running water and lovely candles I fear we may have built ourselves up too much for a super meal and were disappointed We had planned to go out with the chef on morning to purchase ingredients and cook a lunch time meal with him later in our trip but because of the evening meal we decided not too. Instead we had a Hammas Salt Scrub and massage which was absolutely brilliant and much more enjoyable I am sure than cooking and very reasonabley priced. Be prepared that this a complete body scrub and hair wash for about 50 minutes in total. I have never had anything like it before but a carried out so well by the staff in a super warm wet room with hot stones that you sat on my skin felt super soft for weeks. The massage afterwards lasted an hour and was fab too. Would highly recommended this if you have time during your stay.

I went there with my mother for a 3 night stay in Marrakech. We arrived in the evening and organised to have an airport transfer back to the riad where we were then greeted with a lovely welcome mint tea and hand washing with orange blossom water. Stefania the owner and manager of the Riad then came to greet us also and explained how the riad worked and gave us some tips on what to see around Marrakech.  We had booked our dinner there in advance for the night we arrived and it was delicious and fresh I would definitely recommend eating there at least once on the trip. The gorgeous fresh breakfast are also worth mentioning!  On our first full day of exploring we booked a guide for the medina through the riad which we found incredibly helpful for getting our bearings in the city.  Our room was one of the standard rooms in the new section of the riad and was absolutely perfect! Incredibly clean the design was modern but with a Moroccan touch. On the whole very comfortable a perfect place to return to after a long day of walking around the medina! (Special shout out to the super cozy fireplace in the courtyard also!)    All in all my mother and I could not be happier with the level of hospitality we have received while at Riad 72.

The taxi can't get next to the Riad so you are met by a member of staff who will walk you back to the Riad with your luggage which is about 5 mins walk. The Riad is in an excellent location about 10 mins from the souks but far enough away that it is peaceful and mentally you are escaping the hustle and bustle. A lovely greeting and our deluxe room with a roof terrace was super and like the pictures (The only negative like others have mentioned is that the shower seems to soak the floor). We ate in the courtyard the first night. Stefania was not around during our visit and we didn't get an introduction to the hotel where things were how we could get for example mint tea when we got back during the day. We managed to on our last day but getting the guy doing building work to call out. We did have a nice time and would stay again but we opted to go to other places instead of our hotel because of that. The Riad is what you picture when you think of a stay in Marrakesh.

The only issue for this class of property is the sound of the plumbing albeit this is not a rarity in Morocco.

If I have a tip for any traveller staying in the Medina it would be to have the Riad pick you up from the airport yes it may cost 50 Dirhams more less than £5 but it's worth every penny saves you getting lost and frustrated. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay which was for my husband's Birthday which I mentioned in my email to book the transport. Everything was wonderful about our stay from the moment we were collected at the airport and greeted by Stefania on our arrival to the day of departure. The rooms are lovely and the shower is great power shower with lashings of hot water. That thing about never enough coat hangers we had loads...the roof terrace is great for catching the sun and we had lunch served on the terrace one day. The staff are SO helpful we had a mobile just in case given to us nothing is too much trouble. Worth having a meal in the evening at the Riad we did twice and it was great.

The Riad is in mint condition and provides an oasis of tranquillity offers beautiful niches terraces and gardens to retreat to and our suite was always spotless clean. The staff was very friendly and made us feel at home immediately. Despite landing with delay we were awaited at the airport and guided to Riad 72 (otherwise very difficult to find!). Its location in the medina is perfect all spots are within 10 min walking distance. We got good support organizing an excursion breakfast was always excellent and dinner enjoyable.

The Riad itself is beautiful - a tranquil oasis away from the madness of the souks - and the staff made us feel comfortable looked after and as if nothing was too much trouble.    Our room was as nice as the pictures looked (the bathroom with an insanely huge and deep bath was my favourite in particular).    Breakfasts were delicious and varied every day and on our first night we had dinner served to us in the impossibly romantic private dining room at the back of the Riad - highly recommended.

The staff is beyond friendly and helpful. The restaurant is delicious. It truly was so lovely.    From the moment we arrived at the Marrakech airport we were greeted by a driver from Riad72. When we arrived near the property a staff member met us to carry our luggage to the property which is about a 3 minute walk from a busy intersection. The location of Riad72 was perfect -- just a few minutes walk away from the center of the bustling medina which was very nice to stay away from the center as it gets quite hectic. The property also has a security guard outside of the entrance of the riad at night which made us feel incredibly safe.    Our room was beautiful the amenities were fantastic and the hotel staff kept our room incredibly clean throughout our 4-night stay. There is also a spa on-site where you can experience a traditional hammam treatment that was great. The breakfast lunch and dinner was so delicious -- one of my favorite places we ate during our stay in Marrakech.

72 Riad Living,EllenLM wrote a review Dec 2017,40,"lovely property, but difficult manager","Riad 72 was our base for 3 nights. The property is lovely; all the restaurant housekeeping and other personnel were exceptional--except for the manager and unfortunately our experience with her left me with a dislike for this property.    We had communicated multiple times over the months leading up to our trip because I explicitly reserved a room with two beds--and confirmed that reservation. (I was traveling with my adult son and sharing a bed with him is just not something I want to do.) The manager greeted us with a breezy ""I have some good news and I have some bad news. Your room is not available but we have upgraded you to a lovely room that you will LOVE!!"" Well we didn't. She blew me off when I asked for a different room. We were tired and I caved.    The next day I spoke with her to see if we could get a room with two beds. She said ""But everyone LOVES the room I put you in!! It's special!! Families love it!!"" I had to really work to get her to stop telling me how wonderful the room was and repeated my request. Well as it turns out there was a room available with two beds. Why weren't we put there to begin with? Beats me.    Our third night we wanted to go to a Mediterranean restaurant for a mezze. She insisted there were no such restaurants in all of Marrakech. She said: ""Madame you are in Morocco. We serve Moroccan food. We do not have any restaurants with a mezze."" So we instead headed out to a purportedly hip restaurant. And ... the first 4 pages of the menu were a mezze. Labelled as ""mezze."" Why wasn't this restaurant recommended? Beats me.    There were other similar incidents. She kept talking over me and arguing with me maybe hoping to wear me down? I am giving the property a ""very good"" rating because of the other staff and the beauty of the facility.

72 Riad Living,mosmar2017 wrote a review Dec 2017,50,"Excellent hotel, excellent staff - style & design at it's best!",We stayed in Riad72 during our 5 day trip to Marrakesh in December. For us it was the perfect experience and a wonderful homebase in a bustling city.    Riad72 is located in a more quiet part of the medina still you can reach everything by foot. To the souks it is just a 10 minute walk to the new YSLaurant museum is is a nice 15 minutes walk...    The design of Riad72 is stunning - everything just fits. We actually spent quite a lot of time in the hotel - just enjoyed sitting in one of the 2 patios reading or on our roof terrace. You calm down as soon as you enter the door - relax-mode on.    The staff is exceptional. Everyone (!!!) is always there to help they organise trips or guides also on short notice they give recommendations. Stefania the manager has an answer to all your questions - and if not she finds one and comes back to you. You really feel they are taking care of their guests - it is more than what you usually experience in a hotel more personal but still so authentic.    We also had dinner several times at the hotel restaurant La table du Riad - what a pleasure! You sit in the quiet patio candles everywhere the food is fresh and delicious. We really enjoyed tasting us through the menu. We did not feel the need to try more restaurants outside if the good one is so close :)    Usually I do not really write recommendations but this time I really felt it necessary to tell the world of this fantastic place.

72 Riad Living,sathergate wrote a review Dec 2017,50,An oasis of calm and refinement,My wife and I spent four wonderful nights at the Riad 72 in late November and can't recommend it too highly. From the moment we stepped through the unprepossessing outer door into the first courtyard we felt cared for and relaxed. The ambiance is calm and uniformly aesthetic - both in the public spaces and in the rooms. We were upgraded to a junior suite in the new wing of the hotel which surrounds a second courtyard. Though only a couple of months old this new space preserves the traditional style and our room was exceptionally tasteful and welcoming - the tone throughout the Riad72 is good taste without fussiness or excessive decoration and the result is harmonious and soothing. The abundant greenery in the first courtyard makes it possible for many guests to have breakfast a drink or an excellent dinner in the same space while feeling somewhat secluded in one's own corner of the courtyard. There is also a lovely rooftop space - perfect for viewing the sunset and with vistas over the entire medina and to the silhouette of the Atlas mountains. The staff could not have been warmer or more solicitous. We also tried the haman and the massage service which were expert and revivifying.

72 Riad Living,Karen T wrote a review Dec 2017,50,Beautiful Riad with amazing staff and customer service!,"Love love love this Riad! My trip was seamless. From the airport pickup arranged by the Riad to the welcome from the friendly staff that included delicious Moroccan tea and cookies to Stefania and her team covering all you need to know about your stay the city and options for sightseeing. The room was beautiful and arranged per my request. It also had a beautiful bouquet of roses on the table!! The bathroom included a very large tub approximately 6 feet in length! A pleasure to soak in after a long day shopping in the medina. The location is perfect as it's just a few minutes walk from many of the sights and sounds of the markets. The rooftop offers gorgeous views of the city with several mosques in view. Hearing the call to prayer from the rooftop and standing and looking out over the city kicked the stay off just right. It's a mesmerizing feeling to just take in the sights and sounds as you begin your vacation. The room comes with a preprogrammed house cell phone that you can use should you get lost or need assistance from the staff as you explore the city. They also not only provide you with the key to your room but a key to the front door of the Riad. ""Our home is your home"" while here and everything you could ask for was provided. The rooftop offers lounge chairs to relax and enjoy the sun and a beautiful mafraj or sitting area to relax and unwind after a day on the town. The staff frequently checks on you to see if there is anything you need. From brining you wine snacks dinner or whatever you'd like to blankets and wraps as the night begins to chill. Breakfast is served each morning until 11 and includes fresh fruit yogurt coffee or tea breads pastries jams jellies honey and butter. Each day there was a new pastry to try. Your room also comes with daily bottled water fruit and a small candy snack at the end of day with turn down service. Excursions can be booked through the staff and they will arrange your taxi or transportation needed. They take care of it all and let you know when your driver has arrived. At that point one from the staff will walk you through the few small streets and alleys to Dar el Bacha to your awaiting transportation. I would highly recommend a stay at Riad 72 to anyone.

72 Riad Living,Ariana N wrote a review Nov 2017,50,Magical Experience in Marrakesh,Riad 72 went above and beyond our expectations. We arranged for airport transfers (210 dh) and the service was friendly and prompt. I highly recommend you do this at least being picked up from the airport as finding the Riad otherwise will be extremely difficult. It is a large property hidden in the streets of the Medina- walking distance from every sight you would want to see (we walked to Jardin Majorelle Bahia and Badi Palace Ben Youssef etc.) and also very easy to take a cab from. On arrival you are treated like royalty with Moroccan mint tea and a scented hand wash. The staff is attentive and friendly and Stefania is welcoming and helpful from the start. We only spent two nights there but Stefania and her team made us feel very welcome. We are a young couple (which in some places in Marrakech wouldn't be able to stay in the same room) but the Riad was more than welcoming. They even did a Hammam treatment for the two of us (highly recommend- very amazing experience in the convenience of the Riad. Would also recommend doing the massage afterwards as well). We stayed in a Classic room (the smallest/cheapest option) but was still an incredible space with a large comfortable bed beautiful carved wooden ceiling and an open bathroom. I have travelled all over the world and stayed at some of the best 5-star hotels and this easily compares. The intimate feel of the Riad makes the experience personalized and romantic. Stefania had lots of recommendations and make sure you feel really comfortable and safe- you are given a local phone just in case with numbers to the Riad. We also had the free breakfast there every morning (delicious selection of pastries fruit tea/coffee/fresh OJ) and dinner in the the restaurant (which was a romantic experience in itself). I cannot stress enough how amazing being in this Riad was. Marrakech is a very hectic but enchanting city and our trip wouldn't have been as successful and enjoyable had we not stayed here. Will definitely come back if I ever visit again.

72 Riad Living,CharlotteLogie wrote a review Nov 2017,50,A tranquil Oasis amidst the chaos of Marrakesh!,We stayed in this Road for 4 nights and had such a lovely time. You're greeted from the airport/bus station depending on how you arrive by taxi and taken into the city where a porter meets you and leads you down the winding Marrakesh alleyways. A massive wooden door in the wall opens up into a stunning Raid where you are greeted by Stephania and her wonderful team. You're given some Moroccan mint tea (of course!) and some yummy little homemade treats. We had a 'deluxe' room which was lovely and looked out to the internal courtyard (there are only 1 or 2 with the private balcony so not always guaranteed). The bed was huge and very comfortable and there is enough room for storage for a few days worth of clothes the shower and bathroom are lovely. All the staff are excellent the breakfasts are divine and for the first time in a long time we also booked an evening meal in our hotel rather than eating out every night and it was a great move. We booked the Tanjia (they need 6-8 hours notice) and it was simply fantastic and the internal gardens make for a great setting to have dinner.    I also booked to have a massage in the hotel. If you look on trip then there are 2 hamams that rate very highly and are close by but honestly I don't think you need to leave the Riad. The rates are more or less the same for an hours massage it was really excellent (and I speak as a professional masseuse) plus you get to leisurely stroll back to your room in your robe and collapse in a relaxed heap!!,Date of stay: November 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Nantwich, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CharlotteLogie

72 Riad Living,Nigel C wrote a review Nov 2017,50,An oasis of great service,"This was our first visit to Marrakech and the walk from the taxi drop-off point to Riad 72 felt like we had landed on a different planet. The noise the smells the shops and stalls and all the people !! Our luggage had been unloaded from the taxi into a hand car and one of the Riad 72 staff was weaving his way through streets and alleys. This was our first contact with the wonderful Riad 72 service.  The Riad itself is set behind a very heavy door in a quiet alley and entering it is like escaping to an oasis of peace after the bustle of the Medina. Even though we were very early and hours before check-in our room was ready and after an efficient and warm check-in process we were given a guided tour of the wonderful Riad 72. Our room was a good size with everything you need to relax and slow down. One major bonus - no TV in the room !! We had our first lunch served on the roof terrace by possibly the most efficient and courteous waiter ever !!!  When we finally got to leave the Riad to explore the Medina we were given an ""emergency mobile phone"" for the event that we got lost. A nice touch although Google maps was our saviour.  Breakfast is a treat - every morning a different variation on a theme with daily variants of bread and pastries fruit salad and so on. Eggs on request.

The welcome the staff the room the shower (wow) the breakfast the roof the location... all faultless. I absolutely loved it and recommend it to all visiting Marrakech. It’s location suits those who want to try equal measures of the old and the new Marrakech which I recommend most should and it becomes a fragrant oasis in the heart of it all when you’re there.    Stefania was incredibly welcoming and her team so helpful and friendly we wanted for nothing and got everything.

You follow him down several narrow alleyways to the door for Riad 72. You enter from the alley into a magical oasis. Lovely room. Great breakfast. Beautiful rooftop lounge and restaurant. Peaceful sunset with call-to-prayer drifting over the city. On top of all that Stefania is a lovely knowledgable helpful manager.

72 Riad Living,adrianne k wrote a review Nov 2017,50,Wonderful Experience at Riad 72,We loved our stay at Riad 72! What a beautiful and peaceful oasis. The courtyard of the Riad has a beautiful central water feature and lovely plantings. At night we enjoyed dinner there as it provided a candlelit retreat from the activities of the day (the riad is centrally located for seeing the medina palaces and medersa). We cannot say enough good things about the attention and kindness paid to us by the Riad 72 staff. Stephania Rachid Asma and others were wonderfully helpful and unfailingly kind. they went well above and beyond in helping us with anything that we asked. Our room was very comfortable and decorated in traditional Moroccan fashion. The room included a private roof-top balcony where we could have breakfast or dinner. This is top notch in our travel stays.,Date of stay: October 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Ventura, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/87adriannek

Just far enough away from the hustle and bustle of the souks it really was an oasis of calm and peace. Beautifully designed and decorated it felt high end and absolutely worth paying a little more for. Although we only stayed for 2 nights it was such a memorable time. Would HIGHLY recommend the hammam experience and the massage. The staff are lovely as well - best breakfast and evening meal we had in Morocco.

72 Riad Living,Anil R wrote a review Nov 2017,50,Miraculous in the center of it all,Located about a 10 minute walk from the Souks this hotel is one of the most unique experiences we have ever had  Upon arrival early in the afternoon we were greeted by our staff who gave us light refreshments and proceeded to promptly check us in. Note that streets aren’t typically marked clearly to there is lots of potential to get lost knowing this we were provided with a map and cellphone in case we got lost  The atmosphere inside the lobby is indescribable - I’ve never been to a hotel that smells so good!!!  It is so quit calm and serene in contrast with the bustle right outside  A taxi stand Is located about 350m away. We were really well looked after during our stay. The hotels and rooms are accessible by old school keys. Wireless is decent but who wants to stay inside anyways. There is a Mac desktop in the lobby located in the library- this is equipped with a printer. The staff replenishes your water and supplies and makes up the bed each time you are out  Our package included breakfast which is served from 0800. Breakfast consists of tea coffee fruit yogurt and some sort of pastry. It was different each day. Not buffet but definitely more than sufficient.  Each room is unique . This hotel has 2 suites and 6 rooms.  We stayed in the basic room which more than met our needs. Each room had 2 lounge chairs  - table several lamps and a very large bed the bathrooms had large marble tubs ( I’m over 6 feet tall and fit in !)  probably one of the largest bathtubs that I’ve seen  The highlight of this hotel is the staff which really bend over backwards to make your experience second to none.

All employes are incredibly friendly and courteous and make you feel like home.  After passing a day in the souks of marrakech coming back to the riad was like coming home to your calm living room.  There is no buffet for breakfast but the lovingly prepared breakfast that is served in the different courtyards is way better than any buffet.  We once had dinner in the ""table du riad"" which is on the rooftop with an amazing view. Ask for the menu in advance as everything is totally fresh and some dishes take up to 6 hours (!).

She is a lovely women always smiling and committed to ensure that we had a truly unique stay. Moustapha Rashid and Hassan where kind smiling and always went out of their way to help. The service is outstanding!    This is a high standard riad. It is lovely coming in from the busy Medina and feel the calm atmosphere. The roof terrace is lovely with a nice view over the city and the Atlas mountains. Dinner at the roof terrace can be recommended. It is very good situated in the Medina with walking distance to most of the things. The rooms are very nice. The staff changed towels sometimes twice a day and cleaned the room nicely. Clothes where even fold.  Another fantastic service gesture that made us feel safe throughout the stay were that we were given a cell phone. So if we got lost or needed anything we could give them a call.    Thank you so much everyone at Riad 72 for making our week in Marrakech a fantastic stay.

72 Riad Living,pattyaragon wrote a review Nov 2017,50,Beautiful stay- amazing service and food!,When we started planning our trip to Marrakech it took me a few weeks to decide where to stay. After so much research I decided to book Riad 72 for my husband our 3 yr old and my self.    We had a wonderful time in Marrackech and the Riad was just the perfect match. Beautiful and calm setting incredible clean amazing fresh food perfect location and the best was the service. The staff in the hotel its incredible they go beyond your expectation you dont find this level of service in any hotel. I felt very calm and confident with our boy around in the Riad and the staff was really nice with our little one.    We had a room facing the courtyard and we where able to put our toddler in bed and have dinner the two of us in the courtyard literally facing our room door!.. This was a plus for us.    The food... anyone visiting Marrakech should try this restaurant. Its fresh fine cuisine and very authentic. Beautiful presented and the ingredients at its best quality. Breakfast was something to look fwd every morning! as everyday you get something different!    Next time we visit Marrakech I wont take long to book as I know now the best place to stay!

72 Riad Living,randomseagirl123 wrote a review Oct 2017,50,The best place to stay!,We stayed in the suite for 5 nights and it was phenomenal. The riad and suite were beautiful! What really made this an unforgettable stay were the small touches. The hand wash and mint tea and pastries upon our arrival was a great way to start our holiday. Stefania showed us a map of Marrakech and talked us through places to visit. We were given a mobile phone with numbers of people at the Riad in case we got lost or just needed someone to escort us home. Staff were incredibly friendly and attentive (they remembered that I like coffee with my breakfast and still water for dinner!). We had the hammam and massage at the end our trip and it was quite literally the best thing ever.    The riad is located to many sightseeing spots and souks. It's hard to believe you're so close to the souks because the riad is so quiet. The riad is also only a 20 minute drive from the airport.    If you have never been to Marrakech before or have been many times I highly recommend staying at Riad 72.

Although just a short walk away from the main square the riad was very quiet and had a very relaxing atmosphere. When we left we were taking a trip to the desert then were returning to Marrakech. Stefanie assured us that she was just an email away and if we needed anything once we were back in the city she'd be happy to offer help or advice.

The riad is well located in the medina near the Dar El Bacha palace where there is a taxi stand that can take you easily where you want to go. It is also easy to walk into the souk and explore the narrow winding alleys and shops.    The rooms are very stylish and comfortable and the whole place is well kept and clean. The central courtyard is full of greenery and you can sit around little tables here and enjoy a cup of mint tea after a busy day of shopping and sightseeing. The roof top terrace is another wonderful place to relax and spend a few hours or to have a dinner. We ate twice at the riad and found the food very tasty and well presented.

We booked the Karma Suite and it was so amazing- it was a really big room and decorated so well! I was really proud of this find because I knew our room was so much better and bigger than a little one we would have gotten elsewhere and for half the cost! We also felt so special only having a few other rooms in the Riad.  The Riad was so beautiful and it was so relaxing to step in the door at the end of long days it was immediately relaxing! It was in such a great location which was close to all key medina attractions yet also very private quiet and safe. The service was excellent in particular cleaning service who did another full clean at turn down as well the best turn down we had all trip!  I highly recommend it in particular the suite especially if you are only in Marrakesh a few days and are not needing a pool.

72 Riad Living,whyshyme wrote a review Aug 2017,50,Arabian days at Riad 72,Last month I visited an intimate and welcoming hotel Riad 72. The hotel is a stunning paradise isolated from the outside hustle and bustle where relaxation is key and looking after number one is a top priority.    We wanted an authentic Moroccan experience and that is definitely what we got. When we arrived we were greeted with mint tea and traditional cookies. Immediately afterward we met Stefania a charming humorous knowledgeable highly experienced woman who simply did everything humanly possible to make our stay a stress free memorable experience.  Stefania gave us an entire briefing. She sat down with us asked us what we wanted from our trip and then helped us to plan our day to day activities including lunch and dinner reservations. We were given a cell phone so if we got lost or needed anything we could give them a call.    The hotel staff were lovely as well. Every single person who works at the Riad 72 excels in the commitment to ensure that you have a truly unique experience. From the moment you get up for breakfast to go to bed you are treated like royalty. They are like a constant ray of light and the sunshine that bathes your days in this beautiful place and wonderful country.    I had the pleasure of staying in a wonderful room a Classic Room with stucco and wood carving. Our room was on the 2nd floor and was nice & quiet. There was plenty of space for two people. The room was lovely with an open plan bathroom comfortable bed and most importantly air conditioning. It was well over 40 degrees during our staying there so the air con was very much needed. Mostly I enjoyed curling up in a super comfy king size bed with a book after a long day of shopping.    The hotel restaurant was lovely and served delicious food we only ate there once but would go back. Likewise breakfasts in the exotic green courtyard were fabulous and offered a fresh plentiful selection of foods each morning to cater for all tastes.    The solarium on the roof at Riad 72 was the perfect spot to start our day. They’ve thought of everything to make the rooftop an ideal place to unwind. Hanging out of the rooftop is something of a tradition in Marrakech and it’s a perfect way to pass the time when you need to get off your feet. I spent a couple hours every afternoon on the rooftop soaking up the sun and taking in the amazing calls to prayers for Ramadan that ring around the city.    Overall This was an amazing experience from the very first email to the moment we had to leave. However even when we left the Riad the assistance did not stop. We were accompanied to places of interest or to a taxi. We were able to contact them at any time via a phone that was provided to us by Stefania.    I left Riad 72 feeling relaxed at ease and ready to conquer the world once I got home. I will definitely be back very soon for a week of relaxation and isolation.,Date of stay: June 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/whyshyme

72 Riad Living,productionteams wrote a review Aug 2017,50,"Simplicity in design, mix of traditional Moroccan architecture and modern Italian",We spent a week in Marrakesh in a 1930s-inspired riad instead of a hotel. Riads traditional Moroccan houses with interior gardens are designed like a mini castle with multi-story high perimeter walls fencing off intruders. Windows are not faced outside to protect the residence’s privacy. The unique architecture also helps with air circulation to keep the heat out in the summer but warm in the winter.    Our riad is located in the medina near Dar el Bacha. Leading up to the riad we need to pass through narrow streets like a maze. The streets are filled with pedestrians bicycles and e-bikes with shoppers and merchants of many mom and pop stalls selling bread pastries produces butcher and handcrafts.    You can’t miss the riad’s entrance. First it’s a heavy over-sized metal door with layers of Arabic shapes. Second the door frame is shaped like the top of a mosque. Third there is a visible ledge you need to leap through similar to a traditional Chinese palace.  The entrance way has a fair amount of usage of expansion and contraction. Once you step in to the small foyer you can smell the Italian perfume then after a short corridor you are taken to an expansive welcoming interior garden with tall banana trees and water features in the courtyard. The area is decorated with many low lounge tables reminding you of its luxurious Moroccan style.    Looking down the floor is laid with the modern polish concrete floor and red lime stone polish concrete chair rail. Looking up you can see balconies a black painted wooden bridge and a black painted wooden bay window structure overlooking the interior garden. The black wood frame reminded me of Thai architecture.    We visited in June with a daily high of 45C (113F) but without the need of any air conditioning the interior garden is at least 10–15C (50–60F) cooler. With the courtyard’s water feature it’s an ideal spot to read a book enjoy a glass of rose or have a siesta!    Another remarkable design is noise reduction. Within the riad it’s impossible to hear any bike engine noise traffic or any chatter in the Medina. It’s as if the riad is hidden providing a secluded place to relax and enjoy Marrakesh.    Behind the palm trees are three small rooms with high ceilings the one on the left brings us to the tiny concrete room for Hammam a Moroccan sauna with a full body scrub. The room is dark but kept at a warm temperature. The one on the right is for a Swedish massage. The room in the middle is relaxation room to have Moroccan sweet mint tea with local cookies.

The people working there are so gracious friendly and helpful. The breakfast was delicious and it made us want to linger a little longer in the exotic green courtyard. We watched the sunset and the sunrise from our private rooftop overlooking the city. The mint tea and Moroccan cookies every afternoon made us feel like we were in another world and in a more relaxed and ancient time. The location is perfect for everything you can do in the Medina and in the new city.

72 Riad Living,Paul T wrote a review Jul 2017,50,A haven of calm in the center of Marrakech,My wife and I had 5 rooms in the Riad for a long weekend with our recomposed family of 4 daughters with their husbands / boy friends and grandson. Stefania and her very friendly team made us feel at home in a calm and private setting only minutes walk away from many of the Marrakech Medina's main sights.    Every morning we would wake to their lovely breakfast (each day bringing a new delicious offering). We would then go around Marrakech with the ease of returning to the Riad for our grandson's afternoon nap while other family members could continue their sightseeing. At the end of the day we would have a relaxing drink on the Riad's rooftop lounging area from where you can have magnificent views of the sunset over Marrakech. And one night we had a excellent typical Moroccan meal in the rooftop eating area knowing the our grandson was quietly sleeping in his room below.    Stefania's team were always at hand for our slightest need in this perfectly run haven of calm. Well done !!

72 Riad Living,Schuyler wrote a review Jul 2017,50,Look no further. Paradise found.,Heaven in the Marrakech medina. Look no further can't get much better than Riad 72. I have stayed at many luxury hotels but nothing compared to the hospitality and attention to detail that Riad 72 provides. From the moment your luggage is whisked from your car in a wagon you know you are in good hands. Stefania and the staff at Riad 72 make you feel at home. Luxury without pretension. Service attentive but not over bearing. The courtyard was fantastic both day and night. A place to unwind and truly feel relaxed. The complimentary breakfast served daily was varied and fantastic; fresh fruits breads pastries Moroccan pancakes jams coffee and fresh juice. The rooftop was stunning. The view was fantastic with sweeping vistas of the whole medina. Want a drink or lunch on the roof? No wish is too grand for the staff of Riad 72. I recommend lunch or dinner rooftop overlooking Marrakech. The room was modern yet comfortable with turndown both am and pm. Fresh roses fresh fruit bottled water what more could you ask for. Peaceful tranquil a respite from the excitenet of the city outside the Riad walls. The showers have excellent water pressure and abundant hot water. La Table du Riad (the onsite restaurant) was divine. I ate lunch once and three dinners. The service was exceptional. The cuisine was Moroccan with a modern twist; all beautifully served and carefully crafted. Rashid and Khalid were fantastic waiters and were most attentive. I highly recommend the lamb cooked for 6 hours in the farnatchi oven! The mint tea was out of this world amazing! The massage room and massage therapist was so relaxing and must do during your stay. Stefania (the hotel manager) went out of her way to make my stay in Marrakech seamless. She booked excursions arranged drivers and suggested places to visit (even helping book an overnight excursion in the mountains). The cooking class at the Riad is a MUST and Chef Mustapha was an excellent guide in the kitchen. It was such a rewarding experience. It was a true pleasure having the opportunity stay in such a special place. If you don't stay at Riad 72 you are missing out on a truly exceptional experience.

Upon check-in you are seated given some mint tea and some scented water to wash your hands. We were then taken to our wonderful room to settle in. The rooms are elegantly furnished and the bed firm but very comfortable. Our room had an enormous bath and the provided toiletries were naturally made and of the highest quality.    Breakfast every morning consisted of coffee/tea breads pastries fruit and yoghurt. It was delicious and everything was very fresh.    The staff were amazing. Nothing at all was too much trouble and it was almost like they had already anticipated your request and were just waiting for you to ask for it. Something which is very hard to get right.

They upgraded us to the most sumptuous and palatial room either one of us has ever seen. It was the perfect retreat after each hectic and somewhat stressful day fending off the guides in the souks (we are two women so we were particular targets unfortunately). The hammam (ritual bath where you are scrubbed within an inch of your life) and massage are STRONGLY recommended. Again the practitioners came in during the hardest part later afternoon of their Rammadan fasts.

72 Riad Living,Thomas O wrote a review Jun 2017,50,Exploring Marrakech,Riad 72 was an incredible experience. The property is gorgeous. The interiors and rooms are beautifully appointed and so comfortable. The courtyard is an oasis as is the rooftop lounge. What an experience it is to return to the riad after an exciting day of taking in the souks and the energy of the medina. Perfect location for the avid shopper. I think though that above all the best part of Riad 72 is the incredible staff. Stefania is so pleasant accessible and knowledgeable. Our breakfasts were truly memorable due in part to the wonderful food but also because of the wonderful service. And dinner at the Riad is not to be missed (rooftop of course). Cocktails at dusk were also super fun and once again the most pleasant service imaginable. I have to also mention our porter who seemed to be at the Riad 20 hours every day and was so helpful. Also the gentleman providing security was a wonderful person super sweet and never hesitated to be of service.

72 Riad Living,IannisausWien wrote a review Jun 2017,50,Truly the only place to stay in Marrakech,"I just cannot say enough about Riad 72. It is one of the finest hotels in which I have ever stayed.    My flights and travel getting to Marrakech were utterly miserable. However after 10 minutes at the Riad I forgot all about it. The atmosphere décor and most importantly the staff wiped every thought of the previous day out of my mind. I was immediately struck by a sense of calm and welcomed with hospitality I've rarely if ever experienced in a hotel before.    Riad 72's location is ideal. It is literally at the base of the souk but still a short walk to the main square if you want to bypass the souk altogether. While the mazes of alleys and streets of Marrakech are often confusing getting to Riad 72 is very easy.    Speaking of the maze that is Marrakech and its souk I should point out that Riad 72 provides each guest with a cell phone with pre-loaded numbers for different staff members of the hotel. If you get lost call the Riad and someone will come to find you and lead you home. If you need a ride call the Riad and they'll send someone. If there is any problem while you are out in the city you can use your phone and call the Riad. They also have a hotel guide who will walk you around the city if you are unsure of where you are going or if you don't want to walk around alone at night.    The building itself is a dream. While very traditional with carved woodwork deeply carved tiles arches and railings it also has a chic modern atmosphere. The subdued lighting at night and recessed sitting rooms and tables off the courtyard provide privacy and a sense of having the place all to yourself.    My room took my breath away. I booked one of the smallest if not the smallest of rooms. When I opened the door and saw the room I actually thought they made a mistake. There was nothing small about it. Incredibly high ceilings with heavily carved woodwork and tiles. Shelf and counter space abounded all around the room which is good for travelers. The closet was very large and fit all my clothes and empty luggage with lots of room to spare. A modern bathroom with plenty of open area cabinetry space and shelf space was located toward the back. The bed was so comfortable and the room so quiet I slept like the dead. I would recreate the room at home if I could. Utterly unlike any hotel room I have ever had.    Then there is the rooftop. It's expansive with two large sitting areas and a space with lounge chairs for getting some sun. We had breakfast up on the roof. The setting and fare made it hard to leave breakfast and move on with the day. We also had dinner on the rooftop which was spectacular in its presentation and setting. Which brings me to the food ...    I was fortunate to have two dinners at Riad 72. From what I learned their restaurant is noted as a place one must go and I see why. The food was just wonderful from appetizers to dessert. While they do have traditional fare they also offer international choices.    The second dinner I had on the rooftop was a dinner for 27 people. As I mentioned before the setting the presentation and the atmosphere was magical. The food was prepared and served flawlessly. So much so that I had to have a second serving which I never do. I don't know how they timed and served everything so well.    Which brings me to the staff. I'm afraid to even write this part of my review for fear that I shall not do them justice. I can't explain how I felt an utter sense of welcome and ""home"" during my stay at Riad 72.    Nothing I asked for was ever a problem. Service was fast efficient and always with a smile. I waited and wanted for nothing. They were patient and always went above and beyond what I expected. One day I had a very bad day out in the city. I got to the door and was greeted with a smile and I felt like I was home. Again the misery of the day was wiped away by the staff within minutes.    We had a large birthday party on Saturday night. Our group of 27 people from all over the world descended upon the Riad. The staff made it seem like we were a party of four. They made taking care of us serving dinner and granting every one of our wishes seem so easy. I should add that our party lasted until 4:30 in the morning. Of course it was no problem for them - or so they made it seem.    While I wouldn't recommend staying up until 4:30 am if you have a special event with a large group of people I URGE you to arrange a rooftop dinner at Riad 72. It will be a night you will never forget. Trust me on this.    In short the only place to stay in Marrakech is Riad 72.    On the day I left as the staff walked me to the door to say goodbye my heart ached a bit. I suppose that pretty much sums up my opinion of Riad 72. You will love the Riad you will love its food and you will love the people who make it a home.

72 Riad Living,Brian C wrote a review May 2017,50,Couldn't Be Happier With Our Stay,Riad 72 blew away our expectations. Yes there are nicer accommodations but for the cost we were very pleased.    Pros:  - Staff are amazing! The service was on par with some of the leading hotels in the world that we have visited. Kind and always went out of their way to help even when the requests were probably out of their job description.  - Location in the medina was great. Far enough outside the craziness to have some relaxation but within walking distance of everything.  - Providing a local mobile phone to use in a pinch was a great help (though we didn't need it luckily).    Cons:  - No pool. This was almost a deal-breaker when booking and on a hot day after walking around it would have been perfect.  - Other reviews mentioned noise from other guests which we didn't find to be too much of a distraction. Even with a room that opened up to the courtyard where there was a lot of foot traffic. Maybe it was just a quiet week.  - It is very difficult to find with little to no signage so you have to be a bit adventurous and remember where to go. Staff and security are always there to help though.  - We wished the kitchen was open later but understand they can't wait around all night with only a few guests.  - Depending on the time of day and how many people are staying in the riad it can take a bit to find a staff member. We either waited called or just knocked on the kitchen door to find someone in a pinch. During normal hours there was always someone walking around however.,Date of stay: May 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Chicago, Illinois",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BJC12345

72 Riad Living,Familyofive5 wrote a review May 2017,50,Outstanding service,Just read two recent reviews and am wholeheartedly in agreement with Jo H that this is probably one of the best managed Riads. With prior notice they will collect you from the airport and walk you and your luggage to the door. Rooms come with a mobile which you can use to call the Riad if you get lost need security etc. Stefania is very helpful and has chosen great staff. I chose a deluxe room one up from standard which gave us lots of space and a huge bath. On the first night I was woken by the call to prayer from a nearby mosque but didn't hear it on the subsequent night. I think probably hard to avoid in the old town and copious amounts of alcohol before bed always helps... I would definitely stay again.

72 Riad Living,Jo H wrote a review May 2017,50,An amazing choice for a special birthday surprise,On recommendation from a close friend and the excellent TripAdvisor reviews I decided to book Riad 72 as a special surprise for my (young) husband.    Turns out it was the best decision I could have made!! From start to finish our time there was amazing. Initially I booked a standard room but decided to upgrade to one of the suites. It was spectacular.    The room was huge and the decor stunning. The bed was wonderfully large and comfortable. If you are partial to a long soak in the bath this place doesn't disappoint. Not all the rooms have bath's but the one's that do are amazing!! Our suite had a huge square bath that surprisingly didn't take too long to fill!!    We were given a phone (no charge to use when contacting the numbers in the contact list) to keep with us during our time in Marrakech and told if we needed any help to call the pre programmed numbers any time. As the Riad was just off a couple of side streets and inaccessible by car you had the option to call the lovely security guard and he would walk you back round the corner from the taxi drop off to the Riad. To be honest we felt so safe we didn't need to ring him but he was so lovely we rang him so we could chat and then tip him when we arrived back at the Riad!!    The Riad has a lovely quiet roof terrace which we used on our arrival and one early evening. We sat and read and enjoyed the quiet.    The roof terrace also has a small dining area (5 or 6 tables) where you can enjoy breakfast or dinner. We didn't take an evening meal at the Riad but we did have breakfast there one day and it was lovely and quiet with stunning views.    The other 2 mornings we took breakfast in the courtyard which was really great. Breakfast for us was perfect and beautifully presented. Breakfast is light but filling. Do not come expecting a big greasy fry up!!! Every day they make a different style of pancake served with a different bowl of finely sliced fruit (one day Galia melon one day water melon and one day nectarine) and a serving of natural yoghurt. This is served alongside a selection of 3 different breads and patisseries with beautiful Conserves. You are also offered a choice of fresh eggs which I must say are seasoned and cooked perfectly. Fresh orange and coffee (ask for fresh coffee) are served. It was such a pleasure to eat breakfast without the waft of greasy fried meat!!    The Riad is in the Medina (within the perimeter walls) but not too close to the bustle of the market. Once you have sorted your bearings - not so easy in Marrakech as nothing is actually straight and roads don't seems to have names - there is a straight road that takes you straight into the Souk. About a 15 minute walk. We also walked to the Mellah district and spent a morning looking round there.    All in all a brilliant choice. We will definitely be returning.    Stafania Medhi and the team are absolutely amazing.

72 Riad Living,derekfromvan wrote a review May 2017,50,Riad 72 is the best!,Our stay at Riad 72 was amazing to say the least. The Riad is a historical building and is in prime location just outside the craziness of the souks and center square. The Riad is private beautiful and truly first class (really the nicest place I have stayed anywhere in the world). The management staff of Stefania and Mehdi are very approachable and helpful with providing recommendations on day excursions as well. The staff are the best all very nice. It made our trip special being able to talk to them and learn about their lives and experiences in Morocco and have given us a desire to return to Morocco and experience other cities and towns throughout the country.    Side note if you go to Marrakech a trip to Ourika valley is a must. Beautiful Berber villages along the river and amazingly nice and genuine Berber people. Do all your shopping in Ourika as the goods are genuine hand made and much less expensive than Marrakech (where most of the goods are Chinese/Indian machine made).,Date of stay: May 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Vancouver, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/derekfromvan
72 Riad Living,otk25 wrote a review May 2017,50,True home in Marrakech,Excellent location. Walking distance to everything you want to see in Medina and outside.  Once you are in Riad it’s easy to find it. When arriving the Riad sends a guardian to carry your luggage and walk you to the Riad. The Riad also provides a cell phones to guests with pre-programmed numbers to call for assistance. Not as I personally needed it but I am impressed how thoughtful they are in making guests feel safe and comfortable. Narrow deserted derbs of Medina are not really dangerous but might feel intimidating for some travelers especially after dark so they will send a guardian to accompany you to the Riad from the nearest taxi stand if you come late at night. Never even heard about such service!  Comfort of the room. Although I was staying in probably the cheapest one it was great: extremely comfortable and clean. Not to mention tasteful decoration of the room and bathroom.  Piece and quite of the Riad. Once you stepped in you are in the different world. After spending a day in very noisy Marrakech I did enjoy a quiet time with a glass of wine in the courtyard or rooftop terrace. Highly recommend Moroccan wines especially “grey wine”.  Excellent breakfast. Moroccan pancakes were my favorite and I would stay there just for them.  Very very personal service. You are called by your first name from the moment you stepped in to the very sad moment when you have to depart. Stefania and her team are example for friendliness and excellent service.  TIP TO GUESTS: Prior to arrival Riad 72 will send you a map with instructions where to drop you ask to call them 5 minutes prior to arrival. They will send a uniformed guardian with the cart marked “Riad 72” who will know your name. Stick to the instructions. DO NOT accept any offers at taxi stand to accompany you to the Riad from anybody who claimed to be sent by “Riad 72”. They will accompany you to the Riad and then quite aggressively demand “a tip” for fraudulently offered service. You don't need that. Or even better book you pick up with Riad 72.,Date of stay: April 2017,Trip type: Traveled solo,Toronto,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/otk25

72 Riad Living,Peter G wrote a review Apr 2017,50,Very Relaxing and Excellent Service!,We had a seamless stay in Riad 72 from the welcome to the departure. We were picked up and taken to the Riad without any issues able to check in to our room early which was stunning (we had one of the suites). The room was spotlessly clean and having a mobile phone for emergencies is a great idea.  Every morning we had an amazing breakfast which we could have on the roof top if weather permitted they did something slightly different every morning and was quite refreshing not having a buffet.  The Riad organised a bike tour with 'Insiders' and a great cooking course in the Riad everyone was so friendly and personable!

72 Riad Living,kktaylor03 wrote a review Apr 2017,50,So Fantastic!,We recently stayed at Riad 72 and were blown away! We were taken care of by some of the nicest people you will ever meet - super accomodating warm and friendly. Riad 72 is like a hidden oasis - peaceful clean modern warm comfortable and romantic! The rooms are spacious gorgeously decorated and super comfortable. AC great bathrooms great water pressure and soft sheets. There are so many neat areas to relax at the Raid (both on the main level and on the roof). They also had a wonderful spa which we didn't partake in but I've heard nothing but amazing things about the services they perform. Don't be offset by your walk from the taxi drop-off to the front door of the Riad as it is situated within the middle of the Median. It may seem overwhelming as they lead you down small alley ways but well worth it when you walk through the front door. It's like another world.    We were greeted by the wonderful Khalid and Aziz both of whom are on another level in terms of customer service. So polished respectful and accommodating. I'm not sure I've ever stayed somewhere where they were so genuinely concerned at whether you are comfortable and happy with your accommodations. It was so refreshing.    We had the option of eating our meals in the gorgeous seating area inside or on the roof (choose the roof every time!). In the mornings we were greeted by Asma who is so sweet and friendly. During our days we would also run into Rashid who again was the nicest man!    Stephania (the manager) was super gracious and helped us set up some day trips (we highly recommend the Atlas Mountains and Essaouira). She was super helpful in showing us where to go within the Medina as well as introducing us to some hidden gems. She gives you an easy to read map that really does help you get from A to B b/c the Medina can be overwhelming. Thanks to her tip we found some incredible rugs!    The food is delicious! They provide breakfast every morning - fresh bread and pastries fresh squeezed orange juice jams and eggs made to order. They also have lunch and dinner available (both of which we took advantage of). Everything was delicious - true authentic Moroccan fare!    Turn down service twice a day and free wi-fi - they really go out of their way to make you feel at home!    We just can't say enough great things and would highly recommend Riad 72 to anyone traveling to Marrakech and we will definitely be returning!,Date of stay: April 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Los Angeles, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kktaylor03

72 Riad Living,Emily U wrote a review Apr 2017,50,Home away from home in Marrakech!,My boyfriend and I just spent three nights at Riad 72 and couldn't have asked for a better experience. The riad is a beautiful oasis conceniently located in the Medina. The central courtyard is a lovely place to enjoy mint tea or a meal but the rooftop was our favorite spot to take in the views of the city. We enjoyed our breakfast and pre-dinner wine each day on the lovely rooftop terrace. Our room was equally lovely- lots of space large comfortable bed fresh flowers and a huge bathtub.    The staff at Riad 72 could not have been any nicer. Everyone knew our names provided excellent service and really made us feel right at home. The breakfast each morning was the perfect way to start our day. Delicious pastries and various spreads as well as and an egg dish of our choice and great coffee and tea were offered. We also ate dinner at the Riad our first night there and the food was superb. We wanted to try other restaurants for dinner for the two additional nights we were there and the staff was very helpful in providing excellent recommendations (although the food at Riad 72 was just as good if not better than the food at those other restaurants).    We would highly recommend Riad 72 to anyone traveling to Marrakech!,Date of stay: April 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Boston, Massachusetts, USA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/276emilyu
72 Riad Living,Robert G wrote a review Apr 2017,50,Top service and an intimate oasis of calm in the Medina,We just returned from a week at the Riad 72 – our first trip to Marrakech. The Riad is in a fantastic location near to Dar el Bacha which is one of the more elegant sections of the Medina but equally close to be able to walk to all destinations and for exploring the souks and the main square.    Stefania and her team at the Riad were amazing. Before arriving we exchanged emails with Stefania who made sure we were met at the taxi drop-off and escorted to the Riad as it is down a series of very narrow small alleys (but with the benefit of permanent on-street security to make you feel very safe at any time of day or night). We also booked our first meal at their in-house restaurant (Le Table du Riad). Do take up the ability to have Stefania email you the menus so you can pre-order as the food is by far the best we had on our trip and there are a number of dishes where the chef needs 6-10 hours notice as all is made to order.    With Riad 72 it is all about the details. There is a beautiful central courtyard with alcoves and places to sit amongst lush vegetation. We stayed in one of their smaller ‘classic’ rooms which was perfectly fine – tastefully decorated with loads of original features and accessed off the open walkways around the courtyard at first floor level. We had a chance to see a few other rooms and all were equally beautiful. The Riad also has most fabulous roof terrace that sits slightly above the surrounding houses and provides an extraordinary panoramic view of the city and the surrounding Atlas Mountains. It is a great place to come back after a hectic day in the Medina to sit and have a drink and watch the sun set (and was also wonderful for breakfast).    The Riad provides you with a mobile phone so you can ring them at any time and if needed one of their staff will come and collect you. We actually had them escort us to and from a restaurant deep within the Medina as it was otherwise quite difficult to find. This was a real help to us and seemed no trouble for them.    They serve a lovely fresh breakfast every morning (either in the courtyard or on the terrace) – and the ladies serving were incredibly friendly and helpful. We also ended up eating dinner here 3 times during our stay as the food was so good – traditional with a fresh modern twist and served in such an intimate and relaxing environment. All the staff were great and really made you feel like you could treat the Riad as your home. We send special thanks to Rashid and Khalid who took such good care of us.    Stefania also organised a day trip for us with a driver and guide to the Atlas Mountains – including a modest trek between 2 villages (including waterfalls) followed by a traditional Berber lunch at the Kasbah Toubkal (with breathtaking views of the tallest mountains in the range). They offer various other trips to suit all tastes and it was a real treat of the break.    We are generally quite picky about where we stay and Riad 72 was a true oasis of luxury and calm and we very much look forward to coming back.,Date of stay: March 2017,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z2185LBrobertg
72 Riad Living,madcapsules wrote a review Mar 2017,50,Oasis in the Desert,I booked Riad 72 after seeing it consistently rank among the top recommended Riads on various travel blogs and websites. Shortly after making my booking I emailed the hotel regarding an airport pickup on the date of our arrival. I received a swift response from the hotel manager with a fair quote. I also inquired on various activities available since we had an open schedule in Marrakech.    After exiting the arrivals at the airport our driver was there waiting for us. He shuttled us to the Hyundai mini van and pointed out various sites on the way to the Riad. Once at the drop off point another hotel employee met us with a cart to collect the luggage and guided us through the tiny streets and alleyways to the Riad.    Once at the Riad we were seated in the courtyard and offered some mint tea. The staff greeted us by name and collected additional details. They then gave us a tour of the Riad that culminated in a nice view from the rooftop.    Our booking was for a Classic room that was very spacious and included high ceilings. We had a queen bed. Toiletries are all locally sourced and included bars of black olive soap. An AC was in the room. One of the unexpected features was that we were provided with a brick phone that served as a hotel/room phone should we need anything as well as a source to which we could make local calls from. This could be used throughout your stay and taken out of the Riad. We had daily room cleaning as well as turndown service. We were provided with bottled water daily. We had excellent sleep although we did wake up a few times during the early morning due to the call to prayer over the loudspeakers across the city. This will happen anywhere you stay in Morocco and not a fault of Riad 72.    Breakfast is included with the stay and changed daily. We had various pastries bread with an assortment of jams butter and honey scrambled eggs and crepes.    We were also shown an activity book. We ultimately did not book activities through the riad but we appreciated the gesture. Lunch and dinner is available at the Riad. The riad could also convert one of the courtyard rooms into a hammam with advance notice.    The riad also had a security guard at night who watched the entrance of the riad. We always felt safe throughout our stay.    Throughout our stay we were continually greeted by the staff by name. This was definitely unexpected for me in Morocco and a level of service that I appreciate.    Our checkout experience was a breeze and they even held our bags for us for a few hours.    The Riad itself is located about 10-15 minutes walk from Jemma-el fnna. Taxis are about a 2-3 minute walk from the riad where the local roads meet the main road.    In summary we thoroughly enjoyed our stay with Riad 72. The service was top notch and the experience was one to remember. Although Riad 72's prices are higher than other riads in Marrakech the level of service is unmatched. I give my full recommendation to Riad 72 for anyone interested in making their Marrakech trip a memorable one.,Date of stay: March 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Honolulu, Hawaii",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/madcapsules

72 Riad Living,mouldyoldie wrote a review Mar 2017,50,Long weekend in Marrakech,We very much enjoyed staying in this quiet small Riad in Marrakech. It was right in the centre of town and very easy to walk to many of the sites. Regrettably we were only there for a weekend but we were extremely well looked after. The night we arrived we chose to eat dinner on the roof and were personally served by a waiter our absolutely delicious meal ( we had ordered in advance). The breakfast each day offers a cooked surprise with fresh fruits and pastries serviced in the courtyard. Our room was extremely spacious with a high domed ceiling with extraordinary wooden panelling and we were able to chose our own soap for our bath and shower an added nice touch. We were given a mobile phone with useful numbers on so that we could call for help if we got lost. We were confident we wouldn't but we did! The souk looks very different at night when all the shops are closed. We were relieved to see our rescuer arrive on his bicycle and escort us back. Marrakech itself is a very interesting place and I would definitely recommend Riad 72 as a place to see it from.,Date of stay: February 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Queenstown, New Zealand",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mouldyoldie
72 Riad Living,Darryl_Ware wrote a review Mar 2017,50,Amazing Hotel,Can't praise this hotel enough from the onset the staff were super friendly helpful and welcoming. The hotel was beautiful with so many little touches. Our room was exceptional and very clean and atmospheric ! The breakfast and lunch were outstanding sadly as we only stayed for a couple of days we chose to eat outside of the hotel. I suspect we missed out by doing so had we stayed longer I would have definitely eaten at their restaurant. The guide we arranged through the hotel was perfect and we also sampled a Hammam with massage at the hotel and this again was outstanding !!! The Riad 72 is situated perfectly and we were able to walk to all the attractions which was fab and a great experience !! Throughout our time the staff were friendly very helpful yet unobtrusive and when at the airport and I realised I had left my phone in the room Stephanie (Hotel Manager) responded swiftly to help an organised a taxi to bring my phone to the airport !!! Which I was so grateful for. I would rate this hotel an 11/10 would strongly recommend it to friends and family and would have no hesitation in returning when next in Marrakech thank you Riad 72 for a wonderful break !!!,Date of stay: February 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Buckingham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Darryl_Ware

72 Riad Living,Quiescence wrote a review Feb 2017,50,First class hospitality. Amazing staff and location. Not to be missed.,I don't do reviews. This is in fact my first review prompted by the sheer quality of our experience at Riad 72.    The Riad is beautifully conceived a very welcoming with an air of class and refinement. It really was a lovely place to come back to after days spent exploring the medina. Every single member of staff was so friendly and welcoming. I was practising my terrible french as often as possible it felt like being among friends. It was great to meet all of you! First class hospitality as the title says.    This particular Riad is perfectly situated within the Medina of Marrakech. Blissfully quiet at night and walking distance to everything although if you do need a taxi it's only 3 minutes walk from the Riad.    Stefania was amazing throughout and helped us out at every turn. We were made to feel very comfortable in our surroundings and had the entirety of Marrakech explained to us and were given an incredibly useful map of the place with summaries recommendations restaurants everything you could possibly need in your pocket! We were recommended dozens of places to go and I'm sure there are plenty more. Stefania took us through everything whenever we needed it and organised and amazing private trip for my wife an I to the Ourika Valley within the Atlas Mountains. Quite fantastic. Mindboggling. Awesome. And that's just one of the options!  We are guaranteed to come back there's so much to see and to do in Marrakech. Stefenia has created an amazing environment from which to start the adventure. From the comforting aroma of sweet figs in the entrance to the local mobile phone pre-loaded with useful contacts should we need any assistance. I thought that was a really great touch. When we first arrived within moments our bags had been swept away to the room chairs drawn up and we were sitting in front of the banana trees sipping mint tea with biscuits accompanied by the sound of running water. Stefania had arranged a great dinner for us for after we had made ourselves comfortable (despite our very late arrival). It was a really great way to start the trip. Really made to feel at home from the very beginning.    I could say good things about our time in the Riad alone for hours and for days about Marrakech. I'll probably add to this review over time... I can't say enough good things about the whole experience. Thank to Stefania and all her staff for a truly memorable anniversary experience. I would highly recommend Riad 72 to anyone.

72 Riad Living,Robesi wrote a review Feb 2017,50,Tranquility in the hustle and bustle of the Medina,My wife and I booked this Riad for our 4 night stay in Marrakech after our usual TripAdvisor research. Our expectations were very high and we were delighted that they were more than exceeded. We received a warm and informative welcome from Stefania over some Mint Tea and Moroccan biscuits in the beautiful relaxed surroundings of the courtyard. This high level of friendly and attentive service was maintained through our visit by all the very personable staff and Stefania remained the perfect hostess throughout our stay.    The setting of the Riad is perfect being within the back streets of the Medina but in a quiet area and a short and easy walking distance to all the sites. It’s reached by a few small winding streets and felt perfectly safe at night. There is always a security guard at the main door and the hotel provides you with a personal mobile phone with a range of pre-programmed numbers if you get lost and would like to be escorted back or need any help. We never had to use this but it was a great to know that this contingency was available.    The interior of the Riad was simply stunning; elegantly and traditionally decorated and furnished with a beautiful large open air courtyard with banana trees and a sumptuous traditionally decorated red dining room. There is also a wonderful roof terrace where you can soak up the sun or dine if you wish. We had requested the deluxe room with a private terrace and it was superb being simply beautifully and warmly decorated very comfortable and large enough for our needs with ample storage and a safe. The bathroom was great and the complimentary luxury spa toiletries were of the highest quality. The room had some stairs up to its own personal sun terrace with 2 comfortable sun loungers and a table and chairs and even its own outside shower. A welcome pack of fruit was left for us on our arrival and each night there was a turn down with 2 bottles of water.    Breakfasts were served in the courtyard but could also be served on the roof terrace (although when we stayed the mornings were a bit chilly). The breakfasts were simple but with the highest quality local produce with fresh fruit orange juice and yoghurt a different dish each day (such as pancakes omelettes etc.) and local bread cakes and soft cheese. We also ate in the restaurant for Dinner and the service and relaxed ambiance was so wonderful after a full day exploring the hustle and bustle of the Medina. The Moroccan salads and slow cooked dishes (which have to be ordered 6 hours in advance) were delicious (especially the lamb) and we sampled the local Moroccan beers and wine.    We spent 2 full days exploring Marrakech and on the 3rd day booked a trip to the Atlas mountains through the hotel which I can also highly recommend. We travelled up to Immil (which takes about 1.5 hours) stopping at a few interesting places and after a 2.5 hour trek in the mountains had lunch at the Kasbah Du Toubkal which was a fabulous place to soak in the sun and views.    On our last day we booked a Hamman and massage in the Riad and it really is a tremendous and highly recommended experience and a great way to finish off our relaxing break. As we booked this at 11am for 2 hours on our last day and we were in a quiet time we were kindly offered to check out late so we could leave directly for the airport at 3pm. Again it was such great service and an extra 2 hours in the sun on our terrace with a book following our Hamman was the perfect way to finish our break.    Riad 72 is a delightful comfortable and luxurious boutique Riad away from the hustle and bustle of the rest of the Medina but close enough to get everywhere by foot a real oasis of tranquillity in what can be a very busy city. Stefania and all the staff clearly pay a huge premium on providing a personable and warm customer service and nothing is too much trouble for them.,Date of stay: February 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Robesi

72 Riad Living,mchhughes wrote a review Feb 2017,50,A truly magical place,Beautiful and stylish interiors personable staff and all-round fantastic service what's not to love at this wonderful gem located in the beating heart of the Medina?    Everything at Riad 72 exudes a feeling of warmth and attention to detail from the way they serve their food and greet their guests to the stunning simplicity by which the hotel is decorated. The moment you step into Riad 72 a warm welcome from Stefania and the staff makes you feel comfortable and at ease. This was especially appreciated after a long journey and an unfortunate incident of lost check-in luggage.    The food at the in-house restaurant is especially delicious and shouldn't be missed. I'd recommend their Moroccan salad selection and the slow cooked meals which should be ordered at least 6 hours in advance; the lamb is to die for. The breakfast spread is also fantastic and they provide little variations for each day of the week such as different kinds of pastries and fresh fruit.    A mention for the staff must not go amiss particularly for Khalid Aziz and Stefania who stood out during our 5-day stay and not only provided stellar service but were particularly charming and affable and made our stay a memorable one.    If you're looking for a comfortable and luxurious stay in Marrakech but want to avoid the high-priced grandeur of the Mandarin Oriental or the Four Seasons then Riad 72 is your best bet.,Date of stay: January 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mchhughes

72 Riad Living,Bitternwatcher wrote a review Jan 2017,40,Stylish Riad in the Medina,Riad 72 is a stylish boutique hotel within easy reach of the souks in the Medina ideally located for a short stay in Marrakech. The hotel porter accompanies you down little alleyways to the Riad where you enter a beautiful courtyard with a water feature and huge banana trees - when you go through the door it is like entering Dr Who's tardis. This interior courtyard offers visitors a wonderful sense of calm after the hustle and bustle of the Medina. Our room was spacious and stylish but our one disappointment was the shower: we didn't manage to get hot water during our three day stay (it was either completely cold or tepid) and the shower seemed to drain towards the rest of the bathroom rather than down the drain requiring considerable mopping up. Apart from this everything was perfect. Service was impeccable the roof terrace where meals can be served was beautiful. We had several meals in either on the roof terrace or in the opulent downstairs dining area which were good. Breakfasts which we had in the courtyard were also very good.  The Riad should be singled out above all for the excellent team who run it.

We could not have been happier. The location is excellent - down a quiet and hidden lane but close to the everything. Access was very easy - the staff was happy to meet us at the taxi drop off point and get us settled in. We liked being a bit away from the main square and the associated noise and chaos but just a 10-15 min walk away.    The riad itself was lovely with a tremendous amount of space for so few rooms. There were nice quite public areas a hammam massage room a great roof terrace (a bit cold however when we were there!) and a quaint lounge that turned into the restaurant in the evening. Our dinner here (reviewed separately) was also delicious and highly recommended for a try!    The room was stunning. We were upgraded to a very large suite with incredible architectural detail.

72 Riad Living,Lisa L wrote a review Dec 2016,50,"Very clean & peaceful space, amazing Riad, lovely staffs,",I stayed there with my mom for 5 nights and we just loved everything they offer. This must be the best Riad in Marrakech - very authentic & peaceful that you feel like you're in another world yet still modern and functional you would never find anything uncomfortable. The room is super clean and their rooftop is amazing.    Their food - both breakfast and special menus for lunch & dinner - is fantastic.    The streets from Medina to the Riad 72 are very very safe and the the nearest street even has its own security guard 24/7 for tourists.    The staffs (including the lovely manager Stefania) are a.m.a.z.i.n.g. We were very well taken care of and they are really there to help guests with heart. Btw the staffs even gave us a mobile phone with a local number so we can call them if we get lost in the countless / nameless streets.    Anyway if you want to experience a real life of Marrakech this is the place. If I visit Marrakech again I'll definitely come back to Riad 72 for sure!,Date of stay: December 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hyungil2016

72 Riad Living,Laura B wrote a review Dec 2016,40,"Lovely modern unique property, great foyer, nice staff",Riad 72 was definitely beautiful with interesting decor great old foliage with a nice veil of hospitality overall. It is clean and well appointed. However because I had just stayed 4 nights at a different place I had really high standards and expectations for hospitality. For example when the owner sends a welcome email says they would love to have you for a welcome dinner they have an onsite restaurant and they of course charge you for this so the welcome dinner isn't so much a welcome dinner as a dinner reservation. The suite we chose was fun two floors with interesting decor. However little things such as shower head (water leaking all over the floor that we had to mop up w towels) or the super high bathroom counter strange sinks ... it's like the decor is fun but to look at but not entirely functional. Again I had just spent 4 nights in an almost perfect place so am comparing. Another example I had brought some champagne from Spain and had asked if they would mind chilling it for me and then they charged me a corkage fee ... totally understandable but we just simply wanted to enjoy this special bottle in the privacy of our room....The last place I was at would have been thrilled to chill a special bottle of wine for us. When I approached the owner about this at payment time she made me feel like I was some kind of free-loading leech and unfortunately she made me feel a bit uncomfortable at this point ... as far as hospitality goes it would have been SO simple for her to just waive the fee as a gesture and I might be leaving a different review right now. Overall this Riad was lovely but felt like much more of a business than a home away from home like we were only customers and they looked for all opportunities to charge for every service. Airport transfers not included like other places either - for example there were three of us so we were charged three times the amount to all go to the same place. The warmth just wasn't as authentic as I had already experienced at Dar Assiya...  Several pluses however the location is really excellent so I think maybe they have to be so money-focused because they have more overhead because of their onsite restaurant and prime location. Keep in mind you will have outside people coming into the Riad to have dinner which feels a bit invasive. Kitchen staff and the manager Aziz were always very helpful. Nice breakfast included. Wi-fi not great here. I was also having some email trouble and they let me use the computer in their office which was very nice of them. They welcome you with tea and offer you a nice little organic soap. This place was very pretty and while I probably wouldn't stay here again don't let this this review discourage you from choosing it ... if I hadn't had such a wonderful stay at Dar Assiya to compare this place to I would have been much more impressed by everything.,Date of stay: November 2016,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Vancouver, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/laurabR3556YZ
72 Riad Living,Monifa P wrote a review Dec 2016,50,Perfection! Amazing wedding week in Marrakech,Our stay at Riad 72 was amazing. Stefania and her team are a true team and work effortlessly towards making the guest experience amazing. We stayed at Riad 72 as part of our wedding week. To curate the perfect experience for our wedding guests I recommended my guests to spend part of their week in the Médina. Riad 72 and Riad Due did a great job accommodating our guest's requests and making them feel welcome as well as helping them coordinate their outings around town. My guests shared with me that their trip to our wedding was an amazing experience. I believe the teams at Riad 72 and Riad Due were a major contributor to this.    The rooms are beautifully designed and decorated. It's the perfect combination of local architecture and modern design. And in my opinion neither is sacrificed. They blend together perfectly! The breakfast is amazing. And it is the perfect way for guests to start their day. The lunches and dinners are devine....seriously....the have rabbit tagine. I can't wait to go back for it 😀.    My husband and I have already decided that we will go back for our 1 year anniversary and I just hope that I can wait that long!    Thank you for my making my wedding week magical.

72 Riad Living,MarkIrl wrote a review Nov 2016,50,Birthday Party - entire Riad,For a special birthday celebration I booked out Riad 72 for three nights. Myself along with 14 close friends had an amazing and memorable trip to Marrakesh made all the more special by our time in Riad 72. With seven rooms we were able to have exclusive use of the Riad making the most of the roof terrace and courtyard. Many of us also used the spa and Hamman. This event had been in planning for a number of months with Stefania and her team being more than just helpful in planning. We had champagne and cocktail on the roof terrace just before sun set followed by a traditional meal in the courtyard. Following a cake accompanied by a very special happy birthday song from the staff we danced the night away in the salon. I can't give enough praise and thanks to Rachid Asma Aziz and Stefania for a care and attention they gave us all during our stay.    For anyone looking to do the same in Marrakesh I highly recommend Riad 72. The design of the riad and bedrooms is traditional yet modern space with all the comforts you’d expect of a five star hotel.

72 Riad Living,rugbymug wrote a review Oct 2016,40,Lovely Riad,This is a lovely little riad within the medina of Marrakech. There are a number of rooms with varying styles so make sure you look at their website and choose the room you want when booking. Ours was maybe not one of the nicest (being cheaper) and had we been willing to pay more the rest of the riad was virtually empty and other rooms were free. The biggest issue with our room was the lack of door on the bathroom which meant that you have to be very comfortable with your travelling partner...  Service was excellent and the food and drink served was first-rate. As mentioned it is an oasis of calm in a very hectic busy city.,Date of stay: January 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Melbourne, Australia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rugbymug
72 Riad Living,Samantha S wrote a review Oct 2016,50,"Simply Perfection, our high expectations were exceeded!!!!! Outstanding.",We booked this riad after reviewing the trip advisor reviews. This was a romantic wedding proposal weekend away without the kids for the first time so a lot was riding on this so our expectations were high and were truly exceeded. Everything about this riad and the customer service and welcome you receive is so amazing I don't know where to start! Our welcome was fantastic with everything well organised from our airport pick up arrival and so much else. Stefiana and her team are true professionals and our every whim was catered for with a smile. Special thanks to Rashid Asthma Aziz the security guard who escorted us to some restaurant reservations always on time when you phoned him and very friendly the whole team are outstanding. If you don't like impersonal large chain hotels and want the boutique luxury with a personal feel this is for you. I know my now Fiance contacted Stefiana prior to arrange a few things for our big night which all went seamlessley we had a private meal on the rooftop terrace all to ourselves which was excellent and also had a hammam and massage which were to die for. The food is excellent I tried the riad burger also which is recommended the breakfast is awesome (we don't have a particularly sweet tooth and being true brits we fancied fried eggs one morning which were catered for with no hesitation with additional sides of french toast). Our room was delightful with everything we could possible need bed comfortable and I loved the luxury spa toiletries which I had to take all home with me. We had a deluxe room with a private terrace offering amazing views of the city. The whole riad smells amazing is quiet and calming and is a true oasis in the heady hustle and bustle of the medina. I could go on more but would like to say I have travelled extensively and this is the best hotel I have ever had the pleasure of staying in I cannot recommend this riad enough to anyone thinking of staying.

72 Riad Living,RusticM wrote a review Oct 2016,50,A fantastic central place to base your visit to Marrakech,Marrakech is an incredibly vibrant and bustling city with something to see around every corner and at any angle. When you've reached the end of a long day exploring you're going to want a place like Riad 72 to escape to relax and recharge. It's a restored classic Riad—a building with a beautiful open-air courtyard surrounded by a few rooms which open up to balconies. The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful. The manager Stefania lent us a cell phone to use to contact her or their staff at any time and although we didn't take her up on it she also offered one of her staff to escort us to any of our dinner reservations or evening excursions. The hotel itself only has about 7 or so rooms so it's intimate. They offer their own spa services and have a restaurant in the lobby. They serve breakfast each morning which we chose to take up on the roof. And because this particular building is just a bit higher than those surrounding it has amazing views. It's located right inside the old medina or city center and is easily within walking distance of pretty much all of the major tourist locations. The design is modern and comfortable while feeling very authentic. We were told that in the near future they'll be restoring buildings on either side of the Riad with an expanded restaurant a few more rooms and a pool.

First the space: modern and classic. Definitely feels like a Marrakesh/Riad experience rendered with simplicity and classic elegance. It was an oasis of tranquility at the beginning and end (and sometimes middle) of each day. The rooftop as the perfect place to relax over breakfast or a glass of tea (or wine) at the end of each day. Our room was... magnificent. We stayed in a suite and it was... magnificent. I don't know how else to describe it. Big and beautiful with every comfort.    Next the location: Right in the medina. We walked nearly everywhere but it's also easy access to taxi dropoff and pickup.    Finally the people. Stefania and her team at Riad 72 were perfection. Kind helpful attentive friendly.

Simply wow.,During our stay we travelled in a big group which enabled us to rent the entire Riad 72 but I'm sure regardless of the size of your group you'll have the same kind of experience we had. Personally I was blown away by firstly the interiors and themes that varied from room to room. You could really see that someone had gone that extra mile to find that pillow or that chandelier to add the cherry on the cake. Secondly the service inside as well as outside of the Riad was first class. Stefania and team always made us feel safe and looked after 24/7. For myself who had never been to Marrakesh before I found I felt completely relaxed for this very reason. They organised cabs to take us wherever we needed to go as well as picking us up and we were all given emergency phones in case we ever needed assistance. Stefania also arranged restaurant bookings suggested shopping destinations and other activities throughout our stay which was super helpful. Some of us also visited other Riads only to come back home feeling very content about our choice of living.

Stefania and her team were wonderfully attentive yet never overbearing and left us to socialise together as friends.  They knew exactly who we were (we rented the whole Riad) and which rooms we were staying in so our bills were already sorted when we came to check out which was extraordinary.    The Riad itself was beautiful well maintained clean and the rooms are spectacular. A variety of sizes and styles which compliment the traditional yet modern style of the building.    The only flaw (and this is purely down to personal preference) would be the lack of eggs in the morning 😊 a traditional breakfast was served and it was lovely but eggs or a choice in the morning would have taken our spoiling to the next level.....    Housekeeping was flawless the bathrooms were modern and have great showers. The in house spa (I had a Hammam) was AMAZING.

I loved getting back from the chaos of the souks and being welcomed by the candle light and relaxing music in the patio.    Stefania and her staff are providing an outstanding service and you really feel you’re catered for. Stefania was very kind and helpful explaining how to get to all the places we wanted to see and provided us with a local mobile phone to use it anytime we needed help. The small details in the service like a welcome fruit basket fresh roses in the room sweets left on the nightstand and bottles of water provided daily are making a huge difference. Not to mention the cleanliness of the room which was done twice a day.    The food was delicious; fresh tasty and beautifully served. We recommend couples to ask for a romantic dinner on the rooftop terrace.    We also had a pleasant massage.

72 Riad Living,jaaaaaaase wrote a review Jul 2016,50,"Riad 72 is unique, if not in it's interior beauty of design, then most certainly in it's team and flawless service.",My partner and I stayed for 4 nights and a day.  We were welcomed by Aviv stepping out of our Riad 72 private taxi who escorted us to the hotel from Dar-el-Bacha (a useful taxi waypoint).    Stepping through the black cedar entrance door you are greeted not only by pleasant staff but a serene ambient courtyard shaded by the swaying green leaves of a banana tree. Under which you are asked to sit at a table where staff present you with Moroccan Mint tea & Pastries served in wonderfully ornate silverware. The tea glass being topped up you receive the keys to your room and shown the Riad's layout.    Before arrival we had already booked dinner a 'La Table du Rhiad'. All food from the Kitchen is freshly prepared made to order and served exquisitely. The roof of the Riad is perfect for an aperitif a romantic meal for two or to dine with friends.    The rooms- no words can describe them their roofs nor individual character.    The first morning we choose a table where staff promptly arrange it for breakfast.

Shortly after breakfast we are greeted by Stefania (the Owner) who spares no expense of her time or sincerity in making you feel at home and your needs catered for.  With her professional insight we were able to plan an itinerary at short notice that very same morning and arrange trips to the Atlas mountains for later in our trip.    Guests are provided a phone with useful telephone numbers the Riad 72 team Stefania security taxi escorts. An reassuring sense of security and safety.    The Riad 72 is situated PERFECTLY in the Heart of the Medina so Stefania talked us through incredibly designed and easy to read pocket maps and from there you are ready to embrace the bustling Souks to the contemporary spacious Jardin Majorelle.    After a long last day and to finish our stay we treated ourselves to Hammam body scrub steam and massage. Followed by a bask in the sun upon the roof. Which was utter bliss.    Due to a rearrangement in our flights we were allowed a late check-out at the discretion of the hotel (for obvious reasons).  This only added to the unequivocal feeling of luxury and professionalism by Stefania and the Riad 72 team.    Riad 72 is unique if not in it's interior beauty of design then most certainly in it's team and flawless service.

72 Riad Living,Kristine wrote a review Jul 2016,50,Seamless service and a true paradise,This Riad is the most incredible hotel I have ever stayed at. From the warm reception we received when we arrived right down to the tiny day to day details.    Breakfast was amazing every morning as was the many lunches and dinners we had here (the best food we ate in marrakesh for sure) . Everything is very fresh and locally sourced you can taste the difference. Lots of variety for breakfast.    Stephania was amazing from the first email booking our stay to the last moments before we left. She accommodated our group of four very well and all the staff felt like family by the time we left.    We truly thought of the riad as our marrakesh home. The security guard walked us anywhere we wanted after dark and came to meet us and walk us home after. The porter woke up at 4am to walk me to my taxi which was all arranged.    The rooms were incredible the suite we stayed in was a amazing huge room with a fantastic skylight and charming touches. To top it all off the riad has its own hamman and massage room with excellent services.    I would return to marrakesh just to experience staying here again.

72 Riad Living,Eric K wrote a review Jul 2016,50,Excellent Riad with flawless service,Travelling by arranged taxi the staff was waiting for us by drop off point and led us through to the riad. We were very impressed upon arrival. The design is so ambient inside the riad; giving such a big contrast from the busy street. We were welcomed with mint tea and biscuit.    We booked the room with a terrace and it is over my expectation. Room is clean air conditioned and well decorated. The bathroom is spacious with walk in shower. Terrace has table sun beds cooling shower etc. All were what we need. Room is cleaned and fresh towel change twice. The soap and shampoo are nicely selected. The only thing is slight dim in the room but we find it ok as giving us more chilling from the hot weather. Wifi signal is good in the room but slight weak in the private terrace.    For the on site restaurant we find that it is one of the best meal in Marrakech. We recommend to try the made to order dishes. The cous cous dish gave us a total new image of what it really should be. It was fragrant and moist. The Tangia meat is tendered and well spiced.    Breakfast changed daily on the main dish.    People talk about hammam in a traditional spa but we would say the on site hammam and message have to try. It is relaxing less hassle with mint tea served after.    Once again thank you to all the staffs and manager Stefani. Service is excellent friendly and attentive. Also praise to the driver (for the excursion) you partner with. He is patient and friendly.,Date of stay: July 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Kyoto, Japan",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/erickE877WB
72 Riad Living,Celiathurs wrote a review Jul 2016,50,A hidden gem,Hidden behind a very non-assuming door this riad is a secret gem. The courtyard is filled with lush greenery with tables scattered around for breakfast lunch or dinner. The team lead by Stefania were so smiley polite and welcoming nothing was too much trouble. Our room was stunning with beautiful grey tadelakt surfaces and our own private roof terrace – a real luxury in Marrakech. Evenings were spent having a gin and tonic on the terrace and admiring the view. We did not eat at the restaurant but it looked amazing be sure to book.,Date of stay: June 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Celiathurs
72 Riad Living,John T wrote a review Jul 2016,50,A haven of tranquility as soon as you walk through the very unassuming front door,I'd seen the reviews of this place and I have to say it was amazing. First trip to Marrakech so we didn't really know what to expect but as soon as you walk into the courtyard this place is very special.    Stefanie from the Riad had got in touch the day before and organised our transfer. Porter to meet us at the taxi drop off and collect our bags and everything was set up perfectly. We booked a deluxe room so that we had a terrace looking onto the courtyard and I would advise checking if you want this. I think it makes a difference to be able to sit out but most of the rooms have this. Fantastic bathroom split level room with a separate sitting area the whole thing felt very authentic.    The staff were all terrific. Highlight of the stay was sitting on the roof terrace eating breakfast looking out over the roof tops to the mountains and listening to the morning prayer call.    This Riad is great since it's not right in mad centre of the Medina and the Soukhs. It only takes about 3 minutes to walk there but you also feel like you are escaping the frantic pace of the Medina a little when you get there.    I can't fault this place. Crisps with the sea bass was the only oddity but the food was great overall and it looks very stylish. And I can't speak highly enough of the Staff. Seen Richard C's post on style over substance but I could not disagree more. This is a cool place to be where we were really well looked after. We also left a couple of items behind and Stefanie sorted it straight out.,Date of stay: July 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R2146MGjohnt

Stefania and her staff were outstanding. The room we had was big comfortable and had multiple air conditioners...a must in the heat of June/July. The staff helped with guides taxis maps recommendations restaurants...most of the time we did not even need to ask they seemed to be one step ahead of us in anticipating what we wanted. After the first day they knew what we wanted to drink when to prepare for breakfast everything.

72 Riad Living,Richard C wrote a review Jul 2016,30,Disappointing,This self proclaimed boutique hotel is rather a let down - there is no denying that everything looks lovely but it's a case of style over substance. Maybe as much effort should have been made getting the showers and air conditioning to work.  We booked three rooms - two standard and a deluxe - the deluxe had a kami kaze staircase up to a sleeping platform that would have given anyone who works in Health and Safety nightmares. We declined the deluxe room and had to take a suite (at extra cost) - 'suite' meant it had a sitting area but you couldn't swing a cat in it!  We ate one night at the much hyped restaurant but again the views were fantastic but for some of us the food was the worst we had in Morocco. The Beldi chicken in the tagine described as having more tasty meat is in fact anorexic and little more than bones. The Tanjia had been so over cooked it was drier than the Sahara and had long lost any taste.  The are lots of Riads to choose from that give a much better and more authentic experience at a faction of the price.,Date of stay: June 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Penryn, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/richardcN1899II

As soon as we checked in they served us an amazing breakfast spread that would put the Four Seasons to shame. Then after giving us time to settle they handed us a mobile with the hotel # the manager's # and security all preprogrammed to ensure we always felt safe. Lastly as 3 girls we worried about walking around after dark but Riad 72 took care of this by providing us with an escort to and from our dinners. Literally the best service I've experienced in a long time at this adorable boutique hotel with a tremendous rooftop view. Be sure to check it out - you won't regret it.

72 Riad Living,okane256 wrote a review Jun 2016,50,"Five Star Staff in a Very Peaceful, Secure and Relaxed House Hotel.",Riad72 was a bit of a change in our usual holiday experience as we usually stay at the upper end of the hotel market as the service industry is part of our work and we use these opportunities to see how other people/cultures/countries are providing services to guests/clients.    I'm not always comfortable in the intimacy of a House Hotel but Riad72 had some of the best staff I've come across in some of the world's leading hotels. I can say with great conviction that Stafania the hotel Manager's attention to detail and organisation skills are among the best I've encountered - and she was on holidys when we were there - her replacement Medhi was outstanding. Warm friendly and full of laughs really went beyond our expectations. Aziz and Moustaffa (apologies if this is spelt incorrectly) provided excellent service also excellent table waiting from Moustaffa - he is an asset to the hotel and Aziz was permanently busy with making sure everything was running smoothly.    I strongly recommend the restaurant it was quiet when we were staying which was what we wanted - note that some dishes need to be pre-ordered as they're true handmade traditional dishes. Delicious Moroccan wine on the menu. The breakfast was outstanding delicious fruit cocktail and an array of pastries all very yummy. Soft cheese butter and mouthwatering trio of preserves always including delicious Moroccan honey.    The roof was my favourite part especially in the evening - it was often very quiet (apart from the Friday when patrons from outside the hotel visited the bar its seen as a bit of a hotspot I think) you can use the phone to order drinks on the roof. this was my only criticism and it really is a miniscule attention to detail that I'd recommend having perhaps a camera to show the waiting staff that someone is on the roof and perhaps would like a drink as using the phone was a little hit and miss in terms of being understood in our order.    Other than that and it really wasn't an issue just a bit of a reccomendation our stay was excellent.

We arrived feeling exhausted after an 11 hr minibus trip so stepping through the doors of Riad 72 very nearly made me cry! The welcome from Stefania was wonderful having our hands washed in rose water & then being served Morrocan pastries and mint tea whilst our paperwork was completed was lovely. We were lucky enough to receive a room upgrade which gave us a stunning room with a private roof terrace on which we had breakfast both mornings of our stay (17 & 18 March 2016).    The interior of Riad 72 is very chic and relaxing. The staff are eager to help you & very polite. Stefania ensured we knew how to find our way to and from the Riad & also provided us with a mobile phone in case we got lost or needed help! (Thankfully we didn't need it!)    Our meal on our first night was delicious & had my partner not been feeling so ill (tonsillitis!) I'm sure we would have eaten in the Riad again.

I would have liked to stay at the suite for our full stay but unfortunately the room wasn't available for the full duration but it wasn't a bad thing in the end since Aman was a brilliant experience in its own right.    We had the most amazing time in Marrakech and I can't thank the staff at Riad 72 enough for their amazing hospitality and great recommendations ranging from places to visit in Marrakech to the foodstalls to go at Djame el fena which could be quite a daunting task for tourists.    We also tried their restaurant which was a great experience with freshly sourced ingredients and food cooked to order. Don't miss out their special Lamb or beef Tangia but be aware that you need to place the order 6 hours in advance but then patience pays with exquisite dining experience.    Finally my wife used their spa for massage couple of times and was very happy with the masseuse who specialized in pregnancy massages and was called by the management especially for her. Another example of details they took care of to make our stay wonderful.

We also had massages and a hammam one evening which were fantastic and so relaxing.    Getting to the Riad itself through the narrow winding streets can feel a bit intimidating in the evening. The Riad gives you a mobile and there's a security guard who can accompany you in the evening if you need it - we took advantage of this a couple of times when we came back late after dinner out it's a great touch.

We had never stayed in a riad before but i would highly recommend it as an authentic way to experience Morocco. The building is beautiful and transports you to another world. The service was brilliant; especially the lovely lady that served our breakfast every morning. Our room like the whole riad was spotless and we loved the breakfast. I wish i could have the recipe for the Moroccan pancakes and umm symon (that spelling isn't accurate!)  The location was perfect as the riad is tucked away down a quiet alley but only a few minutes walk to the souks and main streets. The access to a local mobile with details of important contacts such as the riad's main number and Stefania's mobile number was a great idea. The only things that would have improved our experience were to include the return airport transfer in the booking as the journey there is included. The one other thing is to perhaps have a small fridge in the room as all of the water is room temperature and on a hot day you really need a cold drink!  On our last day we booked a hammam followed by mint tea which was so relaxing - we would recommend this to anyone!

Every single staff member greats you with a smile and hello and asks how your day was. After feeling like a number at El Fenn this was very appreciated. The decor is stunning. Modern/Minimalist Moroccan. Monochromatic with pops of color.    If you can stay in the Karma Suite. It is worth the splurge. The room is enormous with a wooden ceiling with a carved out skylight. You feel like you're in a palace.    The breakfast was fantastic. The rooms are quiet beds are beyond comfortable. The location is perfect in quieter back alley and only a 7-8 minute walk from the busier souks. It's a nice escape from the insanity.    The only thing that could be improved is the bathroom in the Karma Suite - the mirror above the sink is really hard to look into if you're tall. Therefore making it almost impossible for a man to shave during his stay.

From the minute we arrived at the Riad the welcoming service from Stefania and the rest of the team was above and beyond. Stefania made us feel so at home. When we arrived she sat down with us (after being served refreshing towels mint tea and pastries of course) and provided maps recommendations and info on the Riad's facilities. They even provide you with your own mobile phone for your stay. This is pre-loaded with the manager's number if you need anything and also the hotel security guard's number if you ever needed assistance not that we ever did but it was a nice touch to know we were so looked after. We enjoyed dinner and drinks on the roof terrace - food was excellent. Breakfast was included and was lovely a selection of pastries fruit juices and coffee. You can enjoy this in the courtyard area or on the roof terrace. Hammam and massages were also a fantastic experience we were glad we chose to do this at the Riad rather than an outside spa as we could sit in the relaxing room in the courtyard area and sip on more mint tea after our treatments and then slope upstairs to our room in our robes. Room was extremely comfortable with plenty storage space and free wifi. Could not recommend this place enough! It was such a lovely calm oasis away from the hustle and bustle of the outside streets.

72 Riad Living,Meg L wrote a review Apr 2016,50,Luxurious calm in a great location!,I researched lots of riads before choosing Riad 72 and we definitely made a great choice! I wanted something with a rooftop terrace and the overall reviews for Riad 72 made me think that it would also give us a central location excellent service calm and tranquility and a bit of chic sophistication. It gave us all of those and more! It was our first visit to Marrakech and getting the transfer from the airport to the riad made it so easy to find our way and get settled in. We were met by Asiz and he took us through the little streets to the riad entrance where we enjoyed the mint tea and pastries in the lovely courtyard. Stefania and the whole team treated us so specially throughout our visit as I'm sure they do to all their guests. Our room was one with a private roof terrace which was lovely to have an afternoon nap on and listen to the sounds of the birds and the call to prayer. Breakfast was great with pastries fresh orange juice eggs homemade crepes fresh yogurt and we also had dinner one evening on the main roof terrace - Mustafa tended to our every want and it was a lovely way to enjoy delicious Moroccan cuisine in a tranquil setting but knowing that the heart of the medina was just a few minutes walk away. Stefania arranged a camel ride for us which was great and we also took advantage of the hamman in the riad which was truly wonderful.  Overall a great stay at Riad 72 and we hope to come back to relax and enjoy Marrakech again!

But instead there was Asiz waiting for us and ready to bring us to a breath-taking hotel.  When we entered our eyes were amazed to see the remarkable entrance and were filled with the sparkling light which came from the very particular water fountain. The guests arrive and are welcomed by Stefania a beautiful and joyful woman which brings even more color to your stay at Riad 72.  She accompanied us to our room called Amal. It was only when Stefania opened the door that we understood what an astonishing work did the owner do.  The days passed and our stay got better every day. We went to the Medina which is pretty easy to arrive to since the hotel is practically in it.  Stefania was also so kind to tell us restaurants and shops of the place.  When the last day approached we were so demoralized that we decided to stay 2 days more. Thanks to Stefania we were able to stay in the same room.

The venue is amazing lovingly and tastefully decorated with a perfect mix between Moroccan and Italian refinements.

The hotel was perfect for a special birthday treat for my wife.    The location is excellent in the Medina but in a quiet well kept derb with plenty of local families. The facilities were great and the interior design was just right a perfect blend of traditional Arabic and simple elegance.    The staff were wonderful throughout and were attentive and helpful without ever being pushy the breakfasts were delicious with fresh strawberries and raspberries and freshly squeezed orange juice a welcome accompaniment to traditional Moroccan pastries and pancakes.    Marrakech is a fascinating city which I found surprisingly progressive and full of contemporary art and design blending traditional artisans skills such wood and leather work with modern design and ideas.

I spent a lot time researching the riad's within the medina and we were not disappointed.  When you arrive by taxi you will have a two minute walk to riad 72 through traditional alleys. Don't be concerned no hassle whatsoever you are escorted by porter you need him to find the riad.  Once behind the front door your are welcomed in traditional Moroccan style and the look and feel was everything I was looking for. Our room was superb very comfortable breakfast served in the courtyard was excellent and the roof terrace very relaxing after a couple of hours walking the medinas.

They can also arrange guided private tours for you - we went to the Atlas Mountains - The valley of Ourika one day: It included: Private driver a 2 hours guided track in the hills... afterwards great lunch overlooking the beautiful landscape and a visit to a bio-garden on the way home.

We had a bit of a problem with our shower as it had a handheld sprayer and an overhead rainwater shower head but the overhead one would not stay on consistently. The location was quite nice close to the main action in the medina but down a quiet side street/alley. We probably should have scheduled a tour with a guide as we got lost almost every time we left the riad!

On the last day when checking out the card machine said to have 'failed' the transaction of our card twice. When contacting our bank to see what the problem was they told us that the first payment had been processed. Stefania the manager of Riad 72 was insistent that we were wrong despite our bank manager speaking to her on the phone.    She was rude patronizing and quite frankly obnoxious in the way she handled matters. Thank goodness for the man who was working with her in the office. He was kind and helpful. The matter is still to be resolved and our bank says the have committed a fraud here so DO watch out.    Also DO NOT listen to her dinner recommendations.

72 Riad Living,Redavs wrote a review Dec 2015,40,Magical Stay in Marrakech,Staying at Riad 72 was an absolute pleasure. It is ideally located in the Bab Doukala district which is within 10 minutes walking distance from all the main sights and very easy access to the new city.  There was street parking available at a nearby mosque which was fairly reasonable in price.    Reaching the Riad has that charming experience where you walk through some dimly lit and unassuming alley ways until you come across a sign that says 72 and a simple wooden door in a wall. And then you step inside and it takes you by surprise!  I enjoyed the interiors of the Riad. It kept true to the local theme while not overdoing it on the zelij and arabesques as in some other Riads. It's was all very quiet and tasteful. The courtyard is a calm place to sit and drink some sweet mint tea and read a book while the water feature a sculpture of sorts gives you some calm background noise.    The dining room is notably different in a dark red tone with some unique paintings and European furniture. It's a good setting for a romantic dinner and the food was very good.    What really sets this Riad apart though is the service. It's the quality of service that many 5 star hotels aspire to where the staff are well integrated an capable of providing the guest with whatever service they need whether it's their responsibility or their colleagues. The answer is always positive and accompanied with a warm smile.    Stefania the hotel manager also does an excellent job of checking on guests regularly to ensure their stay is going well. She is also very knowledgable about the town and made some excellent recommendations for our sightseeing.    For lovers of breakfasts... This Riad had some of the best I've ever experienced in a hotel setting. All of the Moroccan pastries were freshly prepared that morning for you to enjoy and some even made to order. Alongside were some beyond excellent local jams or deferent flavours and rich honey. The local labneh cheese served in a sort of wax paper I could not get enough of. I also strongly recommend ordering some eggs cooked to perfection. Fried eggs with a topping of 'khlie' a kind of Moroccan salty dried beef cannot be beaten. The tea and coffee was good as usual.  There is the option to have breakfast on the terrace should weather allow. The view over the medina and the Djama El Fna mosque is stunning especially in a clear day when you see the snow capped Atlas Mountains in the background.  Be prepared to contend with some honey bees though who will slowly swarm around your breakfast in an effort to steal some honey. This might bother some people as it forced us to move down stairs. A large party nearby was comfortable so again it depends on individual squeamishness.    Each room is unique in its space and design. Ours was split over 2 levels a ground floor living room where you entered the suite and a mezzanine of sorts where the bedroom and bathroom were located. In the bathroom there was a very little door to sneak out onto the terrace.    The beds were very comfortable and the room was beautifully designed quiet and calm. The perfect retreat after a day of souk shopping haggling and sightseeing.    The spa facilities might have been a bit overstated. The hammam room is a traditional one with tadelakt walls with heat coming through them. However it's quite small and didn't really suite 2 people at once. The woman who carried out the treatment managed well however leaving us satisfyingly clean at the end of it.    The massage that followed was a bit disappointing. It didn't seem bedded in any technique and at times the masseuses made a poor effort to maintain personal privacy. The disposable underwater was also frustratingly small flimsy and see through. For those not used to getting massages regularly it can be quite discomforting. I wouldn't probably try the spa somewhere else next time.    The hotel feels very secure. The staff are very trustworthy and there is a guard al hours of the day. We were also kindly given a utility phone to contact the hotel should we need any guidance tips or in case of an emergency. I thought this was a nice touch.    I would certainly stay there again on my next trip to Marrakech mostly for the great service and the cool style of the Riad.,Date of stay: November 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Stockholm, Sweden",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Redavs
72 Riad Living,AKATZ419 wrote a review Dec 2015,50,Riad 72 - A Hidden Gem,As someone in the travel industry I've spent time in world class hotels and can honestly say that my time at Riad72 did not pale in comparison. Stefanie Mehdi and the rest of the team made the riad feel like a home away from home in a foreign land. I felt comfortable and well taken care of from the moment I stepped through the doors. They also provide a local phone pre-programmed with staff numbers which further reinforced my feeling of safety and security while traveling on my own. Riad72 is a truly special setting with impeccable decor delectable food and incredible views - a place of serenity in a fast-paced city. It also couldn't be more conveniently located in the heart of the the medina just a stone's throw from authentic Moroccan shops and minutes from the famous Djemma El Fnaa Square. If you have the opportunity to enjoy breakfast on the rooftop take it as there are few better ways to start a morning in Marrakech.

Great place to relax and disconnect met 2 lovely travellers from Japan. The staff are super friendly organized airport transfer when I first arrived and when I left extremely prompt in their emails. If you don't get a chance to stay you must visit for the food - their chef Fatouma is brilliant I still can taste her wonderful spiced carrot soup and tagine I asked if I could get a class and the hotel graciously arranged for me to join Fatooma whilst she cooked up her magic a lovely Berber lady with whom I managed to converse in Arabic and broken French! They have a small library room mainly old French/English books that appear to have been left behind by previous travellers but nonetheless a nice welcome refuge. There's a wonderful dining room downstairs which lovely art I was told they've hosted many weddings and I can definitely see it as a great location for a small family/friends holiday gathering.

The environment was beautiful. Rooms spacious and attractive with lovely finishing touches such as dressing gowns fruit basket water and plentiful toiletries.    The hotel provided a mobile phone for our use should we need it which we did not. We were also offered the security guard to escort to and from the taxi rank should we feel insecure or have difficulty navigating the streets. Whilst we didn't require this service it is a thoughtful extra.    Breakfast in the courtyard was both relaxing and yummy.

72 Riad Living,Margaux V wrote a review Dec 2015,50,Security Escorts for Your Evening Activities,Riad 72 was spectacular! Everyone has already said how it is a little oasis in the craziness of the Medina but one of the best things that the hotel has not received enough credit for is the services it offers to look after its guests. The hotel gives each guest a cell phone to call the hotel for assistance if ever needed and provides a security guard to walk you to and from destinations in the evening. We were 3 women traveling by ourselves so the security escort enabled us to continue our adventures into the evening and explore some of the amazing dinner spots the city has to offer. The staff is also always willing to help with a smiling face and breakfast became a highlight of our day with delicious little yogurts served in pretty little jars and cheeses wrapped with bows.

72 Riad Living,Nabil A wrote a review Dec 2015,50,An absolutely wonderful experience,Everything from the checkin to the checkout was perfect. The manager upgraded us to the suite and took care of the check in procedure while they served us with tea. All the staff and manager were very courteous and took care of all our needs. They even provided us with a local mobile in case we needed help when we were out and about.    The breakfast which was complimentary varied for the two days we stayed there and consisted of fresh homemade stuff. But the best thing was their dinner menu. We tried 3 different tagines and absolutely loved each one of them. The one with lamb pomegranate and roasted almonds was my personal favourite.    The Riad had a hammam and massage place as well which we didnt avail though in hindsight maybe we should have.    The Riad had a rooftop terrace as well on which you could enjoy beautiful views of the mountains while sipping a cup of Moroccan tea.    Cant recommend it enough.

72 Riad Living,Rachael H wrote a review Nov 2015,50,Beautiful Riad for 30th Birthday Trip,We stayed at Riad 72 for 4 nights this November to celebrate my 30th birthday and can’t recommend it enough.  The Raid itself is beautiful calm and clean as well perfectly located within the Medina. I stayed in stunning Karma Suite which was stunning huge and perfect for a special occasion. It came equipped with a Nespresso machine hair dryer Bluetooth speaker and everything you could need. Our group of four also booked the Amal Delux Room with twin bed which was a smaller room but came with its own terrace overlooking the courtyard. On arrival we were offered a rose water hand wash which was a lovely way to refresh from the flight and a choice of soaps which were then placed in our room. The bottles of water and fresh fruit that were also provided in our room everyday were also a nice touch.  The main square souks were all only 10 minutes’ walk away but the moment you stepped into the Riad you felt far removed from the hustle and bustle - the central courtyard with banana trees and water feature was a great place to relax. With only 7 rooms you nearly always felt you had the place to yourselves. We loved wandering past the local shops just around the corner from the Riad a few times a day– it made you feel part of the community and the woodwork shop was amazing!  The Riad had thought of everything and all the little touches such as the personalised map transfer from the airport a cell phone to use during your stay and a security guard who could come meet you from a taxi if you wanted (not at all necessary but a nice touch) really made us feel relaxed and welcome. The complimentary mint tea and nibbles were delicious and very welcome after busy days exploring the city.  Stefania and all her team were all very friendly discrete and efficient and even made me a birthday cake and sang to me on the morning of my birthday which was very sweet. Nothing was too much trouble and they were happy to host us for breakfast and dinner on the wonderful roof terrace (which has great views from its high vantage point) with hardly any notice. We had to meals at the Riad in addition to the great and varied spreads at breakfast and would highly recommend eating in the restaurant at least once.  It was my first trip to Marrakesh and I would not hesitate to stay at Riad 72 when I return!,Date of stay: November 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/879rachaelh

72 Riad Living,andrew f wrote a review Nov 2015,50,Brilliant!!!,We stayed at Riad 72 for 3 nights in November which was a brilliant choice as we had a great time. Even before we arrived I had conversed with Stefania who was very helpful and always got back to me promptly. When we arrived we were greeted by her with biscuits and mint tea which is very tasty she went through everything we needed to know about our stay including places to visit and gave us a mobile phone in case we did get lost and couldn't fin dour way out of the Medina which will happen but fortunately we found our way back. The Riad is positioned in a perfect place not in the heart of the souks but 5 minute walk to them which gives you that nice feelign of relation when you're back. We organised a trip through the Riad to the Atlas Mountains which was great and a must in my opinion. We also used the Hammam and Massage facilities at the Riad which were also great. We ate at the restaurant a couple of times and the food was delicious and very reasonable for what you get plus the breakfasts were always plentiful and tasty. The roof top is also a lovely place to chill out with shade if you needor loungers to chill out with a dip pool. I would thoroughly recommend this Riad for a stay in Marrakech.

The location was great just outside the main throng of the souks but still close enough that it's easy to wander in and out. The central courtyard of the Riad has a lovely calm atmosphere and we enjoyed the offerings of the kitchen - both food and drink! Try the grey wine.  Don't expect to have a great view from your room - ours opened out onto the courtyard as I think many do so we had people walking past our windows but could still get privacy with shutters and curtains.

72 Riad Living,Chris wrote a review Nov 2015,50,If you don't enjoy superlatives then look away now....,"We spent three nights at Riad 72 at the beginning of October. It was one of the most pleasant and enjoyable stays that we have had anywhere ever. Riad 72 is a friendly oasis of tranquility that is perfectly located for exploring all that the Marrakech medina has to offer. The level of service is outstanding with Stefania and every member of her staff contributing to a fantastically friendly and relaxed atmosphere and providing a feeling of luxury that is at odds with the superb value (we paid less than £100 per night to stay in the beautifully decorated Lile room).  Each of the (currently 7) rooms is unique and beautifully decorated and the communal spaces from the courtyard (dominated by a giant palm) to the roof terrace (with fantastic views over the medina) all provide lovely spaces to relax over a glass of wine or mint tea. The fact that breakfast can be taken anywhere in the Riad is a lovely touch made only better by 'breakfast from 8am until whenever...""    Shortly after we booked Stefania contacted us to arrange transfer from the airport and as we would be arriving in late evening included a menu so that we could pre-book dinner on arrival. Our outbound flight was delayed by over two hours and despite arriving at approaching midnight our transfer was there to meet us at the airport and on arrival at Riad 72 there was a table laid in the stunning courtyard orange water brought to the table to wash our hands and a delicious meal provided with a very welcome bottle of wine...    If you have never been to Marrakech then Stefania provides a fantastic 'induction' to the city and all it has to offer and the Riad has produced a very useful custom map. For anyone feeling overwhelmed by the prospect of the assualt on the senses that Marrakech can be Riad 72 will arrange guides and even an on-call security service to walk you back to the Riad at night. Although I have to say we just dove straight into the city and found it to be one of the most entertaining non threatening and friendly places we have been whether by day or by night.    Marrakech is hot dusty and fascinating and after a day wandering the souks or a night in Jemma el Fnaa Square Riad 72 is the perfect place to relax and unwind.

72 Riad Living,Pandarocker wrote a review Nov 2015,50,Top Riad in Marrakech. Superb Hospitality,Of course there is a lot of Riads to choose from but if your are looking for the ultimate level of service and attention this is definitely your choice. Most of the Riads are beautiful designed and the Riad 72 is no exception. But what this one has to win all the honors is: service. Service in terms of hospitality. From the moment you get there everyone makes you feel like home. They follow a very high level of quality commitment. Example: Second morning at the Riad our daily host (they change turns daily) already knew that the day before I had coffee no tea before breakfast and from that moment on coffee was offered the EXACT way I asked for it the very first time. And then just apply this to everything! All these incredible people Mustafa Rashid Asma were amazingly close in every request we had. I personally thanks the Raid manager Stefania amazing job she is doing in the top Riad in Marrakech. She was always around with advice and making every possible option the pamper ourselves and enjoy Marrakech: dinner reservations top massages in the Riad the Hamam Bath experience expeditions out of the city... name it and she made it possible! Amazing.    If all of the above can't convince you here is the cherry: I think greatest and pleasant surprise you will recieve (or maybe you got the tip too) is the underestimated cooking at Riad 72. Super Chef and great guy Mustafa makes magic at the kitchen where their menu is constantly changing offering traditional moroccan cuisine with a twist. If you don't believe me try it for yourself. We got so amazed that we even took a cooking class and had a blast of fun!!! (a must for foodielovers btw). Thanks Stefania Asma & Mustafa again.

Stefania and her team looked after our every need in a very thoughtful yet subtle way. We contacted the hotel before we left the UK and asked them to arrange a taxi from the airport. This cost the equivalent of about £15 and the taxi took us to the nearest street to the hotel where we were met by a porter who helped us with our luggage. The Riad itself if stunningly beautiful. A square shaped building with a central courtyard with banana trees and a water feature. Our room was beautiful and we had our own private terrace which was a lovely place to rest after a hectic day out exploring (and getting lost). Providing guests with the use of a mobile phone is a nice touch although we didn't need it again it was nice to have. The food was exceptional and we enjoyed lunch on our terrace on the first day and also had two evening meals here down in the courtyard.

72 Riad Living,Icangothere wrote a review Oct 2015,50,Amazing!!!! Look No Further!,I will admit I did a lot I mean a lot of research on where to stay in Marrakech. Not quite sure how I found Riad 72 but I am sooooooo happy I did. This hotel did not disappoint. We were greeted at the taxi stand and our luggage was hand carted through the streets to the Riad. Upon entering Riad 72 I was blown away. The pictures do not do it justice. We were seated at a table in the courtyard and served tea and treats. We booked the Omnia Suite. Apparently when you book a suite you get to choose the soap you want. We were presented with a tray of soap in the log form. They asked us to smell each and we each got to choose which soap we wanted. They cut it and it was placed in in all soap dishes in our bathroom. When booking I had to choose between the Omnia or the Kharma Suite. I was told the Kharma Suite is very popular. But for some reason I was drawn to the Omnia Suite. It is a 2 story suite. Sitting room on the first floor. Bedroom huge closet and large bathroom upstairs. Not as bright and open as the Kharma Suite but much more warm and private. We had a lunch and a dinner on the roof. The food was good. The service was awesome. Nagir and Rachid are always there when you need something. We used the loungers and dipping pool. They do not have umbrellas for the loungers but the dipping pool is very refreshing. Stefania was always around to help with anything we needed. We were given a cell phone in casse we got lost in the medina. We used it twice. Once because we went to he Cafe Arabe instead of Maison Arabe and then when we really really got lost. Eshaham the security guard from the hotel came to our rescue both times. Nothing better then see him coming to rescue us. My husband and I can't say enough good things about our stay.

72 Riad Living,David H wrote a review Oct 2015,50,Fantastic Riad and wonderful people,A fantastic Riad in a great sector of the Medina. Everything from the very warm welcome we received from Stefania and her team the high quality aned interesting rooms and the overall feeling of calm and peace in your own homely oasis contributed to making this a special holiday. It's a happy house where nothing is too much trouble for Asma Rachid Rachid Mustapha and others who seem to delight in providing the best service delivered with warmth personality and humour. Stefania is a wealth of knowledge when it comes to finding good spots to shop eat and can arrange trips to just about everywhere. We would certainly recommend going to The Atlas Mountains for a day not too far and very beautiful.  Marrakech felt safe despite the crowds filling the narrow lanes in the Medina and walking is the best way of getting about. It's great to just wander about and explore and when it all gets too hot return to your temporary home to refresh relax and just enjoy the environment.  We would love to return to Marrakeck sometime (probably during spring) and would certainly stay at Riad 72 again.

Stepping through the door the attention to detail is immediately obvious. Every member of staff is kind warm and professional going out of their way to make your stay perfect. Stefania arranged trips to the Atlas Mountains and Palmeraie for us both of which exceeded expectation. We stayed in the Manar room which is beautifully decorated with the benefit of a roof terrace to enjoy the stunning sunsets. Food is extremely good you can choose to eat on the roof terrace and enjoy the view of night time Marrakech or in the centre of the Riad by candlelight. We also had a hamman while we were there would definitely recommend that too.

72 Riad Living,EmsieDesigns wrote a review Oct 2015,50,Beautiful Riad 72!,We stayed at Riad 72 for 5 nights and had the most amazing experience! This was our first time in Marrakech and definitely won't be the last. From the moment we arrived at the riad we were made to feel at home it was like living in a home and not a hotel. We were greeted by the lovely Stefania who is the manager there. She sat us down and gave us mint tea and Moroccan treats whilst explaining to us how everything works etc. Stefania was extremely thorough with everything and even explained where everything is locally on a map. A truly professional and very personal manager she is great at what she does! The staff at Riad 72 are all amazing and very hard working people. We were looked after mostly by Asma. She would be there as soon as you wake up to serve the most amazing breakfast and Asma always had the biggest smile on her face! Anything you wanted or needed Asma would do it! We didn't have to lift a finger!  We were a little bit nervous about venturing out to restaurants on our own at night so Stefania arranged for their security guard Icham to escort us and collect us from wherever we needed. Icham looked after us perfectly what a lovely guy! The riad also supplies you with a mobile phone so you can always reach them and feel safe when you go out alone.  The room was beautiful and spotlessly clean! The sheets smelt AMAZING! A few things that might be better in our room though would be the lighting in the bathroom (although I do understand that all riads are pretty dark) It was a little difficult to put make up on in that light! some shelves in the bathroom would of been good to put your cosmetics on but it didn't bother me that much that I wouldn't stay again! And also a full length mirror in the bedroom would of been helpful. The decor was absolutely beautiful though and very traditional.  All in all Riad 72 is a 5 star place with 5 star service 5 star food and 5 star smiles all round!! Would highly recommend to anyone going to Marrakech!!  Many thanks to Stefania Asma and Icham.

72 Riad Living,Michael700348 wrote a review Oct 2015,50,A Jewel in the Marrakesh Medina,From the moment you arrive at the Riad you feel welcomed and treated like royalty. The manager Stephania is there to greet you  answer your questions give you a map and information about the medina. Throughout your whole stay the staff is always friendly attentive and there to help you with anything you need or want. All the staff is terrific but we have to specially mention Sliman Asma Aziz and Rachid. The morning breakfast is a great start to the day. The dinners are also delicious and authentically Moroccan. We highly recommend the tagine dinners. It was wonderful coming home in the evening and sitting on the rooftop patio drinking a beer and listening to the call to prayers from the nearby mosques. The Riad has an authentic Moroccan ambiance and has a quiet atmosphere amid the chaos of the medina. We highly recommend Riad 72 for anyone visiting Marrakesh.

72 Riad Living,arinzeh3 wrote a review Sep 2015,50,Great Time at Riad 72,I stayed 4 nights at Riad 72 and had a great experience. It is ultra stylish boutique hotel but with only 7 rooms feels like your own house. The location is easy walking distance into the souks and many of the attractions within the medina.    What I loved most were the different places within the riad where you could spend time - the sunny courtyard to have breakfast the rooftop terrace to have dinner or watch the sun set the library to read a book inside or just the landing space outside your room to relax. I also had a massage which was wonderful.

72 Riad Living,Doodlemad wrote a review Sep 2015,50,Everything you could want and more,Well it was our first trip to Africa and not my choice but our daughters for her 21st. Found through Mr & Mrs Smith. Thankfully we chose Riad 72 and we certainly weren't disappointed. From initial email enquiries to our stay Stefania & her staff couldn't have done more to make our arrival stay & experiences any better. The rather inauspicious approach to the property seems quite normal as these Riads are often tucked away down narrow streets there was never any problems even when returning late at night. Asma looked after us so well bringing breakfast delights mint tea & even decorating us with her wonderful Henna skills she always had time to chat & smile what a charming lady. Rashid was a really great head waiter again happy to chat and explain life in marrakech so interesting to hear his tales and always there with drinks and service with a lovely smile. The food was outstanding we've eaten at some great restaurants around the world but this definitely held it's own. We enjoyed a lunch and 2 dinners during our stay and were never disappointed. Our last night we celebrated our daughters 21st and having already delivered chocolate cake for breakfast an amazing meal was served on the roof terrace on a table sprinkled with rose petals wonderful memories. Stefanias recommendations were great for days out and restaurants to visit. The roof terrace was delightful day and night.

Location is quiet ensuring good sleep however not really downtown in the Medina (10 - 15 min walk to the Djeema el Fna).    Only drawback during my stay were road construction works directly in front of the hotel resulting in some noise during the day and Problems with tap water provisioning on the first day.

The manager greets you by your first name - there is no formal check in process rather you sit for some tea and pastries in the atrium style courtyard of palm trees as you're taken through a brief history of the area and points of interest. You're given a mobile phone in case you need anything while you're out exploring and then you're shown to one of your rooms (being a Riad there are only a handful of them so you feel like you're a guest in someone's home) We stayed in the MANAR deluxe room - stunning! The decor is so true to Morocco with all the furniture beautifully appointed and a private terrace on a dual story. The service is friendly but discreet with our room being made up to perfection and then turned down in the evenings. Breakfast can be served in the courtyard on the rooftop or on your terrace it's delicious and unique to the area (they have a farm to table food philosophy) as are the meals and cocktails... With only a small kitchen the staff were unbelievably accommodating (we flew in late after their kitchen had closed but they still managed to put something delicious together for us and acted as though it was no trouble)  It was elegant but understated and exactly what we were looking for on our weekend getaway cannot recommend it enough nor can we fault it and will most definitely be back!,Date of stay: May 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChloeKAR

We were also very pleased with the surprise roses in our room on the second night.

72 Riad Living,Catherine wrote a review Apr 2015,50,Perfect Boutique Hotel,My husband and I have just got back from a 4 night stay at Riad 72. We could not be happier with our choice of hotel. The place was absolutely perfect and I wish we had gone there for our honeymoon as it was such a romantic place. Our room had a private balcony which was lovely to sit on relaxing with a drink in the sun but we had a look at a couple of other rooms and they were amazing too. I don't think you could go wrong with any room here. The breakfast is brilliant with fresh fruit salad and yoghurt alongside pastries. The staff are extremely attentive and we would say on par with a recent stay at 5* hotel.  We both booked a hamam at the hotel which was lovely and relaxing which we followed with a nice romantic meal in the hotel restaurant. I would definitely recommend doing this at least once during your stay.

72 Riad Living,jenny T wrote a review Apr 2015,50,Perfect!,My husband and I have just returned from a weekend break to Marrakech and Riad 72 made our stay perfect. From the minute we arrived until we reluctantly left their hospitality was second to none. Our room was beautiful the food delicious and sitting upstairs under the bamboo canopy bliss. The whole team were so helpful and friendly it was clear they took pride in the Riad and enjoyed working there. Stefania is lovely and goes the extra mile to ensure your stay is special. A special thank you to Asma who had a permanent smile on her face and always willing to help. It was my birthday whilst there and when we went down for breakfast happy birthday music was played and Asma had cut out 'happy birthday' in rose petals to put on the table. The chef then baked me a chocolate fondant and brought it out with a candle. I was completely taken aback and they made me feel very special all day. My husband had arranged for candles and rose petals in our room that night and again Asma made the room look absolutely beautiful - so much so that I was reluctant to get into bed and spoil it all!    If you are thinking of visiting Marrakech Riad 72 is a must. Very central but also very quiet they create the perfect atmosphere after a busy few hours around the souks etc. I cannot wait to visit again.,Date of stay: April 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Leicester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JennyT90
72 Riad Living,Charlotte M wrote a review Apr 2015,50,"An amazing location to stay, right in the hustle and bustle of the Medina, a real hidden charm!",We stayed at Riad 72 for three nights in April and it was truly a fantastic stay. On arrival to the Riad we were met by lovely staff who washed our hands and served mint tea and biscuits whilst briefing us on the local area and giving tips and advice for navigating around the Medina. We were then shown around the Riad and shown to our rooms where we had a bottle of red wine and a fruit basket waiting for us (courtesy of booking through Mr & Mrs Smith). The Riad is like a calm oasis hidden behind a huge door you would not realise you are staying somewhere right by the hustle and bustle of the Medina it was extremely quiet and peaceful. We stayed in two different rooms during our stay – the Maha Classic room (two nights) and the Zahwa Deluxe Room (one night). Both rooms were a great size for two people had nice comfortable beds and good size bathrooms (although the Maha Classic room could probably do with better lights in the bedroom as it was quite dark even with all the lights on). The Riad had a lovely courtyard area dining room and roof terrace where you could have breakfast/ lunch/ dinner and the food at the Riad was lovely. The staff at the Riad could be described as a close-knit family who couldn’t do more for you to ensure that you enjoy your stay they thought of everything down to the last detail and were extremely friendly providing service with a smile at all times. We also had treatments during our stay – a hammam and a body massage. The hammam was a truly amazing experience which we would tell anyone to have whilst in Marrakech and the one we had in the Riad was fantastic. It leaves your skin extremely soft like a new skin! Overall we couldn’t recommend this Riad enough and we will certainly be going back.,Date of stay: April 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/charlottem873

The staff is always available to direct you to a taxi as you get around Marrakech. Our room was dramatically beautiful and spacious and it included a lavish bathroom. We ordered wine and Artisanal cheese into room in the evenings which were an excellent treat! We also enjoyed a hommum bath and massage there which was delicious.

72 Riad Living,Georgina S wrote a review Mar 2015,50,"Arrived As strangers , left as friends!",if you are searching through trip advisor for a fabulous place to stay in Marrakech you're search has come to an end. We have stayed in amazing 5 star hotels around the world but have never encountered service like this.  Firstly the facilities-  Arrival is through a big wooden door leading to a wonderful fresh courtyard housing full size Palm trees & a modern soothing fountain. This is an oasis only 5 minutes from the hassle of the souks.  We literally booked a few days before and had the last room . It was a deluxe double with a lovely walk in shower bathroom . Best part of this room though is that it has its own private staircase leading up to a private terrace. We took tea here everyday morning & afternoon & it was bliss. There is also another larger terrace with very comfortable sun beds. Very high up so not overlooked this is quite a consideration in a Muslim country. I had a look at several other rooms & each one is completely individually decorated in a modern Moroccan style to the highest standard. On the ground floor is the restaurant & the hammam. We ate here on the first evening & spent the other 5 evenings trying to find a restaurant as good. Wish we'd eaten here every night. The food is simply fabulous the table was strewn with rose petals & the service phenomenal without being intrusive. You can take breakfast anywhere you wish but the courtyard seems perfect for it. It consists of something different everyday day starting with juice yogurt fresh butter & goats cheese fruits several different cakes or french toast etc.  The hammam can be pre booked & a girl comes in & does the scrub. Never felt so clean!  The staff- what can I say ? From the beautiful Stefania the manager who looks like she stepped of the pages of Italian Vogue to Asmas big smile & Rashids impeccable service. Medo  my friend! These people are trained by the Italian owner to second guess what the guests will want without being intrusive. I don't think you could ask for anything that they wouldn't try to accommodate.  We were very sorry to leave after 5 days & I can't wait to revisit with my daughter. We arrived tired & weary & left happy & warm.  Ladies be respectful  skirts to the knee & covered shoulders .  Marrakech is a completely safe country to be in never once felt scared or threatened .

72 Riad Living,mark_watts99 wrote a review Mar 2015,50,Perfectly positioned to discover Marrakech,If you are a curious first time visitor or seasoned veteran of the Souks Riad 72 is the perfect accompaniment to any trip to Marrakech. Ideally positioned as an entrance to the bustle of the Souks the must see Jmaa el finna and the nightlife of Guerliz the riad is a perfect example of refined elegance. The entrance leads you to a beautifully tranquil courtyard complete with high rising palm trees sheltering the hidden alcoves and the amazing grand salon which comes into its  own at night especially when candlelit. The rooms are spacious with high ceilings and finished with a mix of locally sourced objects and European vintage furniture with the Amal and Karma suites both being great examples. Another of the main draws of Riad 72 is the service everyone has a smile and always a willingness to help all this adds to the overall ambience and charm that the riad excudes.

From the booking (via the hotel's website) the arranged pick-up @ the airport the personal and very warm and welcoming reception by Stefania in the breathtaking courtyard to the amenities in our well designed room we felt taken care of 100 %.    The owners of this little gem paid particular attention to every little detail when converting the old Riad into a boutique hotel.    We weree greeted personally by lovely Stefania who answered all our - even unspoken - questions about Marrakech and all whereabouts you should know as a first time visitor to Marrakech. Personally I was impressed by the mobile phones provided in every room with the hotel's number on speed dial! (Not sure if this kind of opposed the confirmation by our host that the city is totally save... I guess it's more about the dangers of getting lost in the labyrinth of the Souk whilst hunting for some treasures to take home with you.)    The rooftop is another bonus point for this place - with a 360 degrees view of Marrakech up to the Atlas mountains.    We will definitely come back.

72 Riad Living,mlen14 wrote a review Jan 2015,50,Absolutely Delightful,My husband and I stayed at Riad 72 for 5 nights in January to celebrate a milestone birthday. We researched countless riads before picking Riad 72 and we could not have been happier with our choice.    The lovely Italian manager Stephania and every member of the stellar staff were truly delightful exceptionally helpful and made us feel at home right from the start. The service was impeccable. The riad is very well located - we walked absolutely everywhere - and we were glad to find it was in a quiet part of the medina. It is also very clean unlike some other riads that we saw that were a bit on the shabby side. The breakfasts were to die for and the intimate restaurant is sublime. We ordered the 6 hour tangia and lamb barbecue which were absolutely delicious. Waking up to birds chirping was so very calming as was the hammam with Aisha which was one of the highlights of the stay.    The best part of the entire experience was the room - the Karma Suite. With sky high wooden ceilings with a carved cupola that lets in little slivers of light it is incredibly spacious and beautifully designed in a Morrocco -meets -Italy sublime sort of way. The room is absolutely vast but is still incredibly intimate with countless seating areas which was very important to us as my husband often preferred to lounge in the room while I was off shopping in the souks. The room is an incredible value. We had gone to the El Fenn riad for lunch and actually saw their top of the line pool suite (which is more than twice the price of the Karma suite) and found that the Karma suite was not only more spacious and clean but it was much more beautiful as well. Stephania told us that it is one of the most photographed rooms in Marrakech and for good reason! It is the ultimate in relaxed luxury. All the other rooms in the riad are beautiful as well you can't go wrong with any of them but if you can book the Karma suite.    We plan to go back to Riad 72 (or their sister property Riad Due) someday next time with the entire extended family.

72 Riad Living,John H wrote a review Dec 2014,50,Riad 72 - Real Luxury in the Real Marrakech,My wife and several of her friends had previously dined at Riad 72 and were so impressed that we took a short pre-Christmas break with my business partner and his wife at the Riad.    In my opinion Riad 72 is certainly luxury but I would call it real luxury rather than the pretend glitzy hotels like La Maison Arabe. It's feels more solidly old money than new money. Special. Memorable. A feeling of the real glamour and style of Marrakech.    The Welcome  After being whisked from the airport to the corner of Bab Doukkala by Riad 72's own private taxi you are met by the ever-trusty and friendly Aziz (who also ensures the complete security of the Hotel at night) and then it is a trundle through the nearby streets and passageways to the Riad which is like an oasis of calm and privacy within the city. They greet you with fresh (and it is properly fresh !) mint tea and biscuits and Stephanie provides a tour of the hotel and provides whatever information you need.    The Hotel  An old Riad with the classic central private 'atrium' sporting mature palms banana plants and cactii. The rooms are all very private and blessedly the morning call to prayer cannot be readily heard through the thick walls. By contrast the roof terrace of the Riad is probably the best in the city as it is higher than any other around and you get a fascinating buzz of You can relax there all day if you want soak up the sun in privacy and eat delicious salads and cakes whilst getting a wide view of the the souks the Atlas Mountains and the rooftops.    The Rooms  All very individual with a smooth almost marble-like interiors (but with radiators putting out fine heat in winter!) - comfy large beds and on all but perhaps 'Amal' extremely quiet (though Amal does have the biggest bath I have ever bathed in - you actually float as if in a small swimming pool). Plenty of towels and toiletries a very useful wifi and 'docking' station no TV (hurrah!) and areas to sit and reflect with a glass of wine or two. The central atrium allows the local finches to chirrup in the morning as they pick at bananas - a great sound.    The Dining  Probably the BEST bit. As Stephanie the Manager explained to us the italian owners insist on Head Chef Mustapha and his assistants using fresh ingriedients and I witnessed myself the attention to detail in the kitchen. Event he vegetables are just incredible - succulent Courgettes crisp potato and carrots and the tagine is a proper 6 hour job cooked in an earthenware pot. The background music is cool and sassy. Go with Rachid the Maitre'D and his suggestions - especially on wine. We did venture out to the Maison Arabe (it's a 10 minute walk) and whilst that offers a different evening atmosphere the food is not as good as Riad 72.    Many thanks to Asma Rachid Mustapha the Chef Aziz and Stephanie the Manager.    We will be back for a week next time and cannot wait to try the rest of the menu.

72 Riad Living,Nicki G wrote a review Nov 2014,50,Stylish luxury in the medina,My partner and I have just returned from a short break in Marrakech staying at Riad 72. We stayed in the Amal deluxe room with a huge kind size bed. The bathroom was well appointed with a large bath and 'his and hers' sinks. We booked a taxi to collect us from the airport (very worth while as would have been difficult to find otherwise) and as we were arriving late had ordered dinner to be ready for us. We have the fantastic tasting menu well worth it and the breakfasts were also superb. From my initial e-mail contacts with the owner through to having henna applied by Asma (one of the staff) everyone was faultless in their service. I cannot recommend Riad 72 highly enough.,Date of stay: November 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Bristol, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nickig108
72 Riad Living,Lea R wrote a review Oct 2014,50,A slice of heaven in the medina,Riad 72 is one of the best hotel experiences we have enjoyed in our many travels. A tranquil oasis with a sunlit courtyard opening to the sky. The rooms were incredible in every detail mixing the modern with the old. Beautiful carved wood ceilings and adornment yet mixed with modern details and fixtures. Besides being a beautiful place to stay they have a beautiful roof top terrace with sunset views and one can dine on the roof under the stars or in two additional areas in the lower courtyard. In addition this Riad has the best staff we have ever encountered. Rashid was there to help with every detail from serving our drinks and dinners to helping us with answers to every question. The house manager is a lovely Italian woman Stephana who helped to make this our best yet hotel experience in Morocco. If there was a rating higher than five stars they would qualify.,Date of stay: October 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"San Miguel de Allende, Mexico",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeaR148

72 Riad Living,olivia p wrote a review Oct 2014,50,Perfect!,We stayed for a week at Riad 72 and had an amazing experience.    The building is beautiful and is a real oasis within the medina. The courtyard is lovely and the roof terrace is particularly nice to enjoy a nice drink and watch the sunset. The riad is more contemporary than your average riad but it still retains some traditional features. We stayed in the Amal room which I would highly recommend; the bed was huge very comfy and the linen was lovely quality also the air-conditioning worked great bath robes provided and towels for use on the terrace and perhaps the highlight of the room was the most amazing bath I have ever seen made from traditional Moroccan tadelakt and about 8ft long! Nice touches like the fresh white roses left in our room along with fresh fruit that was replenished each day were lovely. The handmade ghassoul soap and the other complementary toiletries were more than the run-of-the-mill stuff. The housekeeping was the best I have experienced - the room was cleaned beautifully each day. The free bottles of water were much welcomed. Breakfast was good and consisted mainly of fruit yoghurt preserves and a variety of moroccan cakes pastries and bread. We enjoyed it although perhaps a small negative was that after a few days the heavy and sugar laden breakfast started to become a little hard to eat and we would've preferred something a little lighter and savoury.  I think the main point to make about this riad is the service - Stefania is a fantastic manager who is very enthusiastic to help you in whatever way possible. We were given a mobile phone with the numbers of Stefania and the riad on - although we didn't use it it was nice to know we had it as Marrakech medina can be very daunting and difficult to navigate. It was little touches like this that made our stay. The staff could not have been any better particularly Aziz and Asma who worked so hard to ensure we were happy and felt at home.

72 Riad Living,Archdeacon wrote a review Sep 2014,50,A truly outstanding Marrakech experience,Quality service doesn't come better than this. Stefania the Italian manager of the property (it is also owned by an equally charming Italian lady) is a delightful caring and resourceful leader of a truly outstanding staff team. We were amazed by the consistently high levels of warm caring service we received. The staff were all in their different ways truly a delight. Riad 72 is in the heart of the Medina. This is important because the heat and activity of the Medina can be taxing oppressive even exhausting - however fascinating and stimulating in other ways Marrakech can be. In our view circumstances like these demand an oasis. We certainly found one in Riad 72. The Riad is beautiful calm and wonderfully hospitable. The food (unlike much of Marrakech be warned) is very good - freshly and imaginatively prepared and graciously served. The building itself was once a palace. The courtyard is especially lovely and the few rooms are large nicely appointed comfortable with welcome and effective air conditioning. The fine quality linen is changed every day and a great deal of effort is taken by the staff. We had fresh fruit and large vases of red roses to adorn our room. Another very nice and much appreciated touch was the offer of chilled mineral water on demand and without extra charge. In the very hot weather day and night this is all part of the oasis experience. Thank you to Stefania Rachid Asma in particular and the other kindly people on staff. Thank you too to Secret Escapes for introducing us to a truly outstanding Marrakech experience.,Date of stay: September 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Cambridgeshire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Archdeacon
72 Riad Living,harifamily wrote a review Aug 2014,50,Riad 72,Riad 72 is a nice B&B inside the Medina of Marrakech. Like all other Riads the location is a little difficult to get to at least initially. Hence they send a car to pick you up at the airport. But once you enter the Riad it is an oasis of beauty and peace. The staff members led by Stefania are excellent. Fully devoted to customer satisfaction!! Stefania goes way beyond words to ensure that the guests have a comfortable stay and have an excellent vacation. Food is excellent though we only had lunch and continental breakfast. Rooms are clean and airy. All the major attractions are within walking distance and if one takes a day trip outside Marrakech Stefania arranges with very little fuss.  Great Riad and will always have pleasant memories of the stay.

While in Marrakech however we decided to spend a bit more and stay at Riad 72 - and we didn't regret it for a second!    Riad 72 is perfect. The location is close enough to walk to anything you want to get to but far enough away that you don't feel like you're walking out into the thick of it the moment you step out the door.    Our room was gorgeous. The bathroom was our favourite part - the bathtub must have been 7 feet long - and everything down to the soaps and shampoos made our stay absolutely perfect.    The rooftop patio is the perfect spot to have a glass of wine and watch the sunset which we did a couple of times.    The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful and we felt like we were being welcomed home every time we returned.    Highly recommend Riad 72!

Our cases vanished to our rooms (thanks Aziz!) and we sat under the banana tree in the courtyard where our hands were washed with warm water poured over from a brass jar over a basin before we were given mint tea to relax us. We then got a brief info of our location and what was nearby and what to do where to go where to eat etc.  There are only 4 rooms in this riad and so it was really peaceful. Sadly we only had 2 nights and so did not get to do the cookery course we could have done as the food here was amazingly good. Everyone was so helpful and nothing was too much trouble. We also stayed in El Fenn and while we loved it too both experiences were totally different. We would return to both for different reasons.

72 Riad Living,Naniwa wrote a review Apr 2014,50,A sanctuary amidst a chaotic city,"Before arriving in Marrakech I read the reviews and thought ""what are people banging on about?"" when they spoke of their riad being a peaceful haven in a crazy city. Surely everyone was being a touch dramatic? How wrong I was. Marrakech is one of the most frantic bustling overwhelming and (at times) difficult places we have visited. It can be tiring but it's not without its compensations. Make no mistake this is a place that can assault your senses and live your head spinning. So all the more reason to choose your lodgings carefully.    Riad 72 was virtually perfect in every way. From start to finish we were treated with respect and kindness. Met at our car our luggage was loaded into a small cart and pushed through the manic scenes of the medina. In less than five minutes we were in and sitting down in the peaceful courtyard. Replete with banana trees shrubs and a fountain we sat down and were welcomed with Moroccan tea whilst small birds landed on our table in the hope of getting a crumb or two from the delicious homemade biscuits. Matteo then explained to us everything we needed to know using a map to show us some good restaurants and sites of interest and highlighting the best routes to and from the riad.    Our room - the Karma Suite - was somewhere we could really unwind. A great skylight that added atmosphere. A place where we could sit with a book and let time pass. Not that we did that too often but it is important to have a place to rest before heading back out into the city. If you have one of the smaller rooms there are still plenty of spaces to relax such as the courtyard or the rooftop terrace (which on a clear day affords spectacular views across the city towards the Atlas Mountains).    The food in the riad is particularly noteworthy. The breakfasts (with slight variations on each of our mornings) really set us up for the day. Fresh fruit salad yoghurts breads and fantastic cheese. Different kinds of pancakes too. We ordered two dinners during our stay and didn't regret it. Slightly more pricey than some parts of town but you get what you pay for. And you don't need to order too much (we had a starter each and shared a main and then had dessert and felt satisfied). There are plenty of options in the town (and some good recommendations from the riad) but do reserve at least one meal on site.    We were given assistance to arrange a day trip to Ait Benhaddou (a world heritage site some way to the south... a long drive through the mountains and then desert but a good place to go). All completely open and transparent - there was no secret that the cost was higher than had we gone to the main square and arranged through a tout but we were assured that the guide would be competent and that the transport would be safe clean and modern. It ticked all the boxes and we were very grateful for the staff at Riad 72 for arranging everything we wanted at such short notice.    Overall a great place to stay. The city will not be to everyone's taste but we were glad we came and experienced everything on offer (the good and the not so good). What was beyond reproach was Riad 72. Every member of staff was friendly and couldn't do enough to help. Most spoke English (very helpful if French or Arabic are not in your repertoire). We would recommend the place without hesitation and would stay here again should we ever head back to Marrakech. If you are heading this way give this place a go... you're unlikely to be disappointed.",Date of stay: March 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Richmond-upon-Thames, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Naniwa

Unlike some of the other riads we visited during our stay in Marrakech and throughout Morocco Riad 72 has a sleek sexy feel to it. Rooms have poured concrete showers luxury bath products and very comfortable beds. The bathroom in our room was open to the the bed area so I would recommend that anyone bothered by having both bathroom and bedroom combined select a room with a separate washroom and toilet. Service here could not have been better. All of the staff was extremely gracious helpful and among the frendliest that we encountered throughout our trip.

We had dinner on one night in the riad and pre ordered fish. When we sat down we were not offered a starter or a desert and just given the fish and veg. We were totally left alone!!!

This was recommended by a friend who stayed here previously and i am glad i took him up on the recommendation.    We went as a family whilst there on a break and were seated in the dining room to ourselves. The Chef Fatuma prepares a menu daily based on what she has found whilst shopping in the markets and every course was delightful. I am a carnivore and think meat needs to be in most courses but even the vegetarian course she prepared were amazing. We enjoyed some drinks with the meal and the price overall for this i could not believe due to how reasonable it was.

72 Riad Living,DodgerW3 wrote a review Nov 2013,50,Boutique hotel lover's boutique hotel,"The boutique hotel lover's boutique hotel. Well strictly speaking it is a Riad which as the discerning traveller knows is a courtyard with luxiorious plants and foliage surrounded by cloistered paths and balconies and often with roof terraces. Riad 72 is all of this and more at the top of the range.  We booked a package which included room huge marble bathrom balcony hammam and massage dinner collection from the airport and champagne on arrival. It wasn't cheap but worth every penny we spent as the quality of everything was just superb. There are only four rooms well room does seem an understatment so we considered oursleves lucky to have got in for the exact time we wanted.  The welcome is just great. Walk out of arrivals at Marrakech airport and there is a driver waiting for you to take you in some comfort to as near as possible to the Arset Awzel. You're met by a handsomely kitted out porter who loads your cases onto his handcart for the 3 minute walk to paradise. Marrakech is all about narrow streets and what we'd call blind alleys but left right and left and we're outside a front door. It's seemingly one of many and the thought goes through your head about all those pictures from the website and the space. Fear not they are there for Marrakech is Moroccan for magic and quicker than saying ""Ali Baba"" the luxury the sights the space and the comfort wrap themselves round you like a luxorious soft blanket.  Over mint tea we are given the potted guide of the Riad and what we can look forward to. There are helpful hints of sights to see and things to do. Maps are given out and guide books and we head up to the roof balcony for our first nocturnal view of the city. The lights shimmer for us in the evening heat and the tall towers of the mosques soon become evident.  We found the meals all brilliant. Breakfast is a leisurely served feast of local fruits juices and yogurts with breads sweet and savoury cakes and pancakes and rich strong coffee. Dinner is a choice of tagines but beware they are huge with easily enough for two people in one dish. It's worth booking the dinner when you can to give the staff as much notice as possible. They are all so nice and keen to please and are so pleased when you ask for their help with language and customs. It's a bit like being in a family home for everyone.  One little warning though you are in an Islamic country and the Riad is close to a number of mosques with regular calls to the faithful to prayer. These can be in the very small hours of the morning well night then but you soon get used to them. There is the added bonus of being gently woken by the dawn chorus of birds who have the decency of hour to nudge you into the day arond breakfast time.  The Riad highlight? The hammam and massage. It is an experince worth the trip and was like nothing else we've ever had in the UK. The whole experience was enervating cleansing and exciting. It is a must.

72 Riad Living,MXE wrote a review Oct 2013,50,"Lovely calm environment, great staff.",Riad 72 exudes class and calmness. A less is more design ethic that is refreshing compared to the ornate repetitive nature of the cities many other Riads (not that we didn't enjoy visiting them too - it was just always a pleasure to come home to Riad 72). The traditional furniture and elements are still all there just more carefully curated... Each of the four rooms is unique- the smallest is still elegantly furnished comfortably sized and with unique and special features. Anybody would lucky to stay in any of them!    The roof terrace is beautiful and the cool water plunge pool (like a large bath) is an awesome feature when temperatures were around 35- 40 degrees. The roof terrace is the highest of any of the properties for some distance giving fantastic views and a sense of privacy and quiet in an otherwise vibrant city. Great for reading relaxing and breakfast.    Service is great - all front of house staff and the chef were amazing to us - making every experience special.,Date of stay: September 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Birmingham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MXE

However this riad relived their anxiety for this trip. We loved the decollation of our room and the reading space. Even towels were nice moroccan style!    The stuffs are so kind and they had great hospitality as 5 stars hotel!    We had lunch in here but my parents and aunt are not used to eat short pasta. The stuff went to buy a spaghetti and they cooked our lunch as tender.  When my father fell and cut his arm deeply they gave him first aid very quick.  I very much appreciate your kindness that made our trip perfect!    この様なホスピタリティあふれるリヤドはモロッコでは珍しいかと思います。  食べやすいスパゲッティを買ってきてくださり、少し深い傷の手当もして頂き、両親も不安ではなかった様です。  お酒もありますし、夜は静かで、とてもリラックスできました。外に出ると旧市街の土色の町並み、そして日常があり、とても楽しい場所でした。,Date of stay: August 2013,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Tokyo, Japan",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sogno1121

Collected from the airport the porter waiting to take our bags through the narrow alleyways; bags put in our fabulous rooms and mint tea and delicious biscuits served in a beautiful courtyard surrounded by palm trees; after months of miserable weather in the UK to be in the warm with clear blue skies - heavenly!  Superb attentive service at all times. Delicious breakfasts with jugs of freshly squeezed orange juice. Clean and very comfortable rooms. We enjoyed the roof terrace where we had supper on the first night and as the evening was so clear we could see the Atlas Mountains in the distance.

72 Riad Living,Hawksforflag wrote a review Jul 2013,50,Serenity found!,"Apparently all good things come to those who wait and in this instance must also apply to those who walk around in circles trying to find Riad 72.After some false starts from 'helpful"" locals we were in no doubt as to why the maze of alleys would in years bygone have confused would be invaders into moving on to an easier place to ransack.Close to exasperation and exhaustion we finally got some directions that worked.Once we had found it we never had any problems finding our way back.  What a beautiful sanctuary and what fantastic staff.So helpfulcaring and utterly charming.They all worked so well as a team to make our stay so memorable.  This was our last place to stay in Marrakesh having stayed 4 nights at La Mamounia and 3 nights at El Fenn.Both the places were exceptional but Riad 72 just had a simple yet elegant charm and serenity to it.  The internal central courtyard is tastefully decorated with a Moroccan influence and Italian eye for style.We sat and enjoyed a very refreshing and by this time necessary bottle of chilled water and cool hand towels whilst we checked in.We had left our luggage at El Fenn and the staff at Riad 72 arranged for it to be collected and delivered to our room.  Our room was a loft style room and you need to be reasonably sure of foot to climb the stairs that don't hav handrails.The bed was firm but comfortable. The bathroom well proportioned and functional but a bit light on for storing toiletries.Everything was very clean.Airconditioning was quiet and effective.  The roof top terrace whilst not as expansive as El Fenns' was still a very enjoyable spot to be.There was a very small plunge pool but we didn't take the plunge.  Breakfast and dinner can be taken on the terrace and we did both.Breakfast had the standard fare which included delicious croissants  baguettes fresh orange juice.  Dinner was absolutely magnificent on the two occasions we dined in.We had the terrace to ourselves on both occasions.A beautiful old lady prepares the meal and you can request you favourite Moroccan dishes or leave it to her to design a 3 or more course dinner.The kitchen is in a room off the courtyard and you can see your meal being prepared from mid afternoon.Like everything elsethe kitchen is spotless.It was so memorable being on the terrace as the sunset commenced and the enchanting evening prayer calls began resonating from the various towers within our view.It is worth staying just to enjoy this experience of quintessential Moroccan cookingsights and sounds.  We wanted to have a hit of golf and the staff booked us in at Royal Marrakech Golf Course and arranged for a driver to take us there and back with a bit of a sightseeing tour on the return.  We liked some of the linens and decorations at the Riad so much that we asked the staff if they could be bought locally.Fortunately they could and within a short walk we were taken to an amazing 3 storey Aladdins Cave stocked with furniturerugslightscooking utensilswall hangings and more.It was not your typical tourist trap.It was not signposted and unless you knew what was behind the non descript solid wooden front doors you would have no reason to enter.Fortunately we were shown inside without having to utter""open Sesame"".Inside the emporium were mainly locals .We bought a few things but would love to have had the luggage space to buy more.Hopefully we will get the chance to do so one day.  Within the riad there is a small hammam.My wife enjoyed the hammam whilst i had a massage.The massage was pretty standard but my wife thought the hammam was an amazing experience . Whilst the surrounds may not have been as opulent as the hammam she enjoyed at La Mamounia the overall treatment was superior and more authentic.  Would certainly not hesitate recommending Riad 72 and hope to return one day.Although the labyrinth of souks are within a couple of hundred metres which is greatit was fantastic to be able to return to serenity from the hectic hustle and bustle of the souk and El Fna.",Date of stay: May 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Melbourne, Australia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hawksforflag

The Riad has four double rooms dining room central courtyard (complete with dining areas palm trees and water feature) and a sun terrace including a plunge pool and covered dining area. The whole Riad is stylishly furnished and decorated with a combination of classical and contemporary furnishings and fittings.

The Riad provides an atmosphere of great calm after the buzz and energy of the Medina it is much larger than we imagined. Our room was very quirky and on two levels it had everything we wanted. The courtyardroof terrace and other areas were excellent. We had dinner in the courtyard of the Riad on the first night and we highly recommend it superb food and service.

72 Riad Living,charlotte m wrote a review May 2013,50,a sea of tranquillity in an explosion of excitement,It is impossible to convey the level of service you get in this fantastic Riad. Nothing is too much trouble There are only 4 rooms in this beautiful palace like building so you feel like you have the place to your self a lot of the time.It feels like you are at home in your very own mansion being waited on hand and foot.    The food is second to none and the wine is also good. Contrary to a previous review you do not have to have a full 3 course meal and can choose how many courses you want. In my opinion the service surpasses that of a five star hotel. Only the smallest room was left when we booked but even that was lovely.    It is far better to stay in the Medina because you acclimatize yourself to the the bustle and excitement that is Marrakesh and can enjoy it rather than being overwhelmed. So Riad 72 is perfect. It is in a less touristy area with its own little souk and you can get an idea of real life in the city. Yet is is bang smack next to all the action. Don't listen to people who tell you to stay in the modern part of the city. You will really miss out on the experience if you don't stay in the Medina.    The hotel organised an official guide for us on the first day and I would really recommend this. It was brilliant we saw all the sights without being hassled and after that we had got our bearings and could navigate around like seasoned travelers.    Alcohol is not on general sale in Marrakesh so if you like a drink it is essential to stay somewhere like this that serves alcohol.,Date of stay: May 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/charlottem513

Dinner on the rooftop terrace on our first night was a perfect way to start our trip. Great value for money and absolutely beautiful rooms with lots of common space to relax in when the streets outside get a bit too hectic.    While it doesn't have a pool a lovely water feature in the courtyard and a little pond on the terrace to dip your feet would help keep you cool.    Not a great deal of privacy for the bathroom but comparable to many other places of the style.

72 Riad Living,SandyW217 wrote a review Apr 2013,50,A vertiable oasis in the middle of the medina in Marrakesh,From the moment we stepped into Riad 72 we knew that we were in for something special. There is a real sense of tranquility that owes as much to the refined tastefulness of the refurbishment of the riad as it does to the outstanding personlised service of all the staff. This is a boutique hotel at its best. No request however small was too much trouble. The strawberries that we brought back from the market which we asked to be washed appeared beautifully prepared moments later with a home made orange syrup and artisan yoghurt on the side. Dinners were outstanding and breakfast served on the rooftop terrace overlooking the medina and with spectacular views to the snow capped Atlas mountains was the perfect way to start the day. Time spent in the kitchen one afternoon with Habiba learning how to create some of the Moroccan dishes she serves was a highlight. Cristian who manages Riad 72 was extremely helpful and informative providing not only valuable advice on where to go and what to see but also offering insights into the cultural and historical aspects of Morocco. The room we stayed in although one of the smaller rooms was extremely tastefully appointed with everything we needed...again the attention to detail was exquisite.

72 Riad Living,rorcster wrote a review Apr 2013,30,Quirky and Central,The hotel has a good location in the old town just north west of the main souk. The staff are very helpful and several of them speak good english. It's certainly worth organising airport transfers with the hotel as it is not on a main street and would be difficult to find particularly if like us you are on your first visit to Marrakech.    Inside the hotel is an oasis of cool tranquility much needed after a morning in the souk! The decor is quirky but classy and the rooms are comfortable. Of note both the rooms we stayed in had only a curtain to separate the sleeping area from the bathroom. Probably not a place for new couples on a first holiday!    Breakfast is continental however many of the pastries are deep fried which becomes hard work after a few days. I would advise avoiding the evening meals in the hotel. Although the food is of a reasonable standard it was not made clear at the time of booking or on the menu that eating in involves a set menu of three courses this works out to be very expensive indeed. It is certainly possible to get better Moroccan food elsewhere for a better price.    Overall this is a comfortable reasonably priced hotel in a good location ideal if you want to stay somewhere a bit different and not break the bank. I would however advise avoiding evening meals in the hotel.,Date of stay: October 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Cardiff,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rorcster

We can't emphasise enough just how beautiful and tranquil Riad 72 is an oasis of calm against the hustle an bustle of such a vibrant city.  The rooms are fabulous each with there own unique features from a bath that you could fit a group in to an elegant mezzanine suite. We slept like babies in our huge bed surrounded by fluffy pillows lulled to sleep by the rustle of banana palms and song's of birds outside in the courtyard.  We chose to eat our first breakfast on the roof and what a delight it was an array of pastries fruit breads and homemade preserves served with our choice of fresh orange juice and mint tea; all whilst we gazed over the views of the city with the Atlas mountains off in the distance.  We ate at the Riad for two of our three nights in the city as the food was so delicious Fatima and the entire team really do go above and beyond and made each meal a delight.

Whether arriving for the first time or returning from a day of Marrakech madness from the moment you step through the huge wooden door you are transported to an oasis of calm and beauty. The Riad is beautiful in every detail. It doesn't try to recreate the feel of the kasbah in the way some of the riads do it reflects the taste and style of its Italian owner with an influence of Morrocco fine art and luxuary.  Eat at the Riad. Tables are prepared in the courtyard of the riad but you can also choose to eat on the roof terrace or in the lounge. Fatima prepares wonderful traditional food in the little kitchen adjacent to the courtyard. You don't choose your menu you are treated to a succession of tasty dishes. I have eaten in a number of good restaurants in Marrakech but the food and atmosphere in the riad is the best.  The food is matched by the quality of service which is sublime.  Marrakech is an expereince not to be missed but the conversation on the way home was all about the riad the food and the lovely people at riad 72.

It's a beautiful place tucked away in the Medina maybe 10 minutes walk from the crazy chaos (in a good way) of the main square...and it's a welcome oasis of calm to return to after tramping around the souks. Our room (the Karma suite) was huge with a beautiful high wooden ceiling.    The fantastic Christian and his capable team (Aziz Rashid and others) have perfected the art of of low key but attentive and friendly service. English is spoken but if you're a French (or Arabic) speaker then obviously even better. Absolutely nothing was too much trouble for them the ever smiling Aziz even walked us to one of the main restaurants when we were fretting about finding it. I was pleased he came we would have got lost! If I had a minor criticism it would be that to order a beer on the roof terrace you had to go all the way to the bottom to find a member of staff. But that sounds incredibly lazy now that I've read that back.    And finally the food- it's really really good. In fact I'd say we didn't eat as well as we did in the Riad so make sure you book. The lemon olive and chicken was really great. And to top it all the breakfasts: we didn't eat the same thing twice and it was all made in house. Drinking fresh OJ on the roof terrace overlooking this ancient city will be a memory that long stays with me. Will definitely come back and stay in the peaceful beautiful place.,Date of stay: March 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markhuckerby

Riad 72 is tucked away in the narrow alleyways of a quiet part of town. Thankfully a taxi was arranged to pick us up as there was no way we would have ever found it without local knowledge. I am in truth loathe to recommend this riad as I fear it will become ""too"" popular and may spoil but here goes .... the riad itself is a fantastic old building with just four suites. We were lucky enough to spend three blissful nights in a tastefully decorated suite boasting a massive kingsize bed and an amazing bathroom with a tub that easily accommodated my 6 foot frame (stretched out)!. The fact that this place gets the basics right is only the start. The little touches like fresh red roses in the room high end boutique pillows rose petals on the dinner table etc. make a real difference. For me there are three main reasons why Riad 72 should be the only option in Marrakech Due to its size and intimacy it really feels like you have the place to yourself most of the time which is fantastic for such a top class establishment complete with massive roof terrace which is ideal for taking breakfast. This brings me on to point two which is the food - the home cooked freshly prepared food here is amazing (I am a big foodie but could not bring myself to eat anywhere else for 2 of the 3 nights) Fatima serves up phenomenal treats and her meatball and egg tagine is world class not too mention freshly prepared pastries freshly squuezed orange juice and premium coffee every morning for breakfast - Superb!

We stayed in the Amal room which was beautiful and had the biggest bed and most amazing stone bath. Little touches like bottles of water and fresh fruit and flowers added extra comfort. The roof terrace is fantastic and on our first day we had a delicious traditional three course lunch served shortly after we arrived (book ahead) in a beautiful covered dining area overlooking the atlas mountains with intermittent calls to prayer breaking the distant sounds of the city. There is plenty of room for sunbathing a lovely little plunge pool to cool off. Breakfast was amazing and consisted of fresh juice and more freshly baked pastries and breads then you could ever eat. All food was cooked by Fatima the in house cook who is incredibly talented. All of the staff and the manager were so friendly and helpful with nothing being too much trouble.

Its decor gardens and terrace are so perfectly decorated that one feels immediately calmed while simultaneously experiencing the charms of Moroccan decor: color pillows iron work palm trees justting up thru the ceiling. With only 4 rooms the hotel truly starts to feel like one's home. A fact that the charming and incredibly warm staff will remind you of constantly "" you are home whatever you like.""    The unexpectedly fun aspect of this riad truly was the staff. They take the word ""doting"" to a new level and went above and beyond to ensure we felt at home. As two American women we felt a bit nervous when going out from time to time and Rashid and Norman were always more than willing to escort us call taxis arrange guides etc. We were always welcomed back from our day with warm mint tea and cookies and a smile.

It does not rely on opulence to reflect its luxury - its underatated simplicity in elegantly restored spaces does it all for you. Modern conveniences such as air-con etc are all there. No TV but goodness I hope that you can survive without one with this type of holiday....  A particular gem is to be had with the afternoon worker Rashid. My goodness - are there no bounds to his generousity of time knowledge and patience? His off-sider Shira as well as the lovely morning chef were incredibly accommodating polite friendly and smiling and were a joy to return or wake up to...  The view on the terrace is lovely. The food is great. The service is first rate and genuine. The location is central but also in the heart of the medina - isnt that what you came here for - to have that experience of being in the historic quarter of a millenium-old city????,Date of stay: August 2012,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Sydney, Australia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/turkiyem
72 Riad Living,CaryHOfm wrote a review Aug 2012,50,A haven in the Medina with plunge pool and caring service,Perfectly situated just inside the Medina on the same side as Place Jma el Fna. Very easy to walk to taxi stand. 2 minutes drive to The Place. They organise airport transfers. Rhislaine welcomed us into this hidden haven and in her gentle way made sure we were comfortable at all times. We enjoyed a lovely traditional meal cooked by Habiba on the roof terrace...3 stories up for each course thank you Rhislaine! For info prices are European at Eur60 for our 3 course meal for two. But how much better than going to a restaurant. Great terrace overlooking Marrakech rooftops with a plunge pool in which we spent Sundown hour with the champagne we took along with us. Comfy Teak loungers. Our 'luxury' room with split level was pretty but if I returned to Riad 72 (which I would happily) I would opt for the standard room or the suite on one level. Hmmm bed was very hard with just one pillow. Ask for a second one! Lovely quality fittings in the big bathroom. Gorgeous public area banana palms cooling fountain birds fluttering around. Highly recommended.,Date of stay: August 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Colmar, France",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CaryHOfm

Everything about the hotel the design and the staff is perfect. The hotel director Emanuella is a pleasure to deal with and made everything in her power to make our stay stress free and funRachid is so respectful pleasant and kind and so is Aziz and the rest of the staff. In terms of food well where do we start? After eating in several places in Marrakech we can only confirm previous reviews where food is exquisite all due to the wonderful cook Fatouma who is not only adorable but has a quality of a 5 star international chef.

We ate at the Riad on our first night which was delicious and huge portions. We stayed in Amal room which was a great size and the bath was amazing. The only slight problem was that it was 45 degrees and the air con wasn't very powerful - we managed ok with the use of a cold bath and had no trouble sleeping at night. Unfortunately it was too windy to use the roof terrace for meals but the courtyard was beautiful. The breakfasts were lovely and they catered for whatever we fancied.

72 Riad Living,BeckyP742 wrote a review Jul 2012,50,"A warm welcome with friendly, courteous and helpful staff",I recently stayed in the Riad 72. I'd read some previous reviews and they were very positive. So I was hopeful but that's the thing about a review each individual will always have a different experience. I wondered whether mine would be as good. I need not have worried. From the friendly driver who picked us up from the airport to the lovely Asiz who met us to wheel our luggage and escort us through the streets to the Riad right through the stay and at every juncture; we were met with smiles and interest wonderful service helpful and willing staff and all of our needs were accommodated.  On arrival we took a seat in the courtyard. Open roofed and with fully grown banana trees it was peaceful and beautiful. A stream of running water leading to small fountain added to the relaxing atmosphere. We were bought mint tea and freshly baked biscuits and as our room wasn't quite ready we asked if we could take to the roof terrace to sit out in the sun and this was not a problem. The plunge pool was being freshly filled with cold water and there is a cold water shower up there too along with a shaded gazebo with comfy low sofas and tables in case you fancy lunch and the view.  The room had been prepared for a couple and when we advised the staff we were friends only it was no trouble at all the rooms were re arranged immediately to accommodate two separate beds on two levels.The bathroom was beautiful and even had a door which led out onto the staircase to take you up to the terrace. There were many original details throughout the Riad with the double height doors and other wooden fret work fabulously maintained. We had a hammam there which delivered me back to room as soft and clean as a new born baby. And was given by Aicha a truly lovely lady. The food we had throughout our stay was delicious!! Breakfast was varied freshly cooked and baked and different every day. Plus it always included as much freshly squeezed orange juice as you wanted. I'm a vegetarian which is not usual in Morrocco and yet Fatima the chef happily made us individually spiced and creative dishes that were divine.  We were assisted in anything we chose to ask for help with. Including booking restaurants being picked up on one occasion after the meal and escorted back through the medina as it was quite late. We were given advice on where to go in the Medina for different things Jalil even accompanied us on one occasion translating and assisting in shopping. So much kindness and hospitality were extended to us with such warmth and sincerity that we were just blown away. A truly wonderful place to stay a real safe haven from the hustle and bustle and chaos just a few steps from the front door. I will definitely return. No question. A blissful stay in a fantastic place.,Date of stay: July 2012,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BeckyP742
72 Riad Living,Tracey K wrote a review Jul 2012,50,A wonderful stay!,I have just come back from 3 nights in Marrakech with my friend. We were picked up at the airport and driven back to the Riad. I was looking out of the window and crossing my fingers that my hotel was going to be lovely. There was so much poverty around me and everything was so different. I really wanted a peaceful surrounding for my short holiday. Well I need not have worried! We were greeted so warmly. We were offered mint tea and biscuits while our rooms were sorted out. We went up to our room and it had everything you could hope for. It was so clean and very traditional. The courtyard was peaceful and it was lovely to sit there and have a drink and watch birds fly in and out. We ate in for the first night and Fatoumah cooked for us. We are vegetarian so I know it was unusual for her but she cooked us a delicious feast! The breakfasts she made were out of this world. I always waddled away from the table very satisfied. Then Aicha took me under her wing and gave me my first ever hammam. Wow! It was such an amazing experience. I was scrubbed and cleaned and then a wonderful mud mask. I have NEVER been so clean and soft. It was incredible. The service was like nothing I have ever had before. Nothing was too much trouble. I was able to eat when I wanted where I wanted they just wanted us to have a nice holiday. Jalal (I am not sure of the spelling) who was one of the waiters there helped us very much. He helped us with all the shopping where to go what spices to buy and translated everything for us. We were taken to restaurants and picked up afterwards in case we got lost. This is such a lovely place to stay and the staff are very very nice. I really recommend this place to stay for tranquility and very helpful staff.

We were met at the airport and driven as close as possible we were then met by a member of staff and walked to the riad. They had prepared breakfast for us in the courtyard and from the word go we were treated so so well. The most relaxing atmosphere.    All the staff were brilliant and nothing is too much trouble. Rashid in particular made our stay extra special. Briliant guy.    We ate out a lot and one night had Fatouma's cooking at the riad. We ate on the roof as the sun was setting. I can honestly say that it was the best food we had over the course of the week and so we ate there again on our last evening. Some of the best food I've ever tasted in fact.

72 Riad Living,Chinbin wrote a review Jun 2012,50,A beautiful quiet Oasis,We stayed at Riad 72 for a relaxing weekend break. The Riad included one transfer to or from the airport and we were met at the airport by a driver who took us into Marrakech and dropped us with a porter from the hotel who showed us the way to the Riad. The Riad is not hard to find - once you know where it is but you'd struggle to find it yourself first time so I would recommend taking up the option from the Riad of being met from the airport.    The Riad itself is beautiful. The central courtyard has large trees growing within it with colourful small birds that tweet from within their branches and return at night to roost there and water quietly flowing within the courtyard it really is a beautiful quiet oasis.    One of the main reasons we choose this Riad was that it had a wonderful rooftop terraced seating area and the Riad is one of the tallest in Marrahech. We spent a lovely time on the rooftop terrace relaxing and reading with views over the city and of the Atlas Mountains in the distance.    The staff at Riad 72 are simply wonderful they were attentive and knowledgable but left you alone to relax and enjoy your stay. An example of the service at the Riad is that whilst we were on the terrace relaxing they brought up to us tea and biscuits without making a request for them.    We had read the reviews of the in-house cook: Fatouma and we were looking forward to her food having arranged for her to cook for us one evening. We had eaten out the night before and Fatouma's cooking was at least on par to anything we had eaten out. Her starter was stunning but the rest of the meal was good but not up to that standard I would recommend having Fatouma cook for you one evening.    The Riad is approximately 15mins walk to the main square and the Riad's location means you are close enough to anything in the Medina.    I loved staying here - it was wonderful. The room was comfortable and the bathroom was large and accomodating. There are only four rooms in the Riad so for you can easily feel that you are the only one staying there and the attentive staff make you feel very welcome indeed and can't do enough for you to make your stay as relaxed and perfect as possible.    Stay here - you won't regret it.,Date of stay: March 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chinbin

However nothing that we sampled came close to Fatima's cooking: her artichoke and lamb tagine was undoubtedly the best dish that we ate in Morocco.

The Riad 72 proved to be one of the highlights of our 4 days. The tranquility along with the excellent position in the town gave us the opportunity to mix the excitement of the Souk with the historical and cultural sites and allow us to retreat whenever we wanted.  Fathuma's home cooking was the equal of the most expensive restaurants we tried (Dar Zellig and Le Foundouk) and spending an evening with Rashid looking after you with the greatest attention to detail made staying in for dinner a joy.  We stayed in the Karma suite and took every advantage of having our breakfast on the terrace where we were also well looked after by a young lady whose name escapes us.

We also had easy access to the roof terrace which is a real highlight - as the riad only has 4 rooms it was never busy and watching the sun set every night in the comfortable seating area with a drink in hand will be one of our fondest memories. We ate at the riad on the first night and found Fatima's cooking and the intimate atmosphere just perfect. On the following 2 nights Rashid subtly persuaded us to cancel reservations we had made based on our review of the guidebook and we had 2 wonderful meals as a result - he knows his stuff!

A traditional riad with a touch of some international interior design pieces mixed with Moroccan average quality crafts it's a good setting for guests looking for some sort of exotic place to stay in the Medina area.  In my opinion the true value of Riad 72 it's his team of friendly Moroccan members leaded by Emanuella an Italian expat.

72 Riad Living,sinphoto wrote a review Jan 2012,50,A truly fabulous Riad!,Set in the heart of Marrakech this Riad is probably one of the best! From stepping off the aircraft the staff at Riad 72 were there to help and assist. Driven to the Riad and navigated through the hussle and bussle of this fantastic city the staff here arranged everything.    Greeted by Rashid with green tea and home made butter biscuits we were soon shown around this most impressive building. From the beautiful interior garden and grand living area to the most magnificent roof terrace with spectacular views of the Atlas Mountain ranges.    We were lucky enough to have the room with the mezzanine. Beautiful big bed and exquisite bed linen made for a very comfortable nights sleep. The house keeper was superb also with clean towels every day and bed linen changed on a regular basis. This room also has private access to the roof terrace from the bathroom although not warm enough for us to take some sun we still enjoyed watching the sun go down with a nice bottle of red on an evening.    We arranged dinner in advance on our first night and left this in the capable hands of Fatima who whipped up orange soup two tagines and poached pairs. Delicious! Would recommend eating in the Riad during your stay. Be sure to give your order at breakfast. We often left the decision up the Fatima as whatever she was cooking that day was fantastic. Try the Moroccan salads!!    As for breakfast we spent a good hour or so eating breakfast in the serene setting of the garden. Fatima cooking pancakes Moroccan (what I can only describe as crumpets) cakes in butter and honey and omelets all served with warm crusty breads and pastry's and of course Fatima's homemade preserves. What more can you ask for before a day in the city.    Rashid was most helpful during our stay. As this was our first visit to Marrakech it was wonderful to have him at hand in the evening. Guiding us through the map and pointing out the places to see and visit.    Fatima Rashid and all the other staff at this Riad were wonderful we can't thank them enough for making our stay so comfortable.

As a single female (blond) traveller I was quite nervous about being there on my own (having read the 2 page advisory in Lonely Planet) and I was completely taken care of by Emanuella and her team. They arranged airport transfers for me which were great very friendly and on time and when the transfer reached the central part of the medina where the Riad is located one of the staff from the Riad came to the main road and met me and then transferred me by foot to the Riad. He was very friendly spoke English well so I felt assured from the beginning. Entering the Riad for the first time was truely lovely an oasis - greeted with traditional handwashing mint tea and biscuits was fantstic after the early start from Gatwick. The accommoation was very comfortable quiet and private. They arranged private half day tours for me each morning and I also did 3 cooking classes with the wonderful Fatima who taught me 9 dishes in total --- all delicious and it was really fun. They also have a small private hammam which is fantastic - great staff and a very relaxing and pampering experience. I can't speak highly enough of the friendliness and helpfull of Emmanuella and her team and would highly recommend for any single or couple travellers.

The interior design of Riad 72 strikes a perfect balance between luxury and modesty nicely complimenting the generous but not subservient service. We enjoyed meeting the (world class) cook Fatouma and felt immediately at ease with the sweet and jolly staff. Emanuela the director bent over backwards to meet our unusual vacationer requests and has an abundance of local knowledge to share.

72 Riad Living,manninjj wrote a review Nov 2011,40,Nice little find and wonderful staff,We stayed in the Riad for 5 days and really liked it. The Riad is about an 8 minute walk away from the Souks and a 5 minute taxi ride away to wherever you want to go in Marrakech (the new town etc.) The Riad itself is very nice if not rather simple - the roof terrace is lovely for breakfast and dinner (they will usually accomodate if you ask to dine there unless the weather doesn't allow). The staff are absolutely wonderful incredibly sunny and welcoming - Rachid especially is fantastic. I was personally a little dissapointed by the food in Marrakech the restaurants (particularly the much talked about ones) are really not great for food although they are usually beautiful deco-wise; Fatima the chef remedied this with her chicken and lemon tajine orange soup Moroccan salads and especially her royal couscous! Of all the places we went out to eat - Dar Marjana (touted as one of the best where we dropped about 200 quid) Cafe Arab Mai Thai etc. - NONE of them came close food wise to Fatima's cooking. We didn't do the Hammam of the Riad as it is pretty small and there are so many traditional Hammams around the city. I did however get a manicure/pedicure and massage - for all of these treatments they call in local mobile therapists who you pay directly. For the ladies the mani/pedi therapist was really not great - no massage no base coat/no top coat just a lick of paint and the bill basically. The massage on the other hand was really fantastic after a 3 am start for our flight and an afternoon in the souks I was a ball of knots and the massage therapist really made all the difference - my partner also benefited from my diminished whining post massage so everybody was a winner.

The roof terrace is an oasis of calm. We arrived late and had arranged for a meal to be served in the courtyard which was delicious. Pillows need some personal tweaking and the local mosques will wake you at five o'clock call to prayer. But hey this is Morocco - buy ear plugs in the departure lounge.

72 Riad Living,np1900 wrote a review Aug 2011,50,A perfect first stay in Marrakech,Riad 72 collects you from the airport so taxi negotiations can be avoided for the very short ride to the Medina. As a first timer to Marrakech I wasn't sure exactly what was happening when your minibus pulls over and your bags are loaded into what appeared to be a customised wheelbarrow. But it's Morocco it's 30C in April and you just go with the flow. The very pleasant bell 'boy' accompanies you to 72 which is about 100m away down a couple of winding streets. Inside it's like stepping into another world; polished concrete smouldering incense swaying palms and a gurgling water feature. We were met by the enthusiastic and chatty Alexandra who sat down and explained everything that we wanted to know over a cup of mint tea. The room was the one that I've seen mentioned on this site before with the steep steps leading up to the bedroom and bathroom. It does take a bit of care but once you're up there it's all quite comfortable. With only four rooms it's deadly quiet and you can normally have the roof terrace all to yourself - perfect for a quick bottle of wine before heading out. The staff were always terribly obliging and any requests were fulfilled efficiently. If you can do try and have dinner there with the amazing cooking by Fatouma. I had a group of friends over for dinner on the terrace (including some French who live in Marrakech) and everyone conceded that it was the best meal that we'd all had in the four day stay - even the expats admitted that it was very good (they were no doubt miffed we had found it first!).,Date of stay: April 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/np1900
72 Riad Living,Captflash wrote a review Aug 2011,50,More like a family home.,We are a retired American couple who travel extensively. This is our first time in Morocco. We were met at the airport by Mohammed who took us as near the Riad as possible to the Dar el Bacha. We were met there by q man with a hand cart who took our luggage and walked us to the Riad about 200 meters. Once inside we were welcomed with mint tea and an explanation of Marrakesh and what we could expect. We were questioned about what we wanted to do and arrangements were made immediately to book dinner reservations to reserve the hammam and massage and to tour the souk and historic sites. Every wish was made real.    The service was impeccable. There are only rooms so one does pretty much what one wants when one wants. The guest makes the rules. The rooms are well decorated clean and comfortable. I can't think of a thing I would change. We were in Morocco in August and it was quite hot outside. The air conditioning was up to the task and we returned to the Riad midday to cool off and have a nap.

72 Riad Living,RnL_OnRoad wrote a review Apr 2011,50,Calm in the Storm,Knowledgeable people say that in Morocco there are two worlds. The street is for men and business and the home is for family. The aggression of the street in Marrakesh can be intimidating at times but enthralling nevertheless. When you visit you need somewhere that is “family” to return to and Riad 72 fits that bill. From the moment we walked in there was a friendliness and calm that allowed us to reenergize to explore the medina the gardens and the Atlas Mountains. The building is beautiful and the cooking is delightful but most of all the staff is wonderful.,Date of stay: April 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Menlo Park, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RnL_OnRoad

We had high expectations after reading all of the great reviews but the Riad exceeded them all - if you can stay here do it!  We were picked up from the airport and then met at the other end and led to the Riad. Once inside we were welcomed by Rachid (who was the perfect host all week!) with mint tea and biscuits and then shown our room. The interior is amazing beautiful banana trees relaxing music and beautiful decor. Our room was perfect with a huge bath and beautiful Morrocan doors and the view from the roof terrace is amazing. On clear days we could see the snow on the atlas mountains and being one of the highest terraces in the area meant you were never overlooked and could relax/sunbathe.

From the moment we arrived and saw the beautiful riad we knew we would have the most amazing time.    We were welcomed with mint tea and biscuits before being taken to our room. Our room was incredible. The interiors just amazing - perfect mix of Moroccan and Italian.    We had the most delicious dinner at Riad 72 on the first night (the best we had in Morocco) and the second night the staff made sure to reserve us a table at another great restaurant in Marrakech. The breakfasts were brilliant too – served in the stunning court yard - your own little piece of paradise. So lush and tranquil.    The roof top terrace was fantastic with stunning views over Marrakech. We watched the sun go down one evening and it was truly magical to hear the call for prayer right across the city.    The staff at Riad 72 were great – especially Rajid and Asif. Always smiling and happy to help you but at the same time very discreet.

It could not have been more fantastic. We were greeted at the airport by the Riad and loved walking through the little streets to the Riad. When the door opened all of us were jumping for joy. The atrium is beautiful and the rooms exceptional. We had a fantastic cookery lesson here and the staff took us to purchase the ingredients which was great fun. The staff here are fabulous and cannot be more helpful or attentive. The food is delicious. The roof terrace is stunning and the bed I slept in was enormous.

The worst experience: I decied to invite a friend to drink something in the terrace of the riad not in the room and all of a sudden came the guard in a rude way and shouting at me came and made me a big scandal telling me he will call the police for that and treated me as a criminal. First of all we were not informed about any policy or rule about of not been able to invited people in the public areas of the riad like restaurant or terrace i understand exactly rules but there are ways to communicate things even the manager told me was about the bad french of the guard  i thing was not the topic the excuse was so banal.

72 Riad Living,MrsSonners wrote a review Jan 2011,50,The perfect antidote to the hectic souks,This was the perfect place to stay as a group especially if as we did you have exclusive use of the Riad. The rooms were stylish and modern although if you like your privacy beware the bathroom doors are curtains. My room was on a mezzanine with some steep stairs but with a very nice seating area at the bottom. But if you have a problem with stairs you can access the bedroom through the bathroom. The other rooms were excellent especially the largest one with its huge double bed and fantastic bathroom.  The views from roof terrace were amazing and from one side you could see the Atlas mountains and from the other you face the souks and the old town.  The food was excellent and the staff were brilliant nothing was too much trouble it was a welcome retreat after a busy shopping trip.  The only (minor) downside is the very early call to prayer which you will hear all over the city and once you get used it even the lightest of sleepers will be able to ignore.,Date of stay: December 2010,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Harrogate, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrsSonners
72 Riad Living,racquellita wrote a review Jan 2011,50,Best Hotel Ever,My husband and I stayed at Riad 72 in early Dec 2010 and it was a wonderfully intimate and relaxing place to stay. A small riad with only 4 beautifully furnished rooms the staff at Riad 72 made sure that we felt like we were at home. The owners of Riad 72 have done a wonderful job and putting together a fantastically luxurious hotel but they have done something even more special - created a environment and service culture that makes their guests feel special. No request was too hard and every member of staff were unfailingly polite and always smiling. In particular Fatima their incredible chef was incredibly generous and gave me some of her recipes and invited me into her kitchen to show us how to cook our favourite dishes. All I can say is it was a very special experience and when I go back to Marrakesh I will definitely stay there again.

72 Riad Living,samandmitch wrote a review Jan 2011,50,"Superb hotel, wonderful staff, gay-friendly","This hotel was an absolute idyll. My male partner and I booked through Mr & Mrs Smith adding a note asking whether they would be comfortable with a gay couple staying. When by the eve of the trip we hadn't had a response we contacted Mr&Mrs Smith once more who whilst they couldn't get an answer from the Riad 72 said it shouldn't be a problem.    The opposite was true. We were made incredibly comfortable. Anything we wanted was provided - a small beautiful hammam with two young Moroccan students who gave us the full hammam wash and scrubdown; breakfast and dinner on the sun terrace; beers and olives in our room before dinner...    Our flight arrived three hours late due to the snow and we were trepidatious about the transfer. A man was there with a sign saying ""Riad 72"" - they'd checked and rearranged their schedule to make sure we were met. We were welcomed into the Riad [read the other descriptions on this site - they are true!] by the charming Rashid a young Morrocan man with a degree in Political Science and Alexandra who seemed to run the place in the absence of the Italian landlady. They literally couldn't have done more to make us feel at home. Alexandra is the perfect guide for protocol - frank and incredibly helpful especially for the first-time traveller to Morocco she's excellent.    We stayed in the Amal suite which has the biggest bath - perfect for trying out the black soap bought in the souk.    Fatouma is the chef - often she was just cooking for us - who prepares traditional Moroccan fare with a twist. Utterly delicious she'd decide what we'd have that evening and then we'd sit and wait for the delicious courses to be served. Terrific Moroccan wine and beer available - at a significant markup from the duty free but that's to be expected. We ate at two extremely high end restaurants - Fouquet's and Dar Moha - and neither compared to Fatouma's cooking not to mention the simple comfortable ambience of the riad.    We were discreet both inside and outside the riad but it was obvious that we were a gay couple and everyone made us feel totally at home.    If you stand on the sun terrace when the call to prayer begins you get this extraordinary sound of multiple calls to prayer from the various mosques in the city. Enchanting. Take your earplugs if you're easily woken - the call starts at 5am though the sound from within the riad was much much quieter.    I'm hesitant to recommend this too highly in case it's difficult for us to book next time!",Date of stay: December 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/samandmitch

The 4 rooms in this Riad are each unique with lovely moroccan features. The only negative was the bathrooms were traditionally designed and therefore have no door between the bedroom & bathroom (only a curtain).  The location was a very convenient 5min walk to the souks and a 10min walk to the main central square.  Whilst all the staff were excellent the highlight of this Riad was most definitely the food. Fatuma (the chef) has designed a traditional menu executed brilliantly. We also visited several different restaurants recommended by friends and guidebooks none of which compared to the Fatuma's cooking!!  The internal courtyard provided a serene setting for relaxing and eating meals.  As an extra touch this Riad has it's own Hammam room and will also organise massage treatments in your room.

72 Riad Living,bunnco wrote a review Oct 2010,50,Seriously - one of the best hotels there is. Peerless.,Let’s be clear. This is a good hotel. In fact it’s a very good hotel indeed. Actually one of the best. And it’s not often you can say that.    My wife and I wanted a week-long break whilst the kids went away for half-term with the school so we found the Riad72 on the Mr & Mrs Smith website. The description didn’t really do it justice so it was a bit pot-luck that we chose it.    It’s quite an exceptional place – just four luxury individually-designed rooms surrounding a lush Moroccan courtyard with an outstanding roof terrace “solarium” and a wonderful staff.    We emailed a few days before and they explained that a hotel transfer from the airport would be provided. Fifteen minutes after emerging from arrivals [allow one hour for passport control if you’re last off the plane] we were walking down an unremarkable side alley and through a rather unlikely front door which revealed the oasis within. It has a real ‘wow’ factor. It was perfectly situated within the Medina but not absolutely in the hub-bub of the Souk yet on-hand for all the attractions.    When we arrived at 9am although check-in wasn’t until later that day it wasn’t a problem and a full breakfast was provided – one of many splendid and tasty meals prepared by the in-house chef the charming Fatouma. The manager Alexandre explained about the various attractions and gave us a map that featured the other properties owned by the same Italian company [Riad Due & Riad12]. Later we went to the RiadDue which was just as nice but a bit more ‘funky’ – it has TV.    We spent the rest of the day until the room was ready on the Sun Terrace. This is billed as the tallest in the Medina and it’s not an idle boast. It can’t be overlooked and there are some supremely comfortable sun-beds [proper mattresses] a [very] little plunge pool outside shower and shaded sitting area. It couldn’t be better…. although there’s a periodic interruption from nearby Mosque’s competing for worshippers with a Call To Prayer. Some days we didn’t leave the Riad at all. Paradise.    We stayed in the Amal room one of the larger ones with an enormous comfortable bed tall ceilings and a bathroom with the largest marble bath imaginable. The nice thing about this room was that it had a little balcony sitting area overlooking the atrium where you can take tea. The decoration was beautifully sumptuous and very tasteful. The other rooms were either not as large having a shower instead of bath or didn’t have this platform.    The Riad has free high-speed wi-fi but no TVs. It’s perfectly peaceful – although we brought our Internet Radio to listen to the BBC in the room.    The food is exceptionally tasty and it’s cooked by the personably Fatouma – everything is made from scratch by her in the kitchen which you can see through the courtyard window. There’s a dedicated staff – about ten of them which for four rooms is amazing – but they were never intrusive and the very essence of understated professionalism. French is the main language but all speak broken English. There is a lovely French lady who speaks perfect English that visits every morning at breakfast to check everything’s okay or to assist with tours – another couple wanted to play golf and she sorted it for them.    The only downside was the fact that the Mosque Call-to-Prayer started at about 5am on some mornings - but if you can't stomach that you shouldn't really be in Marrakech.    As you can probably tell my wife and I were seriously impressed by the Riad72. If you go you won’t be disappointed.

From the communication we had with the Riad prior to our arrival about transfers from the airport and being met by the concierge who loaded our bags into a cart and escorted us to the riad from the taxi and preparing us dinner on our arrival (we had a night flight) we were thoroughly catered for and looked after.    Rashid was fantastic he took the time and went through a map of the main tourist attractions on our arrival whilst we drank mint tea (the best mint tea by far!!!) In the uber gorgeous courtyard area whilst listening to chill-out music on the riads ipod. Nothing was too much trouble.    We had breakfast at the Riad freshly prepared by Fatima gorgeous! Which we ate on the roof terrace. The chef was amazing by far the best tagine during our stay. Taxis were arranged for us and I had a massage in my room which was again by far the best I have ever had.

72 Riad Living,Sian1984 wrote a review Jul 2010,40,"An amazing place to stay, exceptional staff...but if other guests are inconsiderate it will really impact your stay",In terms of this Riad there is very little to fault it. It is stylish and elegant without being pretentious and the staff and service is impecible yet unobtrusive.    We stayed in the Amal suite that has the most amazing bathroom and a really decent size room although if I was returning with my partner I would definately splash out on the Lile bridal suite (which is just amazing!)    The roof top tarrace has a beautiful panoramic view of the city and the Atlas Mountains and the plunge pool although small is a really nice (and very welcomed) touch.    We ate here two nights on our stay and the food was really very good. In fact it was much better and far more reasonable than the places that we ate out on (all of which were supposed 'top notch' in terms of food and cooking). We ate on the room terrace which was relaxed and comfortable.    The only real downside to this riad is if the other guest are inconsiderate it really will impact on your stay. Our last night was totally ruined by the other to sets of guests coming back very late with non-guests playing music extremely loudly shouting and singing and generally being louts. Although a member of staff was on sight (non managerial) the problem was not nipped in the bud and I had to deal with this problem after nearly an hour of Lady Gaga and rattling about as they helped themselves to the kitchen. As all rooms overlook the courtyard there was no way to avoid being impacted by this noise and as we had to be up for a flight a 6.00 am we were less than impressed.    However this is as a result of very poorly mannered guests and is probably not a regular occurance.

Similarly the Riad is beautifully appointed blending modern Moroccan and Italian furnishings creating a quiet oasis from the busy Medina.

72 Riad Living,Daniel B wrote a review Feb 2010,50,"Relaxing, indulgent, faultless....",The trip from the airport drop off started the senses wondering if the right decision had been made on Riad 72 however once the dark wooden door opened and we entered the Riad it all became clear. A handwash and a glass (or two) of delightful mint tea set the tone for the relaxed informal yet attentive service and atmosphere we enjoyed during our three days. Our room Amal encouraged serious lounging whilst the roof terrace is beautifully set for long afternoons lazing in the sun and evenings spent under the stars enjoying a glass or two of good wine.  Nothing was too much trouble and a morning spent with Fatouma in the kitchen is an experience not to be missed! From arrival to departure the staff at Riad 72 went out of their way to provide assistance help and anything one could want - from ironing to restaurant bookings to setting up our room for dinner as a valentines day treat the service was impeccable.  If a spot of indulgence a dose of great service and a beautiful place to lay your head are high on the agenda give this place a chance you will not be disappointed. All in all a superb calming oasis in the heart of what can be a manic and at times testing city.,Date of stay: February 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,tetbury,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z747GNdanielb
72 Riad Living,DanUK wrote a review Jan 2010,50,Fantastic place to stay,"A truly wonderful find I'd echo the other recent reviews. Impossible to fault this property and whist the ""features"" of Souks and Medina may grate after a long day this place oozes total serenity.    With four rooms it's a huge property and you feel like you are alone. Staff only pop out when you need it otherwise it's all yours. We only ever saw other guests once in a three night stay - and only then in passing. The night porter Rashid was a gem - but they're all great. Take breakfast on the roof - just fantastic to start the day.    The decor is a wonderful mix of traditional Riad and Italian the old and the new. Very well appointed.    I would note that the staff don't really speak English so keep a little French to hand. Or wave your arms about - it's owned by Italians so that seems to work too! They are desperately friendly and keen to help with whatever you need (including a local beer - well needed after a day in the Souks and hard to find in the Medina!)",Date of stay: November 2009,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanUK
72 Riad Living,pmsystem wrote a review Nov 2009,50,Wonderful stay,"The Riad72 is located very close to the Medina. Is one of the nicest  hotels I ever seen. the furnishing is very very sofisticated the materials  are all naturals and the colours are so warm and unique.  Just few rooms are available ensuring quiet and no crowd. The staff  is very very friendly and anything you ask will be satisfied. ;)  In particular Rashid (if I remembed well the name) a new entry of the staff  was really nice with us.  One note for the ""new marry"" or ""new fiances"": The bathrooms have  no doors and is divided from the rest of the room just by a half-wall so  there is not a great ""privacy"". For me and my gf didnt make any problem  but maybe for the very new couples still ""knowing"" each other could  represent something embarassing.....",Date of stay: November 2009,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Italy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pmsystem

72 Riad Living,jth wrote a review Jun 2009,50,fabulous,"Cliche cliche: an oasis of calm! Delightful staff excellent food - though only sampled breakfast so far. Room clean fantastic bed huge bath - Amal room where bath is partly overhanging and encased in an intricate wooden structure. Would have no hesitation in staying here again. It is hard to locate initially but riad will arrange pickup (though they slightly messed this up with us - but local boy very helpful with locating it and escorting us from where petit taxi dropped / dumped us for 5 Dh!). Just get your bearings use the map and there should be no problem finding the riad again. Easy walking distance to most places in the medina. Ville nouvelle is walkable but a killer in the heat. Ask the taxis to drop you at Dar el Bacha - easy for them to locate and less than 4 mins walk to the riad.  Such a treat to return here after the heat hustle and bustle of the city.  Superb freshly cooked / baked breakfast. No rush in the mornings - starts 08:30 - till whenever you appear! ""bien domir?"" - most definitely with a leisurely 10:30 breakfast - a great start to the day.  Hotel provide a very useful map but you can pick up ""Marakech evasion"" map in the newsagent at railway station - also v useful with locations of restaurants sights etc  Enjoyed kefta sandwich at Cafe des epices also at Hassan's stand in the main square.

Service was outstanding we never had to worry about anything.    The riad/hotel is beautifully restored and has four rooms each of them has a completely different design. There is a nice inner courtyard with a fountain and many plants - a perfect place to enjoy the delicious meals of the house chiefs.    The rooftop terrace offers a splendid view over the city of Marrakesh and all the way to the Atlas mountains. There is a small pool on the roof as well but it is very small and if you arrive expecting a large pool you will be disappointed - but the pool is perfect to cool off after a long day in the souk.

72 Riad Living,ODM27 wrote a review Jan 2009,50,A really special place,We have travelled extensively for many years and have stayed in some of the world's most prestigious hotels but our recent stay at Riad 72 was truly unique.  Beyond the spectacular elegant and meticulously maintained physical structurewhich cannot be accurately depicted by photographs it is the professional and dedicated attiude of every member of the riad's staff and the amazing service that made our stay so special.  We were lucky enough to stay in the gorgeous Karma suite and really enjoyed the delicious freshly baked pastries every morning.  Every afternoon mint tea and biscotti were offered.  The riad's location is excellent right in the center of the Dar el Basha .This made sightseeing and walking to the Djamma el Fna and many excellent restaurants for dinner very easy. It is just outside the souks but much quieter and felt more safe.  Riad 72's staff made every effort to make our stay wonderful. They made restaurant recommendations and reservations that we loved arranged for a day trip made sightseeing suggestions kept the room immaculate at all times served meals and saw us off at 4 A.M. all with a smile and a genuine desire to please.

The rooms surround a large courtyard with banana trees. The courtyard has several sitting areas for relaxing over a mint tea or for an excellent meal prepared by the Riad's chef (like other travelers I would recommend at least one dinner in the Riad). We chose to have breakfast each morning on the roof-top terrace which has amazing views of the medina. The location is only minutes away from the Koutoubia Mosque and the Djemma El Fna. What made the stay superior was the staff. Everyone was extremely friendly gracious and eager to please.

72 Riad Living,gsbdiver wrote a review Apr 2007,50,A grand hotel in Marrakech,"This was a fantastic and elegant hotel. The food was excellent and the space outstanding. We had the suite just at the top of the entry stairs and it was outstanding -- lots of open space and as nice a hotel room as I have seen.    The service was excellent the view from the room outstanding and the touches in every corner of the hotel elegant and modern.    It is pretty hard to find and the locals of course are no help but once we got close we were able to find it and get help with our bags (service was great). I say that the locals were no help ""of course"" because asking a local for directions to hotel is almost certain to get you the standard reply of ""that hotel is closed/not any good/never heard of it...but my cousin/uncle/brother/father/son has a very fine hotel....follow me"". The hotel is not closed and it is grand so keep looking!

72 Riad Living,A Tripadvisor Member wrote a review Apr 2007,50,No nonsense review,My wife and I stayed here for 6 nights in the cavernous Karma suite  followed by 4 nights at Kasbah Tamadot then another 2 nights in 72 (suite again). I`m a fan of minimalist design and booked this riad because of it`s style and the fact it only had 4 rooms (more European/Japanese than Moroccan i hasten to add). The location is excellent for both through the awful Jeema-El-Fna square and the upmarket Gueliz area. A beautiful Riad with the most charming staff I`ve ever encountered we had a wonderful stay here. Mustapha who runs the Riad is knowledgeable helpful and happy to sit down for a chat ( when the phone is not glued to his ear! It`s a busy place). Brahim (a qualified lawyer!) is the most charming person I`ve ever come across with a deilightfully ever present smile  nothing being too much trouble for him- I enjoyed chewing the fat with him at the end of the night. Fatouma`s cooking could potentially be a solution to world peace (I may send her recipes to the UN) and she catered for my wife`s dietary needs perfectly. In fact her tagines were better than those I had at La Foundouk and Le Comptoir. Assiz couldn`t have asked how I was any more often if he tried and the 2 young women who worked there floated effortlessly and efficiently around this oasis.    Our room was truly vast with a stunning 25 foot high carved wooden ceiling and cupola and lovely tadelact bathroom that would have made John Pawson proud (although the bath could have been a few feet longer). The curtain to the bathroom however is not suitable for the shy person though and certainly would not have fitted in with the main tenet of the Bauhaus especially in the aural sense. It must have been worse in the smaller rooms. In my eyes a pointless peace of design for design`s sake. Doors work better people. The terrace is one of the highest in the medina and holds great views once you`ve mastered the tricky steps up and not whacked your head on the little entrance to it. A few health and safety tips wouldn`t go amiss like handrails and a mind your head sign. Dont book if it`s a pool your after- it`s pretty much a big bath on the terrace. There is also a small hammam where you cn have your skin removed from your muscles!!    I loved the serenity of the courtyard the little water feature and huge banana plant and we both made ourselves so much at home that we felt part of the furniture ( so much so that I`d raid the fridge at night when everyone had gone leaving a note as to how much beer I`d scoffed- I`m an honest soul).    The main drawback for us which would affect our return and I presume would be the same for every riad in the medina- the call to prayer at 4 am. It`s a part of Islamic culture and I`ve no right to complain but it drove me nuts. It was loud as hell and woke us up every day.    Although this riad is tucked in the backstreets of Dar El Bacha we were never troubled by anybody even at 3 am. In fact if and when you do become hopelessly lost in the world`s biggest rabbit warren people especially kids will offer to take you back for a tip- well worth it.    All in all a great place to stay with great staff. There are plenty of riads to choose from so check them all out and if we went back I`d certainly try others to compare such as Farnatchi or El Fenn but this one should be near the top of your list.,Date of stay: April 2007,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,edinburgh,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/null

My visit was last Nov-- I was provided transport form the airport and arrived at the Riad only to be greeted by Brahim (who speaks excellent English) and a wonderful meal by Fatima (the master of the kitchen.) My room was extremely roomy and very comfortable. The decor is incredibly serene and ""zen"" like-- a welcome change after traversing the many alley ways of the medina. Brahim was able to arrange for a guide as well as assist w/other conveniences. The following morning I had a hearty breakfast on the terrace.    The Riad is not centrally located but this could be a bit of an advantage if you like walking and observing street life. I made reservations by contacting the Riad directly and they were very responsive to my requests. Please note that this Riad has only 3 rooms and a suite; however it is very spacious.    The Riad is very well maintained extremely clean and has a wonderful staff. It even has a small hamman (by appointment.)

We booked the Amal Suite and really recommend this as a place to stay. The staff at the Riad were incredibly attentive and did everything they could to make our stay a success.    Like one of the other reviewers I was not too keen on the souks and attitude I got from some of the native Morrocan men and so it was a delight to return to the Riad for some peace and calm.    We had 3 excellent breakfasts (included) and only on Sunday was the breakfast a bit basic. We also had dinner in the Riad once which was nice but nothing special. We ate out one evening in the square and once at the Maison de Arabe. The dinner at the Maison de Arabe was very expensive and whilst my food was nice my partner suffered from horrendous food poisoning following this meal. We also thought that the restaurant was lacking in any atmosphere and seemed very ""corporate"" in style.    The roof terrace is a lovely place to have breakfast (depending on the weather) and also to spend some time if the weather is good. There is a small plunge pool there but it's only about 4 feet x 3 feet so it really is just a space for a dip.    There are guests of different nationalities staying there during our trip and given the Riad is so small (only 4 rooms) the whole place is very friendly.

My first glimpse of Marrakech came in the evening hours at Riad 72 and what a welcome glimpse it was. I came into the lobby so tired after four flights beginning in Austin Texas and Brahim had me sit and relax next to the fountains while he brought me tea. I was hungry and luckily another couple was eating in that night so I was able to get the same meal as they. It was so delicious a tangine and a bowl of the best soup I have ever eaten. My room was on the second floor and a little bit odd in arrangement. You enter into a small sitting area and have to climb a slightly rickety stairway to get up to the sleeping loft and bathroom. If mobility is an issue at all for you dont stay here or in a riad period! Anyway the staff headed by Raja was very accomodating and every request was answered with a ""no problem"". I am ambivalent about Marrakech or at least the Medina it is fascinating but very tiring and I can not imagine staying there for an entire week. One piece of advice whenever possible get small denominations of bills and coins.You have to tip everyone in this city from bellboys to direction givers and street performers and children and I never had anything smaller than a 100 dirham ($11).
