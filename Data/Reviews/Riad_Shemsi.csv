Riad Shemsi,homa644 wrote a review Dec 2022,40,A lovely break in Marrakech,We really enjoyed our four night stay at Riad Shemsi. Our room was the turquoise one which was beautiful (if a little dark for reading.) The bed was really comfortable. All the staff were brilliant so friendly welcoming and helpful. I also did a morning's cookery lesson which I really enjoyed too. Breakfasts were delicious with fruit yoghurt and different pastries and pancakes which set us up for the day very well. Sadly it was a little chilly for a dip in the pool which was a pity  though as we left I believe they were installing some heating.,Date of stay: December 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Winchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/homa644

Riad Shemsi,RossandAndreia wrote a review Feb 2020,50,What a fantastic Riad!,We loved everything about Riad Shemsi but what made this place stand out for us was the warmth of its people. Often you go places and people are nice because they have a reason to be. The staff working at Riad Shemsi are kind hearted people that don't need a reason to open their hearts to you. Being greeted by Abdul when we arrived we were offered a pot of Morrocan Tea and Cookies. From then on we felt at home. The next day we had the pleasure of meeting Noura and two other lovely ladies working at the Riad (sorry we never found out their names). Noura is the manager she's very nice and kind and she was happy to give us top tips on our adventures exploring Marrakech and Morroco. Abdul and the two Ladies served us a really delicious breakfast everymorning arriving with something subtly different to the previous. For all of the staff at Riad Shemsi we can say nothing was too much trouble. Whether you're new to Morroco or returning we recommend Riad Shemsi to anyone who whishes to feel at home with such a welcoming bunch of people.    My husband braved the pool for a grand total of 5 minutes during our stay (a little chilly in February) but you can still soak in the sun on the rooftop terrace above.    The location of the Riad is ideally suited for anyone wishing to explore Marrakech. Its about a 10 to 15 minute walk to Souks and the main square (Jama El F'na square).    We will miss everyone at Riad Shemsi and we're looking forward to our next visit!!!,Date of stay: February 2020,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RossandAndreia
Riad Shemsi,Isabel D wrote a review Dec 2019,50,Magical Riad,I highly recommend this Riad: such a beautiful place!! Breathtaking!  Everything is perfect to the detail. Nice terrase beautiful pool and perfect rooms.  I highly recommend to book a dinner in the hotel as they buy everything fresh from the market and in our case they set up a romantic table next to the pool with candles.

Riad Shemsi,Helen G wrote a review May 2019,40,Nice quiet riad,Cute quiet small hotel. Breakfast was good and pool area was nice. Its a bit far from the main area with all the restaurants requiring a 15-20 minute walk in the evening. Great location for visiting tombs and palaces and not within the intensely touristy areas.    Our room whilst very pretty was quite dark.

Riad Shemsi,Michael R wrote a review Mar 2019,40,Great stay,We spend four days in the Riad in February 2019.  The Riad is situated in the old part of the town and is very quiet despite the location. The Riad is beautiful and in a good state. The roof terrace is also very nice.  The service was perfect - only smiling and friendly people working in the Riad.  The only reason for not given the Riad five stars - was that the pool to cold to be of any use.,Date of stay: February 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Augustenborg, Denmark",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A6716WTmichaelr

Riad Shemsi,JamieHarker wrote a review Oct 2018,50,Peaceful Haven,We stayed at Riad Shemsi for a relaxing break after our daughter’s wedding. Sadly we missed our outward flight from Gatwick due to M25 roadworks and lack of diversion signage so we arrived a day late!! Thereafter Noura and Abdul could not have been more helpful despite ropey weather (no fault of their’s). This is a wonderful oasis from the manic world of the Medina and I cannot recommend it more highly.,Date of stay: October 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Whitchurch, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JamieHarker
Riad Shemsi,Pineplain wrote a review Oct 2018,50,Wonderful home away from home,We had a wonderful week at Road Shemsi. As a group of friends we occupied the majority of the 6 rooms. I stayed in the orange room and would recommend it and the Turquoise and Chocolate (if you can handle stairs) as the largest. The others were a little tighter. The breakfast was lovely and we had dinner at the Riad one night which was lots of fun. Turned up and music and danced away. The kitchen was happy to chill wine and beer for us as well. The rooms are a little dark if you like bright lights and you need to enter via a winding alley - so not good for heels!,Date of stay: October 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pineplain
Riad Shemsi,kingdomDublin wrote a review Aug 2018,50,A Great Place to Stay,Loved this Riad located close to the Palace inside the Medina. The staff including Abdul Nadya and Zacaria made you feel so welcome - spotless rooms pool and common area with the most delicious breakfast including a vanilla yogurt made by Nadya herself. Easy walking distance to all the sites and a 5 minute walk from a great harman - Hamman a L'Alahbra which i would highly recommend.

Riad Shemsi,Amelia B wrote a review Jul 2018,50,Fantastic,Thoroughly enjoyed my stay! Perfect location it was peaceful and quiet and a 10 minute walk to the bustling Jemaa el-Fna square. The staff were very welcoming and accommodating (e.g moving breakfast earlier so we could be ready for our day trip on time). The included breakfast was amazing a mixture of traditional Moroccan pancakes and familiar croisants and varied slightly everyday keeping it interesting. The fruit was fresh as well as the orange juice. The room was clean and comfortable and the decoration all over the road was beautiful. I spent most of my evenings either on the roof top terrace with a 360 view of the town or one floor down in the sheltered area with comfortable seating (see picture). Adbdul was extremely helpful in recommending places to eat booking taxis e.t.c. We will definitely return to Riad Shemsi if we visit Morrocco again!!,Date of stay: July 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ameliab846

All the staff was always available and helpful. They helped us for the excursions and they looked after us. The riad is peaceful and close to the main attractions.

Riad Shemsi,Pyecombe wrote a review Mar 2018,40,"Nice people, Nice Location, Nice Price",It's impossible to fault the staff or the welcome. MInt tea is always on tap and they cannot do enough for you.  It's located on the outer reaches of the Medina and accessible to a number of great eateries and fine dining.  The food in the Riad is also of a good quality.  The rooms (we stayed in Vanille) though leave a bit to be desired as the walls are paper thin and the plumbing resembles a waterfall when another guest flushes their toilet or has a shower.  The roof top terrace is a great feature with stunning views.  I would not recommend this for light sleepers but its comfortable and the service makes up for the deficiencies in the accommodation.,Date of stay: March 2018,,"Eastbourne, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pyecombe

Riad Shemsi,RobboElviria wrote a review May 2017,40,Tranquility in a city of madness,At the end of an alley about 1km from the main attractions this is indeed a tranquil place to relax after experiencing the madness of Marrakesh.    We spent two nights here and could not fault the service we received. The staff were keen to help recommend and advise nothing was too much trouble to ensure that we enjoyed our stay.    In all honesty a certain amount of refurbishment would have been welcomed but that said our room was comfortable clean and cosy.    Breakfast was a simple affair of breads and preserves yoghurt orange juice and coffee just what was required to set you up for the day.    The pool was a welcome refuge after returning from a day amid the hustle bustle and heat outside.    With just six rooms a very intimate type of service is provided.    Certainly worth considering if you are visiting.,Date of stay: May 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobboElviria

Riad Shemsi,forgetmenotxoxo wrote a review Jan 2017,50,Fantastic place to stay in traditional Marrakech,We just loved this little oasis in the middle of old town Marrakech it took a bit of navigation on the first day to find our way around but that was a) just what happens when you are in Marrakesh and B) all part of the fun!!  Marrakech can be a pretty daunting place to arrive in no matter what planning you have done however the warm welcome you will receive and enjoy throughout your stay at Riad Shemsi will put you totally at ease.  Located down one of the many allleys of the old town we did not know what to expect however when the door was opened by such friendly and accommodating staff and the outstanding surroundings we got to enjoy we were delighted!  We felt we could have asked for anything and it would have been provided but there was no need it was all there a beautiful room delicious breakfast a roof terrace... all so tastefully done.  Apart from that the staff were more than accommodating in recommending places to go/see/eat and ordering taxis when required.  If you want to experience the craziness of traditional old town Marrakech with a relaxing place to stay this is it.  Only 10 min walk from the main Souks too!!,Date of stay: June 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Bangor, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/forgetmenotxoxo

Riad Shemsi,Amy H wrote a review Nov 2016,50,"Tranquil, cozy place to stay",I booked this riad for its location: still in the Medina but close to the new city and in particular the conference venue of COP 22 a big climate conference. It was a 20-minute walk and although Riad Shemsi is located at the end of one of the Medina's windy maze pathways one of the women working at the riad walked me out the first day to ensure I could find my way. The food -- both breakfast and the dinner I had twice -- were quite good though quite a lot too so make sure you're hungry whenever you have a meal there. Breakfast is included & dinner is extra (25 Euros). The staff was very helpful and friendly. There's a beautiful roofdeck too. A few minor suggestions for future guests -- only one man Abdul spoke English very well so be prepared not to speak much English to the women working there. The breakfast is quite bread-heavy. I would have liked a bit more fruit every day and/or something else not bread. the room I stayed in -- the turquoise one -- was lovely though very little light in the shower area and hot water didn't last very long. Overall fantastic experience that I highly recommend.,Date of stay: November 2016,Trip type: Traveled on business,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P1945BJamyh

Riad Shemsi,ceseria wrote a review Oct 2016,40,Calm in the middle of a crazy city!,Further to our 3 night stay in the Widiane Suits and hotel as part of a holiday booked through secret escapes we were transferred to the Roah Shemsi in the heart of Marrakesh. Upon arrival we walked through a shabby looking door to be met with an oasis of calm. We were given some mint tea and local pastries before being shown to our room which was lovely on the first floor. The hotel also has a pool (weather not warm enough to use) and a lovely roof terrace which overlooks the city. The riad is located in the kasbarh area and a short (but crazy) walk to the main square. It is very close to a lot of the main attractions without being too close to the craziness that Marrakesh offers. We always felt safe around the hotel even at night and there are some lovely restaurants within a short walk including the Clock cafe and the Kasbah Cafe which over looked the Tomb and a great sport to people watch after a long tiring day. I was disappointed with breakfast which was just some Moroccan pancakes yogurt and bread and would have liked some eggs as there is only so much bread you can eat. We asked about having a meal at the Riah one evening as it gives the option on their website and information booklet in the room but were told they didn’t offer this!! Overall a lovely place to stay and escape the intense hustle and bustle of the city.,Date of stay: October 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,England,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ceseria

Riad Shemsi,mgfreak wrote a review Oct 2016,50,"Super helpful people, and great location",This was a 2 night stay following 5 nights in the High Atlas at a very remote resort - suffice to say Shemsi couldn't be more of a contrast to where we came from.  We arrived mid afternoon and the driver stopped in a tiny side street and called Shemsi for someone to come e and fetch us - we waited 5 minutes and a lovely lady appeared and guided us pulling one of our cases (we took the other) through narrower and narrower streets and eventually to a door at then end of an alley.  In we went straight into a beautiful open courtyard decorated in dove greys and white with a small plunge pool in the centre and rooms on 3 sides with an interconnecting wall to a neighbouring property on the fourth side. The first thing that struck me was the smell Shemsi smells lovely - all the time - they do their own laundry on the 3rd floor and it constantly smells of fresh linen - this can be a welcome relief in Marrakech!  We were shown to our room on the ground floor - I have to be honest it was initially somewhat disappointing after the resort we had travelled from as it was small dark and with a bed as hard as a board! We now know there are much nicer rooms in the Riad (6 rooms in total we had the least nice) as we asked to see them all before we left - all the other rooms are better that the one we stayed in but in fact this mattered not we really only showered and slept (if a little fitfully because of the mattress) in the room anyway but there was literally no room to unpack very little wardrobe space and so we lived out of our cases for the 2 days we were there - made getting ready for the journey home easier anyway!  Breakfast at the Riad is homemade yoghurt - delicious homemade Bread pronounced delicious by my friend but as a Coeliac I can only comment on the sight and smell - looked and sniffed extremely well - with a Dairy Lea cheese triangle I mention this as it made me smile on both days!  The Riad itself is perfectly placed just a few minutes walk from the main square in Marrakech with all the hustle and bustle that this delivers. A great place to stay to explore the wider city on foot in a cab or via Caleche (Horse drawn Carriage) - we did all three. We asked the people at Shemsi to arrange a guide for a half dayand Mohammed arrived promptly the next morning at 10am. We covered the Majorelle Gardens the Souks the large Mosque and the Caleche tour during our 4 plus hours with Mohammed and in my opinion this was money extremely well spent. Mohamed was lovely super friendly extremely knowledgeable about Morocco in general and Marrakech in particular and adept at guiding us through the Souks to the particular areas we wanted to see. the highlight for me was a street food lunch - right in the middle of the Souk sardines and other fish fried in front of us served with sliced fried aubergine and chilli sauce - just amazing - simple delicious and something I have to admit I would never have found had the courage to order or the bravery to eat if Mohammed had not been with us.  What he did in fact was give us the courage to go back into the Souk the next day on our own and thoroughly immerse ourselves in the Marrakesh culture and experience - if you have been before you will know what I am talking about but as first time visitors and being 2 women it was all a bit crazy on first glance - its amazing how quickly it becomes the norm I have been back in the UK for 4 days and I want to go back to Marrakech straight away - I loved it!  We ate lunch and dinner out most of the time - a word of warning if you want any alcohol with your food you will pay at least five times as much for the food just to eat in a licenced restaurant - and the food is better in the cafes and open stalls in my opinion - so our solution was to have a cocktail in one of the rooftop bars overlooking the main square - then go to any of the cafes in the side streets for lunch/supper then back to a rooftop bar for a nightcap or alternatively take a taxi to a supermarket buy some wine and take it back to Shemsi (they do not have a licence and cannot provide you with alcohol).  This is worth doing as Shemsi have a super rooftop overlooking Marrakech and this is a lovely place so sit after a days sightseeing with a glass of wine watching the sun go down. call me a lush but it wasn't the same with a bottle of water so we remedied this for the second night!  On our departure day Shemsi cooked us a beautiful dinner just before we left for the airport again arranged by Mohammed. The food was delicious properly prepared with huge care and pride and was one of the best meals of our entire stay in Morocco - extremely good value for money also.  I would definitely visit Shemsi again I loved it loved the people who work there and love the location - my only advice to this brilliant Riad is to be more up front with how you can add to the experience of your guests - for example if Mohammed hadn't told us that they would cook for us on request we would never have known and I get the feeling they could add loads of value to guests that we were not able to become aware of in our short stay - don't be shy Shemsi - you are amazing and you should revel in this.,Date of stay: October 2016,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Barnstaple, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mgfreak

It really felt like they did everything to make sure our stay went well. We also got the airport transfer through them which worked very well.    The only thing that could be slightly improved was the breakfast. It was mainly just bread and pastries - which were really nice - however I was expecting a bit more.

We were the only guests there so had the courtyard and swimming area to ourselves.

We had a downstairs room overlooking the pool which was beautifully decorated and very comfortable – the bath robes were lovely to lounge around in! The bathroom had a large shower with a good hot water supply and nice fluffy towels were provided. We did spot a guest under the sink on our second day but were told by the staff that cockroaches are common in the old town – they cleaned the area and although we did see it again it didn’t bother us. We spent a couple of lazy afternoons on the wonderful terrace where there are loungers and sat and read under the covered cosy seating area. The pool was kept very clean and although we only swam once (a bit cold!) it was very refreshing. The riad is a 10-15 minute walk from Jemaa el-Fnaa square and a straightforward route. We enjoyed walking it several times a day but could have booked a taxi through the riad if we’d wanted to. Breakfasts were all homemade with lovely jams bread cakes and tea (mint is fantastic!). We particularly liked that there were no time restrictions so breakfast was served whenever we got up and there was no rush to finish. If you’re after peace – this place is perfect we slept very well only being woken on one occasion by the call to prayer at 6am.,Date of stay: January 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Swansea, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janey84
Riad Shemsi,katherine153 wrote a review Jan 2016,40,Peaceful oasis in this mad city,Just spent 4 nights in this lovely quaint old riad hidden away in the depths of the Kasbah. You really need a hotel transfer to get here - no way could you find it alone!! We had the 'orange room' on the first floor. This is the perfect size with all you could need although better lighting in the bathroom especially a light in the shower would be appreciated. All the staff we met - Noura Nadia and Abdul were lovely friendly and helpful people for whom nothing was too much trouble. Nice to get a beer here too as you can't in city restaurants and cafes. Breakfast was good though a little more variety or choice would have made it even better. Yoghurt was delicious! Evening meal was OK though a little overpriced compared with local restaurants and we only got 2 courses instead of the 3 which were advertised. The roof terrace was a delightful place to sit and relax read watch the sun go down and the storks fly in. My husband even dipped in the lovely little pool though it was very cold! We were lucky that the weather for January was much warmer than normal with no rain and sadly no snow on the Atlas mountains. This is the perfect place to retreat from the manic atmosphere of the rest of Marrakech but be warned - you will keep getting lost down all the alley-ways. Don't forget your map!! A great spot and highly recommended. Good price too.,Date of stay: January 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Lancaster, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/katherine153

The place had stunning decor and a lovely private roof terrace for sunbathing.  Great breakfast and lovely staff who go out of their way to help you.  Only negative is I found it a little confusing to find the medina but that may well be me!?

Riad Shemsi,ktrtontour wrote a review Jan 2016,50,Fabulous new years/birthday mini break,Just back from a truely relaxing break at the Shemsi. From pick up at the airport to departure this riad met and exceeded our expectations. As advised by others in previous reviews do book the riad to pick you up as it is located in a hard to find part of the Kasbah. Despite a two hour wait in passport control tbe driver was still waiting for us. On arrival we were given mint tea and shown our room. We stayed in the downstairs vanilla room beautifully decorated and really comfortable. Dressing gowns a lovely treat! The riad helped us out by booking a restaurant for new years eve that turned out to be excellent. Breakfast in riad was divine every day! The Shemsi is located at the top of Kasbah road about 15-20 minutes to the square on foot. The walk is a good way to experience marrakech! Good location too for walking to all sites. Roof terrace great place to relax in sun. Overall I was really impressed and would not hesitate to recommend this place!

The stay was so relaxing and quiet which was great and in stark contrast to the hustle and bustle of Marrakech place. The room was really well appointed with a truly Moroccan style.The bed was really comfortable and the shower was excellent.In contrast to a busy hotel this Riad had a personal feel with the staff really helpful and friendly. There was unlimited hot Mint tea and English tea served at no extra charge. The Riad served a lovely continental style breakfast with lovely bread cakes yogurt and preserves with lots of tea or coffee.There was a lovely rooftop area for suncatching and a swimming pool. Everywhere was so clean. There were shops and things to do close by with only a 15minute walk to the main square. We were very close to the Royal Palace. There is a good taxi service back to the hotel from any part of Marrakesh.

As it happened we were the only guests staying at the Riad that week! The staff were lovely and very helpful although communication in english was sometimes tricky! We booked a walking tour of the souks through the riad and he was worth every penny - he showed us around and told us a lot about the history of the city and dispersed any hesitations i had about wandering the souks alone! the riad is located about 10 mins walk form the main square in the Kasbah area which was very welcoming and safe.

Riad Shemsi,Gabriella P wrote a review Sep 2015,50,Fantastic stay in a wonderful city!,My boyfriend and I travelled to Marrakesh a few months ago. We booked this Riad because of the great reviews we read on TripAdvisor we were glad we did so in fact we had a wonderful stay! We stayed in the Berber suite (the pink one) and we loved it! It is a bit small so if you are staying for more than 4 nights I suggest you pay a bit more for a larger room. All rooms are cosy and comfortable anyway many other travellers were very pleased with their accommodation. Breakfast is delicious and it is cooked fresh every morning for you... what a luxury! The staff is wonderful everybody is very professional and kind! I suggest you contact them to book a transfer in and transfer out service to and from the airport it is worth the money and the driver is very good. We paid £15.00 per transfer if I remember correctly (make sure you double check) and we were comfortably picked up and driven in a lovely car. The owner of the Riad is very kind and polite unfortunately I can't remember his name but he is wonderful! We had an issue with the A/C in our room and he fixed it straight away but he offered to move us because of the inconvenience. We could have had a different room but we loved ours so much we stayed the problem was fixed for good. This is the best Riad and I cannot recommend it enough! If you book make sure you have Nadia's wonderful tajine before you leave it is DELICIOUS! She is a great cook!

Pool on ground floor and a beautiful air-conditioned suite.    Only thing I would mention was that it was a bit difficult to find but that is more than likely due to our atrocious taxi driver from the airport and our naive touristee ways.

Riad Shemsi,Lee R wrote a review May 2015,40,"Excellent, calming and very reasonably priced Riad","This beautiful riad although a 15 walk from the main square is absolutely fantastic. The rooms are lovely the small communal areas are well maintained and the 3 members of staff are unobtrusive but do everything you could ask of them. The area is interesting the main thoroughfare through the ""Kasbah"" as this area is called is interesting with some shops and restaurants. A taxi is 50MCD about £3 to go anywhere within the city. The breakfast is lovely fresh coffee yoghurt OJ and breads with jam and honey. The pool was nice although a little chilly at the end of May. Would recommend this delightful little Riad we actually had the place to ourselves for 3 days can't think why aren't staying here.

Riad Shemsi,GSF888 wrote a review May 2015,50,The best Riad by far...,I am sitting here now on our last day. On the ground floor next to the pool the smell of freshly cooking food and the most obliging people I have ever met. We are staying in the chocolate suite which is the best room because it's the largest. Top floor with a huge room and ensuite bathroom. The setting is tranquil and something you'd see in a postcard. We booked this through secret escapes and have not been disappointed.    There is a chill-out area on the second floor and a stunning tiled roof terrace with enough room for several people to sunbathe.    The location is in the medina the old city and within a 15 minute walk of the souk and open square where a hundred small businesses thrive between here and there. It's busy all day every day.    The riad arranges everything including experienced drivers to take you to where ever you want to go.    Just love it. You can't go wrong. Is even give this riad 20 stars if possible.,Date of stay: May 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GSF888

Riad Shemsi,Ian T wrote a review Dec 2014,50,An Oasis in the Storm,We stayed in the top floor Chocolate Suite. It is exactly as the pictures on the website so quiet and peaceful. We were greeted by the fantastic Abdul every evening who spoke great English and brought us mint tea and water to our room when ever we asked for it and didn't mind being woken when we could work out to turn the heater off. He served breakfast with a smile at what ever time we asked for it.The bed was firm but clean and fresh as were the towels and robes. We booked the transfer back to the airport that was 15 euros which was stress free and wish we had done the same on the way in which was far more stressful using local taxis ourselves.  The Clock Cafe next door does some of the best scrambled eggs I have ever had.  Follow the Rue Des La Kasbah to the main square but stop in the fixed price shop half way up on the left just before the Tombs (has a security guard and an escalator). This has every gift you ever want at a fixed hassle free price which is very reasonable (certainly cheaper than the airport!).

Riad Shemsi,Jo M wrote a review Nov 2014,50,"Delightful Riad - an excellent introduction to Marrakech, 15 mins from the busiest area",We stayed in the romantic Turquoise suite and loved our 4 night stay. The staff Noura Nadia and Hafid were absolutely charming and the home-cooked meal we ate there one evening (a beef tagine with prunes and apricots) was first class. The Riad makes a fantastic first impression - an oasis of calm accessed via a door at the end of a short walk-way just down from a busy street. The pool (cold - we had a quick dip) forms the centre-piece of the ground floor and the view up to the sky past archways and pillars is stunning. It's opulent yet homely and decorated in a way that feels really authentic. We loved the lighting in particular. The dining area was perfect - light and airy - and there's a roof terrace that we had entirely to ourselves complete with a view of the Atlas mountains and the surrounding mosques. I enjoyed the sound of all the calls to prayer starting up from the mosques in the city when I was on the roof although I hardly heard them inside.    The Turquoise suite was homely had decent storage space a safe hairdryer and free WiFi. There's a TV area outside the room. It was so quiet that we both slept incredibly well during our stay - something that continued to amaze us when we walked out into the bustle of the streets outside.    In terms of location Riad Shemsi could not have been better for us. It's a 20 minute drive from the airport a 15 minute walk to the central square and the souks and 10 minutes to the Royal Palace and the Saadian Tombs. Noura gave us a map and told us which way to walk. The Riad is near to the noise colour smells and life of the Kasbah but felt comfortably far away from the souks - like a training slope for the mayhem of the busiest areas! If you ate nowhere but the Clock restaurant literally just round the corner from the Riad (famous for its camel burgers) you could do a lot worse - you can also do an excellent full day cookery course there which we loved. Breakfasts in the hotel were simple but great. The mint tea was the best I had while in Marrakech and Hafid performed the ceremony of pouring it from a great height then pouring it back into the silver teapot and re-pouring. Made me smile every day. I asked if I could arrange a massage and was offered one two hours later on that same day! It was a decent massage from a lady who came in from another hotel - the room was a little cold but there was good use of towels and it did the job. We walked as far as the restaurant Dar Moha beyond the souks and got a horse and carriage taxi to Majorelle Botanical Gardens north west of the souks - well worth a look. Cafes in the main square with a terrace offer a fab view of all the hurly-burly below from snake charmer to acrobats.    Noura's English and French are excellent and the Nadia and Hafid's English is a whole lot better than our Arabic! We didn't expect people to converse with us in English and our French wasn't all that but we managed just fine and with good humour all round. The staff were really very nice people. We'd definitely return here.,Date of stay: November 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jo64adventures
Riad Shemsi,Bathplumber wrote a review Sep 2014,40,A haven in the Kasbah.,Riad Shemsi is a great place to stay very quiet & near to the Clock Cafe which is excellent.  There were times when it was difficult to converse but we did manage in the end. I do agree with Keith regarding the sockets hanging of the walls as I think we must have had the same room. The bathrooms were very small at least in the Berber & Vanille & the bath robes did hang over the toilet. Breakfast on the roof was excellent their home made natural yoghurt was lovely. Havid is a nice guy & made us all feel very welcome. Go stay there the walk from the Mosque up to the riad is full of little business's with lovely friendly people.

Riad Shemsi,brian d wrote a review Sep 2014,50,"Lovely Riad, run by lovely people :)",We stayed in one of suites next to the pool. The decor of the suite is kitted out in traditional Moroccan style which is exactly what we were after. The Riad is conveniently located in the Kasbah region and only 10-15min walk to the main square and souks it is also next door to the Clock cafe which is on Timeout's list of places to eat in Marrakech...so the location is ideal.  The service from the staff (Noura Nadia Khadija and Abdelhafid) was amazing and we felt so welcome and relaxed from the moment we arrived until we left with Noura's top organisational skills being a great help with any queries that we had. We did enquire about some of the not so great reviews that have appeared on trip advisor and Noura assured us that this was due to a guard that worked there previously and was no longer an issue Abdelhafid is their new guard and he was excellent in giving advice on places to visit and eat plus he prepared the breakfast perfectly on time everyday.  The other review having an issue with Nadia's English seems a tad harsh as we can't speak French yet we were able to book a driver for excursions book a breakfast time buy cosmetics and order some her excellent food without issue (totally recommend her lemon chicken tagine and aubergine starter by the was as she is very talented cook but need to order in the morning as she goes out and buys the ingredients during the day so it is fresh).  Noura organised our transfer with a driver called Tarik and he was excellent so much so that we booked him for our excursions to the Atlas Mountains and Essaouira. His driving was calm and not speeding or overtaking around blind bends and happy to stop for photos.  Another note about the riad it is surprisingly cool during the heat of the day and even when it is full it still feels fairly empty and private.    Overall we fully recommend staying at Riad Shemsi and can't to visit again.,Date of stay: August 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/471briand
Riad Shemsi,Fabresito wrote a review Aug 2014,50,Amazyng,It was a fantastic experience. First of all is about 15 mins of Djema el Fna Square a part of the medina not very loud and very quiet. Right next to the Royal Residence of Hassan II in Marrakech and 5 mins to the Saadian tombs. The 6 rooms are fantastic each one and go up in price as they are better. Ours was the Tourquoisse for about 110 € per night. The pool is available all day and at night with lights is decorated with a lot of French taste and has a great chill - out upstairs on the terrace where you can ask to serve both breakfast and a good fresh mint tea . the service is very good and especially Hafid the guy working at night and serves breakfast too. It has been a pleasure to have it and he has solved a lot of things besides making us great recommendations for dinner or visit. It has been a differential point during the trip.

Riad Shemsi,David Rudd wrote a review Aug 2014,50,Riad Shemsi - Kasbah Marrakesh,We chose the Riad based on all of the reports that we had seen.. and the night before we left having seen that every previous write-up was amazing we then spotted the 'huge disappointment' comment from Keith. Well we must say if there had been any issues then they have all been resolved!...we have travelled to many places and always sought out small boutique hotels or accommodation that give a friendly welcome and this Riad gave everything we were looking for. We arrived at the airport having booked the transfer (15 euros each way) and were welcomed by a friendly guy who transported us to the Riad. On arrival a mere 10/15 minutes from the airport we were welcomed by Noura who was absolutely perfect in making us feel welcomed. She took us through the places to go .. things to avoid (I shall expand in another post).. but this was to become a magical experience..  We booked the Chocolate Suite - on the upper level .. and we almost always had the terrace and roof garden area to ourselves. The Chocolate Suite is exactly as it shows - amazing.. value for money and exquisite in its own right .. if you like different from the run of the mill hotels then this is superb. The Kasbah Is a more non-touristy part of the city - about 15 to 20 minutes walk into the main square.. but a scenic if not different walk to get there... don't expect that you are walking along a beach.. everything that you may expect is around every corner.. but safe as safe can be.. daytime or night time...  All of the staff at the Riad (you may want call it a hotel but this is a very special place with just 6 rooms) were absolutely brilliant.. if you get involved they will give back to you.. Mohammed was just adorable.. we came back every day and asked for ice.. and it was there ready for us. Breakfast was as it said .. simple but homely.. and served with a smile every time.  Having been to many places - I can truly say for the both of us that this was possibly the best break we have ever experienced .. and we have been to many places in search of this kind of destination..    Marrakesh is a very different destination and the Riad deserves to be noted as one of those places that makes this a magical experience.  .,Date of stay: August 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Greater London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rudddavida
Riad Shemsi,Keith P wrote a review Aug 2014,20,Huge disappointment,We stayed here for two nights after three nights in the Atlas mountains as part of a package. In view of the recent reviews we were looking forward to our short stay but it turned out to be a huge disappointment. We were met by Nadia who spoke no English and was not able to supply any information such as a map or even accurate directions to the centre of Marrakech. She showed us our room which though nicely decorated was small with a tiny bathroom - the bath robes were hanging over the toilet. The room contained one dirty glass no hair dryer and a light switch and a socket were dangling by their wires.  Our package stated we would be upgraded to a superior room subject to availability and we came to realise that most rooms were vacant. My wife's French was not up to a conversation about upgrading.  Nadia said the owner Noura (who is mentioned in previous reviews) would be back at 5.00. but when we returned she was not there and as far as we are aware she never was there.  We were not informed when breakfast would be available so assumed it would be around 8.00 am. We came out of our room at 8.00 and realised there was no member of staff or owner on the premises. Nadia arrived at 9.10 and after asking breakfast was served. We had intended to make an early start so we could do some sightseeing before it got too hot.  We returned mid afternoon and had to request glasses water and hair dryer which would have been a problem had my wife not spoken French. We had read that mint tea and water were always available but this is clearly not the case. As arrangements for our pick up the next morning had not been made my wife raised this with Nadia who phoned Atlas Voyages who spoke to my wife. The pick up was agreed at 7.30 and Nadia said she would make breakfast for 7.00. When we returned from our evening meal a man who did not introduce himself but spoke English repeated that breakfast would be served at 7.00.  After we went to bed there was a tremendous argument between a woman and a man who we believe were connected to the riad and not guests.. This ricocheted round the central courtyard and continued until midnight when they left the building. No one reappeared before we had to leave at 7.30 so had to buy breakfast at the airport.  Clearly there are serious management issues at this place and we have reported our concerns to Fleetway Travel who arranged the package and await a response. It is worrying that guests are left alone in the building overnight maintenance standards have slipped badly and breakfasts are not provided as expected.  This is a shame because there is a lovely small pool and roof terrace and it is only about a 25 minute walk to the main square. The Saadian Tombs Badii Palace and Bahia Palace are nearby - the latter in particular was very impressive. One night we ate in the main square in one of the pop-up restaurants - despite the crowds there was ample choice and seats the food was excellent and cheap; just take a seat and choose a selection of Moroccan dishes. We did not feel hassled by the various traders and thoroughly enjoyed the lively atmosphere. We had a drink on a roof terrace overlooking the square which is well worth doing and not at all expensive.,Date of stay: July 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Exmouth, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KeithP1950
Riad Shemsi,PatsyPim wrote a review Jul 2014,50,Peaceful & Friendly,We stayed here for 2 nights at the beginning of June. We were welcomed with mint tea by the pool whilst we filled out the necessary paperwork. Noura (the owner) explained everything to us and gave us a map with a route from the Riad to the main square along with some recommendations of restaurants. She was very friendly and helpful.  We stayed in the chocolate suite at the top of the Riad - the room was huge and had a lovely terrace just outside. We had lunch in the Riad on our first day it was delicious and all freshly prepared. Water and mint tea was free throughout our stay.  The Riad is a very quiet part of the town so it is lovely and peaceful when you return from the hustle and bustle of the centre! It is only a short walk to some shops and the local market and the main square and souks are a 15 - 20 stroll away.

Riad Shemsi,DorsetVicky wrote a review Jun 2014,50,Quiet getaway,After the hustle and bustle of the streets this is very tranquil and a perfect place to get away. I even decided to continue working on my book one morning - no children telephone calls and just more haggling to look forward to.  Some local teenagers showed us the way to the riad when we were lost and proceeded to ask us for money every time we came back. Be warned that this is a precedent that the locals wish to avoid. I told them that if they asked for directions in England I would have given then happily without expectations of a reward.  In the main square we practically had 200 dirham snatched from our hands by the snake men. Nothing is free! Someone died two months ago from a bite from a cobra whose teeth had not been filed so therein lies a warning. Riad Monceau provided a wonderful patisserie course the highlight of this trip for me.

Riad Shemsi,Karen P wrote a review Jun 2014,50,Lovely & Quiet,What a little gem. Prior to going I contacted Riad Shemsi and they replied very quickly and this efficiency was just how the Riad was run. We stayed at the Riad Shemsi for three nights. Arrived at 10pm and was greeted with mint tea and cakes very welcome. We stayed in the turquoise room which is really spacious and has a very big shower. The bed and pillows were very comfy and the air conditioning unit was the quietest unit we have ever had. Breakfast was simple bread pancakes and home-made yoghurt jam and cheese with tea. Enough to see you through to lunchtime. Mohammed was very accommodating with our early start on two days and had breakfast ready for us. The pool was an added bonus after a hot day out we spent a couple of hours each evening relaxing before going to dinner.    Tea and water was available free of charge any time day or night. On our last day we were not due to leave until 6pm and they let us keep our room on. A tax was organised by the Riad and was there early to collect us for the airport.    Well done Riad Shemsi you are up there at the top of my list.,Date of stay: June 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Harrogate, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravellersHarrogate
Riad Shemsi,Kirsty L wrote a review Jun 2014,50,Tranquility in the Kasbah,Road Shemsi deserves to be much further up the best list of places to stay in Marrakech. It was stunning. There are a few twists and turns down narrow alleys to reach it but when you do there is an oasis of calm behind the large wooden door. Spotlessly clean stylish and such lovely staff. Make sure you check out the lovely roof terrace. The breakfast was great and the mint tea and pastries much appreciated. The room was lovely with a really comfortable bed and good shower. The aircon wasn't hugely effective but that would probably more of an issue in hotter months. The lovely pool area provided such a contrast the madness of the streets of Marrakech. I would definitely encourage you all to stay here.,Date of stay: June 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, England, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KirstyL874
Riad Shemsi,EmmiEdwards wrote a review May 2014,50,Lovely Marrakech stay,We stayed at Riad Shemsi for 2 nights and really enjoyed our stay. It feels like you are staying on someone's home. The decor is beautiful our room was on the ground floor- which we didn't mind it had a small but adequate shower room and the rooms decor was traditionally Moroccan which was nice. There is a pool but we didn't use it- we did use the roof top terrace which provides a peaceful getaway from the busy streets. Being in the south of Marrakech it is close to some of the main tourist attractions and only a 15-20 minuite walk to the souks. I would recommend staying here if you like boutique B&Bs :),Date of stay: April 2014,,"Leighton Bromswold, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EmmiEdwards
Riad Shemsi,finedinerStAlbans wrote a review Apr 2014,50,Cool in the Kasbah -,My husband and I with our 2 teenage daughters stayed here for 5 nights in the Berbere bedroom and the Orange bedroom which are next to each other.  We travelled in early April as we were expecting the temperature to be around 25C but summer came early which meant most days it was around 35C!! This made us extremely grateful for the pool (definitely a swimming pool NOT a plunge pool at 1.2m deep and roughly 20ft x 10ft) which we used a lot to cool off in.  The Riad is truly beautiful only 6 rooms very peaceful each room traditionally but stylishly decorated with air conditioning great showers delicious Bains de Marrakech soap shampoo shower gel and body milk a safe in each room and very firm matresses! Plenty of towels for the bathroom and by the pool and large towelling robes which we used by the pool as well. Most importantly for our 2 daughters free Wifi throughout the Riad!  The roof terraces are both beautifully done with the tented area a great shady place to sit or plenty of smart loungers to lie in the sun surrounded by potted plants and flowers.  We had pre booked a meal for the first night at the Riad as we knew we wouldn't be arriving till 8pm. I'm so glad we did as our flight was delayed and we didn't end up getting to the Riad till much later but it was no problem for the cook who had waited for us and then proceeded to cook us a beautiful Morrocan meal - I would thoroughly recommend having a meal there.  Breakfast which is served from 8.30 till 10.30am every day was delicious - freshly squeezed orange juice homemade yoghurt jams breads and Berber pancakes and eggs cooked to order. I know one reviewer commented that there was no variety in the breakfast and whilst the above was on offer every day there was also sometimes dried fruits sometimes fresh fruit then either croissants or pain au chocolate or homemade Maderia cake I also had scrambled eggs which were beautifully cooked and spiced with cumin - with so much choice it would have been hard to be bored with the food! Oh and hot chocolate every day for my daughters.  Mohammed who is there from about 5pm till about 10.30am each day is a quiet gentle soul who is very helpful and will book or sort out anything for you - I was a bit of a pain - booking treatments and taxis and then cancelling them when our plans changed but he never batted an eyelid or made me feel I was being difficult!  The ladies who run cook and clean the Riad during the day are charming - very little Englishbut if you don't speak French you can make yourself understood. The Riad is spotless and even though my daughters were a quite messy in their bedroom the maid tidied and cleaned their room every day always with a big smile. As other reviewers have mentioned it is incredibly quiet at Riad Shemsi as it is tucked away down a back alley at the bottom of the mainly residential area of the Kasbah this means there are very few tourists around however it is still only a 20 minute stroll to the main square (Jemaa el Fna).  This meant that on several occasions we felt very comfortable leaving our young teenage daughters there sunbathing and swimming for couple of hours whilst we visited some sights they weren't interested in.  Having visited the much busier noisier far more touristy North Medina I was so glad we weren't staying there.  I don't think Riad Shemsi would be suitable for large noisy groups unless taking over the whole Riad.  Mint tea coffee juice and water are provided free of charge and we would often have coffee on the roof terrace when we returned at night which was lovely. I honestly can't fault Riad Shemsi it offered far more than I was expecting for the price and I think its only fault is underselling itself - I didn't realise until I got there that I could have had a cookery course there massage treatments there and many trips can be booked from there including guides round the city! Would definitely return. I just hope all these comments get passed on to the staff?,Date of stay: April 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,St Albans,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/finedinerStAlbans
Riad Shemsi,peterdan wrote a review Mar 2014,30,Chocolate suite good value,The entry way and (small/very cold) plunge pool are beautiful. To lounge there after the noisy market (medina) area you need to pass through every time you come and go anywhere is a real pleasure. The suite is on the third floor (no elevator) and feels like you have the entire roof area to yourselves as the terrace is there too. (Maybe noisy if guests are partying in Summer?) The owner was not there apparently having a baby and the relief staff were nice enough but dropped the ball by having breakfast ready AFTER we were scheduled to be picked up by our city tour guide. No breakfast big tour not good ! Mohammed (nice guy) the night man forgot it was Sunday (stores open later apparently). He also locked himself out for an hour until I happened by. There was no food service offered and that's not a bad thing as the Les Jardins de la Medina riad is steps away and has a great restaurant atmosphere full staff and they change money for guests---at the official rate.,Date of stay: March 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Los Angeles, Ca.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peterdan
Riad Shemsi,Gerri S wrote a review Mar 2014,40,Pre Chrismas break,"After deciding to take a break before the madness of Christmas we settled on Marrakech as our destination. A friend recommended Riad Shemsi so we checked it out on line and booked it up 18th - 23rd December.    We were picked up from the airport and as we drove to the Riad I did have to question had we made the right decision which was reinforced when the driver stopped in a busy seemingly run down part of town without speaking got out of the car dragged our bags out and headed of into the maddening crowed! Keeping up with him as he ducked down ever narrowing allies I did start to worry. After a few minutes we came to a dead end with just a big door in front of us.......All my fears were allayed once we entered Riad Shemsi was a beautiful peaceful haven far from the chaos we had encountered outside.    We were greeted by Noura and served mint tea with nibbles by the pool then left to relax and take in the calm before she came back to provided a mapseveral recommendations for places to visit and take us to our room.    The room was a little on the small side but perfectly adequate although we did have a few issues with the heating not working and the electrics playing up but that didn't detract from our enjoyment and the staff were very helpful in resolving the issues without delay.    We could not have been better located once we learnt our way around we found we could walk to the Square Souks and New town also it is in a quieter part of the Medina which you will appreciate as Marrakech gives new meaning to the words ""hectic"" and ""chaotic"" but don't be put off by this you really do learn to embrace the madness and roll with it.    The thing about Marrakech is that you never know what is behind the rundown facades and trust me you will always be surprised by the opulence it hides. It was a great place to visit full of sights and smells (not all good!) and never a dull moment. Alcohol is pretty much banned in the old city although there are a few hotels that serve drinks but you will pay a hefty price for the privilege - around 140 dirhams for a bottle (same wine costs about 8 dirhams at the airport)  in fact one place we went into charged 130 dirhams a glass.....yes a glass! and the Riad does not have a bar. Needless to say it was a very health holiday lots of walking and little alcohol and one we truly enjoyed.",Date of stay: December 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Chichester,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GerriS_12

The riad is beautifully presented and spotlessly clean but it is the lovely service that takes it to the next level. Noura and Mohammed and so friendly and make you feel so welcome during your stay. They are there if you need them nothing being too much trouble or you are left to relax and enjoy the peace if that is what you want.    The riad is an oasis of calm in hectic Marrakech and it is great to return to of an evening after the day wandering around. Noura provided a map on arrival and we stumbled across a number or recommendations in our wanderings; all of them great.    Highly recommended and would definitely return.

Riad Shemsi,Carl H wrote a review Jul 2013,50,Excellent,"My girlfriend and I stayed at Shemsi from the 2nd to 6th of July in the middle of Moroccan summer (hot with a capital H). We were expecting alot from this place due to all the good reviews by previous patrons and we were thoroughly suprised. Riad Shemsi is a true oasis in the Medina and far exceeded our expectations! The staff are very attentive uninstrusive and could offer genuine advice on places to eat and see. We stayed in the Chocolate Suite which is by any standards a lovely room and the rest of the Riad is equally immaculate and well appointed. The swimming pool was greatly appreciated and although not olympic in size it is a genuine pool and not a converted fountain.    On arrival the AC was faulty and after 15 minutes a repairman showed up. I assume he could not fix it as he was given a (descrete but audiable) ear ache from the woman in charge and shortly afterwards another man showed up and to fixed the fault after a good hours work. I am familiar with ear ache regardless of culture or language...    The location is perfect as it is easy to find after a walk round the Souks and also because it is in a quieter (and cleaner) part of the Medina - which you will really appreciate as Marrakech gives new meaning to the words ""hectic"" and ""chaotic"".    The food and drink offered are of good quality at a fair price. Water english tea mint tea and juice were offered FOC (all day and night) as well as light breakfast (served upon request) consisting of maroccan pancakes baguette jam and natural yoghurt with a choice of tea or coffee. My only comment would be that the seasoning is suited to european taste which will suit most but probably not foodies.    Finally I must add that I am a rather spoilt traveller who usually stays at rediculosly over priced resorts and hotels - and I'm usually rather dissapointed.

Riad Shemsi,Hazel M wrote a review Nov 2012,50,A Haven of Peace,As we were staying in Riad Shemsi for a week we decided to book the Chocolate Suite and we did not regret it. The room was spacious with a comfortable bed. The large shower room had lovely toiletries and bath robes.  Breakfast is very nice with delicious homemade yogurt but there was no variety. We had two lovely evening meals in the Riad and another in Les Jardins de Medina very close by. (booked by the Riad)  It takes more than 15 minutes to walk to Jmaa El Fna through the hustle and bustle of the very busy Marrakech streets. It was hotter than we expected so the air conditioning in our room was most welcome on a few occasions.  The Riad booked the trip to the Atlas Mountains for us. It is expensive but we really enjoyed it. We walked for two hours with a local guide and learned a great deal about the Berber way of life. To take advantage of this you do need to be able to walk on steep rocky ground.  Riad Shemsi is a lovely place to come back to after a hectic hot day. All the staff were friendly welcoming and helpful and I became addicted to the wonderful sweet mint tea.

The taxi we booked with the hotel dropped us on the main street and didnt even show us to the door. dont book a taxi with the hotel over priced. We were greeted by abdellah with tea and biscuits. Wow! amazing! such a beautiful riad modern yet traditional. We had the whole place to ourselves for 5 days!  Plus - breakfast included air-conditioning clean root top terrace for sunbathing pool when in the hot august heat out of town peace and quiet 'vanilla' room was a bargain - your paying the same price for a mid-range riad as you would for a not very nice riad closer to the square. staff very helpful informed us on everything and helped us plan the rest of the trip. the kasbah (area of medina it was in) is nicer than the central or north medina wider streets better lit.  negative - poor selection for breakfast it is a 25 minute walk to jammaa el fna not a pleasnt one either especially when its 40 degrees. get a taxi back at night. not much around the kasbah.  overall the riad was so gorgeous it made our trip!!! would million percent recommend and go back. marrakech can be overwhelming so it was thankful to have a place like here to chill out in and have peace and quiet!,Date of stay: August 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Cheltenham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rosier_91

Riad Shemsi,Morgan S wrote a review Oct 2012,50,"Lovely, Large Riad with a Great Pool",We traveled with our 2-year-old to Marrakesh in October and were delighted to find that Riad Shemsi met our family needs perfectly. We've heard that small riads can be tough to have toddlers in (since sound carries so well) but this was a lovely riad with the perfect sized pool and terraces for a little one. The staff was fantastic with our daughter and made our stay that much better. Breakfast on that beautiful terrace is wonderful!    We took a wonderful cooking class with the sweetest kindest chef and shopped for all ingredients beforehand with the staff. They also arranged for a tour of the city with an English speaking guide which we thought was wonderful - but didn't realize they charged by the person and ended up paying twice as much as we expected. Oops! And don't let the guide not walk you home telling you the riad is 'easy to find'. We were lost for a good hour at night before we found our way through the winding medina back to Riad Shemsi. This location is in the newer part of the Medina (by new it's not 'new' - you're still in authentic Morocco) but is a short walk to the main souks. Out of the hustle and bustle. Our only criticism might be the decor - very classy and modern but I was hoping for something much more Morrocan (the boxy velvet furniture could easily be updated with authentic decor). Overall we felt incredibly safe and were happy to have found this riad!    Thanks to Peter for helping to arrange our stay!

The riad is lovely with the suite we stayed in large and comfortable with a very nice bathroom. Abdellah the manager could not have been more helpful. The location is in the ""posh"" end of the medina handy for the palace and Kosybar etc and its easier to negotiate than the northern Medina. The score reflects the price relative to other riads we have stayed in. Lovely though it is you can rent a 3-4 bed riad in its entirety with similar high levels of service for the same price (though you wouldn't get a swimming pool which in the heat was a real luxury). So it is perfectly good value relative to most hotels- with the exception of our final lunch which we did find a little steep (€28 for 2 omlettes & salad).

Actually coming from India and living in a villa amidst slums was not very relaxing a hotel would be more suitable. The place itself was not the issue. The Riad was definitely very well done clean welcoming staff (Noura Nadia Abdella) except Mr Rude Badr. I think Mr. Badr was upset because we did not take his recommendation for restaurants. The simple rooms with nice colours thoughful art decor are all very charming. Small nice terrace. Lovely welcome with mint tea and rasted almonds.

We were far from disappointed and had a fabulous stay. The riad was lovely and the staff Nora Nadia Kadija and Bader so very kind nothing was too much trouble  they were very attentive yet descreet at the same time. We stayed in the Chocolate suite which is located on the lower terrace. The room was very spacious and had a very comfortable bed good shower with bathrobes complimentary toiletries and personal safe. Although it was warm and sunny during the day the temperature did drop at night but our room was heated and Bader the guardien would also lite a fire in our room for us every evening.  We had dinner at the riad one evening and it was probably the best tagine we had during our stay.  The riad is located in the Royal Kasbah district and about a 20 minute pleasant walk to the main square. I'm glad we didn't stay too close to the square as it is very noisy and the Kasbah area is accessible by car and the streets seem wider and better lit than other parts we visited.  Marrakech is great but very full on so after a long day in the souks and sight seeing it was just so wonderful to get back to the peace and quiet and relax either by the pool or up on the sun soaked terrace!

Riad Shemsi,Ashley L wrote a review Nov 2011,50,Wonderful sanctuary amidst the hustle and bustle,Wonderful staff here who made us very welcome. Their knowledge and tips were also very welcome - I cannot thank them enough. If you go - ask them to organise a trip to the mountains (which in itself isnt exciting particularly) and to stop off for lunch in Richard Bransons Mountain Resort - this was very special if you are on a romantic trip or for any special occasion. The room we stayed in which was the Chocolate Suite was roomy and clean. You can choose to have your breakfast on the terrace which is both informal and relaxing. The food which we had at the riad was also very good. In all - lovely place lovely people and I would go again without any hesitation whatsoever.,Date of stay: November 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Weston super Mare, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashthetourist
Riad Shemsi,daniella R wrote a review Nov 2011,50,Lovely Riad in Kasbah area of Medina,Wonderful place that I came across simply by mistake after giving up on all the hundreds of other so-so riads on the internet- very glad I did. Would definitely recommend for relaxing holiday to Marrakech. Staff very helpful rooms beautifully decorated warm hospitality and clean! Something lacking in other places in Morocco! Had a relaxing few days trip away it was still very hot in Marrakech in mid October. The staff were all helpful in recommending where to go and ordering taxis etc. (we were recommended a very 'moroccan' restaurant by the owner and the food was delicious) this is one of the places in the medina taxis have acess to which is handy. All in all a great Riad good location if you're willing to walk a bit or the taxis are so cheap you don't need to and tranquil atmosphere inside away from the hustle of the medina.,Date of stay: October 2011,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Letchworth Garden City, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daniellaR725

Shemsi is in a great part of the Medinaand we both felt safe walking around both in the day and also at night.  Our first night dinner was in the riad and was very filling and delicious.  The weather was in the high 80's better than july last year when it was in the 100's.we were able to venture much further in to the souks which are more interesting than the sellers on the outside.we especially wanted to see the dyers souk and with Nourha from Shemsi's help (she directed us on my map)we found it although getting out without being wrapped in scarfs to buy was difficult . we returned to the Riad for a lovely refreshing dip in the pool and a great pot of English teaserved by the Lovely staff.Thanks for a Super stay!!,Date of stay: October 2011,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"london, england",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michimoo

Things just got better!  We arrived early to be met with tea shown to our delightful rooms and then had 3 great days. The staff were very attentive and helpful food - evening and lunches- was excellant ( even gave some cookery lessons!) . Restaurants were happily booked for us and taxi's if required.  Location was good all tranquil but the main square was about 15-20 min walk  Would happily recommend all of the rooms and indeed the Riad!

Riad Shemsi,Amanda M wrote a review Oct 2011,40,An oasis of calm amongst the craziness!,Whilst fighting my way through the massive number of Riads advertising on the internet Riad Shemsi was recommended to me by a friend and I was glad of the help with choosing a place to stay in Marrakech. The position of the Shemsi is good. It is in the Kasbah near the Royal Palace and about 15 minutes from the Square. As we were short on cash and had spent most of our money on the accommodation we didn't mind the walk. I see that a lot of people took taxis but I think they miss out on a lot of interaction and chances to soak up the culture.    The Riad itself is a delight with beautiful decoration a lovely little pool excellent staff and a gentle atmosphere. I would recommend the peace and tranquility if you are spending any time in Marrakech. The food in the Riad was extremely good but for us pricey. The food in the square is fine and we were more interested in seeing the country and meeting the people than fine dining and expensive places focused on western tastes. If you are looking for exclusivity the staff are very helpful with their excursions but on future trips I would rather find my way around on local buses and taxis.    In general Marrakech is hectic chaotic and extremely busy but I did not feel unsafe. The trick is to not engage anyone you don't want to speak to or buy something from. Just walk away. The culture is a lifetime away from what we have here in UK and it is a useful reality check. The Riad is an oasis of calm amongst the craziness outside. If you are looking for pretty clean and peaceful then this is your bag. It is difficult to get prices on the net. Remember that everything in Marrakech is negotiable. Overall a good experience.,Date of stay: September 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Sudbury, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/15AmandaM
Riad Shemsi,Susan G wrote a review Sep 2011,50,A Haven of Tranquility,"Riad Shemsi was a wonderful home from home on a recent trip to Marrakech. This stunning riad is filled authentic touches and Nourah Lesson Nadja and the rest of the team are incredibly helpful and welcoming. The food was delicious and of course the setting even better. I really felt I had been transported into different world and our short break (4 nights) felt a lot longer due to how quickly I relaxed. The roof terrace was ideal for catching some sun and the shaded terrace a great retreat when it got too hot. This riad is ideally situated for exploring the kasbah main square and souks and returning ""home"" to such a lovely welcome and place makes for the perfect break. Nourah helped us by giving advice on our restaurant choices and booking them for us. There were so many restaurants to choose from and the ones we visited were great.

Our room (Turquoise) had a very comfortable kingsize bedonsuite and again was tastefully furnished. It opened onto its own balcony overlooking the courtyard and pool.Noura was very pleasant and helpful and nothing was too much trouble. Noura was also happy to point out places on the map we wanted to visit .This was a haven of tranquility to return to after visiting the souks or sights and with the weather at 40c the ice cold pool was a welcome relief.A big thank you to Peter the manager letting us use the room due to our late departure and to Noura Lahcen Nadia and Khadija "" Berakalaufic"" (Blessings upon you)  We will return to Marrakech in the future and will look forward to returning to Riad Shemsi.  p.s.

I liked the reviews on TA and Shemsi itself is lovely and I echo what Marubenjem said in their review. The staff are attentive and always smiling. We (1 couple 1 single) stayed 4 nights and it was lovely to come back and sit on the terrace and drink tea or wine before bed. The location is great walking distance to all the medina sites and an inexpensive taxi ride to the new town. The weather was good and it was wonderful to be able to swim around in the pool. Liz the owner was there and she is a bundle of energy with lots of recommendations and a real desire to see that you have a relaxing holiday. Best of all .... no TV!!

Riad Shemsi,Marubenjem wrote a review Apr 2011,50,Great chill out time in a super-relaxed environment,My wife and 2 friends left our teenage kids at home for a 3-night stay in Marrakech - our first time there. A friend had recommended the Riad Shemsi and it did not disappoint. It is located in the Kasbah part of old Marrakech (the Medina) and an enjoyable stroll to the major places to see (the main square souk new town etc) and is tucked down an alley off an alley off an alley. Once inside the Riad you feel like you are home from home. All the staff are so friendly - special mention should go to Noura Ashraf Lechse (sp ??) while the Riad itself is very clean comfortable and delightfully decorated. Our most enjoyable evening in Marrakech was our 3rd of the 3 nights when we simply stayed 'in' sitting in the common area by the pool playing 'Articulate' while we downed a few bottles of the local wine. We were the only guests left by then and we felt like it was our private home in Marrakech. It was a great experience. so thanks to Elizabeth and her great staff and we hope to be back again.

The breakfast is lovely with homemade yoghurt and freshly pressed juice. We also had lunch and dinner one night at the riad and it was one of the best meals we had during our stay.

We stayed in the 'orange suit' which was plenty big enough for 3 very clean with nice touches such as dressing gowns. The Riad has a plunge pool and a nice roof terrace with sunbeds and great views to the Atlas Mountains. The staff were lovely and a big thanks to Elizabeth the owner who gave us lots of hints and tips and arranged dinner for us each night we ate in the Riad the first night which I would highly recommend the food was very good. The Riad arranged for a pick up from the airport which took the hassle out of bartering with a taxi as soon as we arrived we were also dropped off again at the end of the stay.  For anyone looking for a nice Riad for a few days stay in Marrakesh I would recommend Riad Shemsi although its not located right by the square the location is actually great as it is away from the hussle and bussle and the south side of the square is def. more tourist friendly than the north.,Date of stay: March 2011,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Edinburgh, UK",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Silver15

Nothing was too much trouble and the atmosphere in the Shemsi was so relaxed. If you want to be in the centre of the medina where you can see all the tradition but stay in a tranquil beautiful riad the shemsi is perfect.

Riad Shemsi,CarolineHampshire wrote a review Mar 2011,40,Lovely escape,On the advice of a friend we booked this 6 roomed luxurious Riad for our first experience of Marrakech. We had the Turquoise room on the second floor whose décor was slightly more dated than the advertising pictures had suggested but was nevertheless spotlessly kept clean on a daily basis-the bed had a bit of a lean to one side which increased with the days but otherwise the room was a wonderful place to rest our heads at the end of each day.The huge shower worked welltoilet and basin cleaned/polished daily and used towels were replaced each day adding to its pleasure.  Others mentioned they were woken by the nearby mosque at 0530 but the only noise we heard was that of some local birds who had invaded the inner courtyard and sang their praises of the morning at a reasonable hour!  The Riad is a good 20 minute walk from the middle of town Souk area which we enjoyed although the return trip when tired avoiding the motorbikes push-bikes taxis and animal led transport was more tiresome!! It was always a relief however to return to the tranquillity of Riad Shemsi for any number of cups of English tea(sweet local mint tea also on offer of course!) and a bit of peace from the hectic Marrakech street life.  We had an in-house meal on the first and last nights to the accompaniment of local wine-the food as good as anything we had had outside and the waiting service relaxed and unobtrusive-Meals could be had anywhere in the place  or anytime you desired!,Date of stay: March 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Fareham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarolineHampshire

The atmosphere was very calm and relaxing. We stayed in the Chocolate Suite at the top of the house which was a lovely big room from where you could step out onto the terrace to sip some mint tea or take the steps up to the sun terrace. The riad was extremely clean and we wanted for nothing. The staff at Riad Shemsi led by the super-efficient and helpful Noura were fantastic. From arranging taxis to booking lunch for us at Richard Branson's hotel in the Atlas Mountains to providing a 7-course Moroccan meal for us and 4 other guests (thanks Nadia) on New Years Eve...nothing was too much trouble.

Riad Shemsi,NoChildren wrote a review Nov 2010,50,Riad Shemsi feels like home.,It is a tranquil oasis on the edge of the mayhem that is Marrakech. Each of its spaces be it the pool area in the shade of the ground floor or the canopied splendour of the rooftop terrace is an inviting place to be. All are beautifully furnished decorated and lit.    But that is only part of the reason for the welcoming and homely feel that the place exudes; the food too is wonderful with an unpretentious and fresh Moroccan menu.    Best of all though are the genuine and warm staff. It is impossible to single out one star – they are all part of a well led well trained team. If you are really lucky the owner Liz will be in town with her enthusiasm and simple philosophy that Riad Shemsi must at all times and for all the best of reasons be a place that guests want to spend time in and wish to come back to again and again.

Riad Shemsi,tt1010 wrote a review Oct 2010,50,Fantastic break in Marrakech,Leaving a hotel review is a first for us but having chosen a place to stay largely based on Trip Advisor comments we feel the least we can do is add our own.    My first comment is a 'thank you' to all those people who have previously reviewed Riad Shemsi - everything you say is true. It really is the perfect place to stay.    Our escape to Marrakesh was to celebrate our wedding anniversary and was made as memorable as it was by our hosts at Rhiad Shemsi - our welcome from owner Liz and her staff was warm and generous and we felt more like house guests than hotel residents.    The Rhiad was beautifully decorated in typical Moroccan style and our room the Chocolate Suite was a luxurious treat on the top floor of the house.  Riad Shemsi is close enough to the city to walk (or a very cheap taxi ride) and very easy to find when you return - the importance of which is not to be under-estimated! But it is also far enough out of the Medina to offer tranquility at the end of the day.    We ate in Shemsi on the first night (the ideal way to start your stay) Tanjia (fantasic food but the service left a bit to be desired) Riad Monceau (a real treat in every possible way) and L’Annexe (you can have too many tagines so thought this French restaurant in the new town might be a good idea – it was OK and not expensive but I suspect there are better alternatives).    Marrakesh is a spectacular place and certainly not for the faint hearted. The assault on your senses is extreme - the red city is a mass of colour sound heat taste and smells - a really thrilling break.,Date of stay: September 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Leiden, The Netherlands",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tt1010

Riad Shemsi,T1andT2 wrote a review Oct 2010,50,A wonderful oasis of calm in a mad city,What more can I say? It's all been said in the previous reviews.This is THE place to stay when you're visiting Marrakech. The staff were very friendly and the owner went out of her way to help us find our way around and generally make sure our stay was most enjoyable. Our room (Turquoise) was great - just like the picture on the website and such a change from characterless hotel rooms. Loved slipping into the plunge pool after the heat of sunbathing on the roof. Tried plunging into it and succeeded in soaking everybody and everything near by! We had dinner here on our first night and also visited the Tajine and Fondouk restaurants. All excellent. Definitely not to be missed.,Date of stay: October 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Marlow, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T1andT2
Riad Shemsi,phil190748 wrote a review Oct 2010,50,Riad Shemsi - a haven of tranquility in an amazing city,Marrakech is an amazing assault on your senses the noise the smells the hussle and bussle are like nothing I'd experienced before. We were greeted at the airport and within minutes were negotiating the frantic traffic as we made our way into the medina. The taxi dropped us in a side road and we were wondering what have we let ourselves in for! However a short walk later and we arrived at Riad Shemsi which I can only describe as an oasis of calm and peacefulness. We were met by Liz the owner and members of her staff who were all exceptionally friendly and helpful throughout our stay. They made reservations for us booked our day trip into the mountains and helped with general queries and advice always with a smile and with our intentions first. The Orange Suite was extremely comfortable maybe even exotic and the views from the roof terrace were amazing. This was a fantastic short break one of the best we have ever had and Riad Shemsi and Liz and the staff contributed massively to it.,Date of stay: September 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Huddersfield, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/phil190748

The riad was amazing so were the staff all of whom spoke really good English and helped in any way possible. The location is just perfect as your close to the medina and the new city. During the day we would sunbathing on the roof which overlooked the palace and at nights we would head on a short walk to the markets and enjoy the local cusines. The breakfast was great all fresh every morning. Overall I would defiantly come back here again and would recommend to all my friends.,Date of stay: September 2010,,london,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/assyrian187

Elizabeth the hostess has a wealth of knowledge and make you feel at home from the minute you get there until the minute you leave. Felt like we were staying with friends not in a hotel.  Good location walking distance from the action and with some great restaurants nearby.  Rooms were very clean and well presented in a traditional style and the Riad offers a fantastic roof terrace!  Would definitely stay at Shemsi when i return to Marrakech.  Advise emailing the Riad directly if you want to book.

Riad Shemsi,Grewell wrote a review Sep 2010,50,A haven of peace amidst the noise and bustle of the Kasbah,After a week on the coast the noise dust heat and bustle of Marrakech was almost overwhelming. Entering Riad Shemsi was like entering a different world. We received a friendly welcome to this wonderful place and the staff continued to be attentive and helpful - nothing was too much trouble.  The cool and calm riad has been well designed successfully blending the traditional with the new. The plunge pool and the two roof-top terraces make it special. The rooms are lovingly designed and make the most of the space available (we stayed in the Turquoise Room).  We would thoroughly recommend it to anyone visiting Marrakech.,Date of stay: September 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Odiham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Grewell
Riad Shemsi,Jaki1 wrote a review Sep 2010,50,a little bit of heaven on earth!,My 2 girlfriends and i have just returned last night and we most certainly did not want to leave the Riad Shemsi it was quite simply devine. From the moment the large carved door opened and we stepped inside we could not have asked for more. The riad was beautiful the decor stunning and as we made our way up stairs each floor of the riad did not disappoint the amazing pool the lovely dining room on up to the shaded seating area which was wonderfull to sit and chill with a glass of wine whatever time of day altho late evening when all the morroccan lamps were alight was hard to beat. The call to prayer in the background added to the atmosphere s you sat and watched the sun go down. It was quite simply wonderfull.......Our room was the Chocolat suite  there was plenty of space for the 3 of us and the decor was again lovely not often on holiday you are in a room you really really dont want to leave. The top sun terrace had comfortable sun beds but sitting in the heat to long a challenge but the cooling pool to plunge into was such a bonus and it was big enough to actually swim in. Finally i have to mention all the staff who were polite and extremely helpfull nothing ever a problem. All the restaurants we had asked to be pre booked before our arrival had been booked on the right day and time and were all great Breakfast each day was served with a smile and was delicious.We are planning our next trip back to Riad Shemsi already as they made us so welcome and we never go back to the same place twice!!,Date of stay: September 2010,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Cirencester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jaki1

Riad Shemsi,Mrs-B-loves wrote a review Jul 2010,50,Oasis of calm and good taste.,Riad Shemsi is a wonderful oasis of calm hidden away in the madness of Marrakech.  The whole Riad is beautifully decorated and a pleasure to spend time in.  Marrakech in July is blisteringly hot and the cool pool was most welcome when returning from a day of sightseeing. Pool towels are provided and there are lounging chairs by the pool where we would doze off reading in the afternoon.  All the staff and very friendly and nothing is too much trouble. On our last night we had a wonderful meal in the Riad with wine. As we had to leave early to catch out plane. Hassan offered to prepare our breakfast early..which was so kind.  Our evenings always started sat by the pool and served G&T s before we ventured out to the many wonderful evening venues available in Marrakech.

Having a swimming pool made such an amazing difference to our stay in Marrakesh - we wished we had stayed here at the start of our trip! The breakfast was very good - including the delicious home made yogurt. Liz the owner couldn't have been more helpful friendly and accommodating allowing us to stay on until our flight home was due way beyond our check out time.

Riad Shemsi,michimoo wrote a review Jul 2010,50,A Fab Time,Arrived home yesterday from one of my best holidays evermade even more special by the great staff and setting of Riad Shemsi.  As soon as we walked in we knew we had made the right choicethe beautiful roomsgreat decor and serene plunge pool A tranquil setting to the crazy town outside! The service and atmosphere were spot on .  3 of us were staying in the orange suite on a girlie 5 day break and it was perfect.  Liz and her great staff helped us so much where to go and what to do (we had been a bit disappointed on our first trip into the Souk but on the advice from Liz we ventured further in and we found just what we were looking for)  The Riad sorted out all our taxis for us and also booked restaurants that we had on our list or that Liz recommended.  We did walk around and explore during the day although first thing in the morning or late afternoon is best.  The Riad is in a great position about 15-20 minute walk into the main square and right in the Royal Kasbah where there is a small market (not for the sqeamish or vegetarians but a real eye opener!)  We really hope to have a return visit to lovely Riad Shemsi sometime in the very near future and i will most certainly recommend it as a must to anyone going on a trip wishing to see the real Marrakech,Date of stay: July 2010,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"london, england",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michimoo
Riad Shemsi,emjoy01 wrote a review Jul 2010,50,A true gem.,My partner and I bookended our 6-day Morocco trip with stays at Riad Shemsi - 2 days in the sumptuous Chocolate Suite and one in the lovelyTurqouise one. The two rooms are on different levels in the riad so we were able to fully appreciate the different spaces on each level - the terrace where we had out breakfast and lazily lounged and read (same level as the Chocolate Suite) and the dining room space on the first level where we did the same thing but experienced it in a different equally lovely way and are so glad we did this as all the different spaces in the riad are beautiful and peaceful in their own individual way and there is a serenity about the riad which is quite palpable.  We used the plunge pool (that is the daftest suggestion - to heat it!) had mint tea and read on the downstairs loungers and used the terrace late afternoon when the sun was down.  So what do I think of the riad? Quite simply it's a gem and I am dumbfounded as to why it is as low as it is on the Tripadvisor rankings.  Riad Shemsi has that balance of providing genuine caring personalised service yet you somehow feel the place is your own as though you were chilling in your own gorgoeus riad. The wonderful staff are there on hand to help in a hot second but you don't feel their presence - it's an amazing personally luxurious feeling and one which I've not experienced much on my many travels. We ambled casually from space to space as though the place was ours feeling that we were being pampered by the luxury of this - it's a great feeling when you're on holiday.  It is in the much quieter kasbah area so it away from the all madness and noise of the Place and surroundiing area which we were grateful for. Its a quick 10-minute walk to the Place.  When we came back to it from Essaouira to be welcomed with 'welcome home' from Elisabeth it really did honestly feel like coming back 'home' in all it's warm and wonderful connotations - and what a home!  Elisabeth the lovely owner was always on hand to help with any travel arrangements taxis to and from various eateries recommendations made calls for us on our behalf and was indispensable with her knowledge of the local culture and we shared many chats about all sorts of things. And the little homely touches like having a cup of tea brought to you when you get up @ 6am added to the specialness of the place.  The rooms are impeccably clean with A/C and decorated beautifully.  We had sandwiches and salad for lunch there one day as it was too hot to go out which were produced effortlessly for us. And we also had one of the best Moroccan meals during our stay on the terrace on our first night there - a delicious cooked aubergine salad lamb & prune tajine whole red mullet and fresh fruit - right up there with Al Fassia.  Elisabeth Paul and all the fantastic staff - thank you so much for making our stay so special and utterly memorable.

The hotel and rooms themselves were wonderfully designed and it has great food too!! They gave us a free upgrade straight away as they didn't have any occupants on those days in the most expensive rooms. The décor is as you would expect in a luxury 5 star oasis in busting Marrakesh (beautiful swimming pool and great views from the roof veranda). It is also really conveniently located with walking distance to all the sights in the city.

Riad Shemsi,crisswiss wrote a review Jul 2010,50,Best Riad in town,we stayed at the riad not knowing what to expect in Marrakesh. Instantly Liz the owner made us feel very much at ease and assured us she would do her utmost to meet our every need. Well she certainly did. She was an expert on the best places to eat and wow! were they good or what. We met Monks and belly dancers and lots of interesting people we even went mountain climbing and she even managed to book us a table at Richard Branson's lovely restaurant which was an experience in itself. The riad is wonderfulan oasis of lovliness. Drinks food were all on hand served by wonderful staff who were very friendly indeed. The decor is wonderful and the roof terrace overlooks the kings palace. there is a wonderfully cool dipping pool a must in the heat of the day. I would advise anyone to make this their place of stay in Marrakesh. We certainly will be back as soon as possible.

Riad Shemsi,Lyz C wrote a review Jul 2010,40,Charming Little Riad,We stayed at Riad Shemsi for two nights on our return from Ouarzazate. We love Marrakech but have never stayed in the Kasbah before so we chose this Riad. It is a small but perfectly formed Riad nestled in amongst local people's homes so you can get a taste of life in the Kasbah. We returned at night to find children playing cards a couple of doors down. All very charming and sweet.    We stayed in the Chocolate Suite on the 2nd floor. It was a quiet room but you can hear a buzz from a unit on the roof that kicks in now and again - not a big problem. I am sound sensitive and it didn't bother me. The room had a large bed beautiful bathroom and a seating area that we did not use because the room was too hot during the day and we wanted to be out and about anyway. There was air-con for the evening.    The riad is very tastefully furnished with a cool seating area at the side and a cold pool that is good for a dip if you can brave it! I would have loved a swim but was not able to get in past my knees!    The only downsides are that the pool needs to be heated there are no loungers on the ground floor and if you are wet after bathing in the pool you do not feel that you can sit on the furniture at the sides of the pool (the owner said not to dive in the pool as the furniture would be splashed so I took this as a sign!). So if you swim the choice is to walk dripping up three flights of stairs to the terrace or stand at the side of the pool.    The roof terrace is in desperate need of shade. There are no parasols or canopies up there so if you want to sunbathe it is 'go for the burn' or not at all. I went very earlyin the morning or at 6pm as anything else was unbearable. This is a shame as the roof terrace has a lovely view towards the palace.    Breakfast was very nice with yoghurt fruit compote french bread and the traditional 'galette' pancake. Liz the host is very helpful and arranged taxis to the airport 100 dirham.    The walk from the Kasbah to the main square takes about 10 minutes and is well worth doing. You really get a sense of Kasbah life. I felt safe at all times and as long as you know that there are people out there who want to guide you to here and there and ask money for it then you are fine. Most people are very friendly.    At some point in your stay head for Restaurant Chez Chegrouni. If you walk into the square from the main entrance where the horses are head towards the back left-hand side. You will find it opposite one of the smaller mosques. Go upstairs to the 2nd floor. and try to get a seat at the window. There is a great view you see a lovely sunset and at prayer time you get the call to prayer coming into the room - it is really something!! The food is authentic and cheap and no belly problems at all. The Chicken and Lemon tagine is really good.    If you fancy a Henna souvenir make sure you negotiate the price before you sit down and before the lady puts any henna on you. They will tell you that 'it's ok you can pay what you want' but this is not true and they can get rather stroppy. Make sure the price is what you are happy to pay. If you are not sure ask a few people that have already been done and ask them how much they paid. If you have sensitive skin don't go for black because it can burn.

Riad Shemsi,Andy wrote a review Jul 2010,50,"Beautiful, and perfect for a big birthday",Was taken to Marrakech for my 40th birthday. Brilliant city and we  couldn't have stayed anywhere better than Riad Shemsi.    Liz (the owner) and the staff were extremely welcoming making the stay  feel very much like staying in a lovely friendly home rather than some  impersonal hotel or guest house. The riad is simply beautiful -  comfortable chic and very well kept with everything you could need to  hand and nothing was too much trouble for the staff.    The trip was a surprise from my other half and little did I know that  Liz was also in on the surprise. Our parents arrived a couple of hours  after us and Liz ensured I knew nothing of their arrival until I saw  their faces at the door! We then had a lovely meal in the riad to round  off the first day.    Liz also made sure we were booked in at the nicest restaurants in town  and organised for a couple more surprise welcomes when we arrived at  them.    Perhaps a little corny to note but Riad Shemsi really is a peaceful  oasis in the middle of the buzz and bustle that is Marrakech.

Riad Shemsi,Janemc wrote a review Jul 2010,50,A gem,We have stayed in Marrakech before and rather than opt to stay again at the Maison d'Arabe we decided to try the other end of town for a change.What an excellent choice it turned out to be.......  As a rule we try hard to avoid crowds(and other tourists)preferring on the whole to keep things that little bit 'special'. The Shemsi was just fab from start to finish.Beautifully and tastefully decoratedit was just perfect. The fact that it has so few rooms makes it exclusive but given the general size of the place those guests present can spread themselves out very nicely indeed.The Chocolate Suite was recommended as it was our 25th Anniversary- again a very astute choice.We had previously been travelling around Morrocco by car and this was our last port of call before home.  The Shemsi proved to be the perfect blend of individualityclassspace peacequiet and privacy  all completely essential when staying in a busy city like Marrakech.  Liz the owner was lovely arranging everything for us from recommending restaurants to organising taxis so that we really didn't have to think about anything which was heaven.We already knew our way around so could spend the day visiting old haunts but equallybe updated by Liz on what new had changed since our last visit.Being of the greedy variety this obviously included the restaurants.(The Fondouk(rooftop) and Narwana were both excellent).  I would say the real pull of this place is the haven it offers after a days travels in the city.The pool is heavenly the rooftop terrace allows you to cool off and catch a few evening raysThe staff are attentive but incredibly discreet so you feel very much at home.  We very rarely go back to the same place twice but for this place we are going to make an exception.Why bother risking it when all you need is under one roof?

Riad Shemsi,madontravel_10 wrote a review Jun 2010,50,Sublime Riad Shemsi hits the spot,Holidaying with 12 girlfriends means trying to please everyone. Thankfully my choice of Riad more than satisfied.  On arrival dropped off by our great driver throughout - Rida (riad has his details) we entered the beautiful enchanting and exciting riad. With oohs and aahs from my friends I knew we had a winner.  We were lucky enough to have rented out the whole place for ourselves and as the birthday girl I chose the Chocolat room. To say it was perfect would be an understatement. It was the sort of room/suite you could only dream of having back home.  Everyone was delighted with their boudoirs - so nobody felt hard done by.  Other than the obvious good taste and luxury displayed at our 'home from home' was the feeling of total relaxation. The reason for this is the fantastic staff. We could not have asked for more. They were all lovely and so helpful. Asma the manager had helped me so much beforehand to ensure that we had everything booked and sorted so there were no stresses or suprises on arrival.  Not only would I recommend the riad - and in fact 2 friends of friends have already booked - I can't wait to go back.  Choose this riad and you really will have a holiday to remember. ps.

I am Vegetarian and this was easily catered for with a delicious Lentil dish and Morrocan rice plus a side dish of fresh tomato salad (my favorite). I enjoyed relaxing in the sunshine on the roof terrace with my partner and in the first few hours of being there was able to let stresses and lifes worries drift away if only for a few days! Staff we're ever helpful advising on good places to eat and visit and ringing ahead to make reservations. Both of which we're fantastic.

Riad Shemsi,ND1977 wrote a review May 2010,40,A hidden treasure...,My partner and I chose to stay at the Riad Shemsi for a long weekend break. They were extremely helpful in making the necessary arrangements before we arrived and welcomed us with tea by the pool when we got to the door.  The Riad is located towards the South of the city walls and is hidden away amongst the maze of small streets (although once you have your bearings it becomes easy to navigate on foot).  Marrakech is very busy with pedestrians horses bicycles and speeding mopeds - it never ceases to be a lovely feeling when you get to the huge wooden door that opens to the secluded tranquil & luxurious environment inside the Riad itself.  The ground floor has a small pool which is great to relax in during the afternoon & evening.  The rooms are spacious and very comfortable - you really get the feeling that you are in an ancient world with the Morrocan decor etc  On the top level there is a roof terrace where you can sunbathe take in the sights and sounds of the city and have a relaxing drink.  The staff are fantastic: professional discrete helpful well informed and really look after their guests.  There are plenty of restaurants sights souks and bars within easy walking distance.  I can recommend this Riad to couples without reservation.  A top class venue at an incerdibly reasonable rate!  Enjoy...

Riad Shemsi,Barjin wrote a review May 2010,40,"Super riad to stay in,has everything a visitor to Marrakech needs",An excellent riad in the heart of the Kasbah area within walking distance to many attractions. Riad Shemsi offers a haven of peace and charm with a lovely pool for those hot days delicious Moroccan food and very comfortable accommodation. The roof terrace one of the higher points of the area gives beautiful view s of the old city. The house has been carefully restored and offers a charming Moroccan environment enhanced by the lovely decor. The staff were fantastic helpful and a delight to meet.

Riad Shemsi,David H wrote a review May 2010,50,Truly a life saver......,We had four nights at the Shemsi just last week when a heat wave struck Marrakech and the temperature in the Medina soared to 42C. To be out and about seeing the sights in all the traffic mayhem sapped the will but a return to the Shemsi revived the soul. Its cool interior felt wonderful; I don't believe in heaven but lying in the pool must come close.  The rooms are quite small but beautiifully decorated in traditional style. Beds are comfortable and plumbing excellent what more could one need? The rooms have air conditioning but it was scarcely needed even in this heat.  The staff were calm and courteous always helpful in giving good advice about places to visit. We ate in several evenings and the food was excellent. This riad serves beer and wine and for the decadent one can smoke on the top terraces.,Date of stay: April 2010,Trip type: Traveled with friends,Norwich,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wensum_10
Riad Shemsi,LKBrown wrote a review Apr 2010,50,Perfect riad in magical Marrakesh!,From the moment we arrived in Marrakesh we were impressed with this riad. We had arranged for a pick up from the airport as we'd read that addresses can be quite hard to find in the medina and I would recommend this as it means you can reach the riad with minimum confusion and hassle. The place is an oasis of calm. It is relaxed and peaceful and because it only has five rooms you never feel like you're tripping over other guests.  We stayed for five nights and a couple of things stood out about this place. One is that the rooms looked exactly like they did on the riad's website (something you don't often find). The other thing is the staff. They really were great: friendly and helpful without being in your face all the time.  The food was also excellent. Fresh juice yoghurt pancakes and bread for breakfast salad or omelette for lunch. We had a home-cooked Moroccan dinner in the riad twice because it was so good the first time.  The location of the riad is slightly away from the main centre but still only a 15-20 minute walk from the main square. It is at the end of an alleyway which at first could seem a bit worrying but you soon realise that all of the medina is like this and you never feel threatened like you might in other cities. We found that we were able to walk to all of Marrakesh's main attractions (although with hindsight I would get a taxi to the Jardin Marjorelle as it was a long dusty walk with lots of busy roads to navigate).  A couple of things that would have been useful to know: most attractions close from around 11am-3pm which is when we found we were ready to head out and see stuff so a couple of times we got out early then came back and relaxed on the roof terrace for the afternoon. The other thing is cash. The 'global cash' shop on Rue de la Kasbah was never open when we were there so we had to hunt round for banks. We found one near Rue de Bab Agnaou which has an ATM outside that can change most currencies but again with hindsight it would have been easier to get some dirham at the airport on arrival.  Marrakesh exceeded our expectations and this riad definitely contributed to our positive experience of the city. It is not a cheap place to stay but it is worth every penny and will help you have a great experience of Marrakesh.,Date of stay: April 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"York, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LKBrown
Riad Shemsi,HappyTravelerFrance wrote a review Apr 2010,50,Beautiful escape,I stayed in Riad Shemsi with two other friends and we could not have been happier with our choice. Not only is the setting beautiful with views of the royal palace from the sun terrace but it is tranquil and hidden in charming backstreets where you can escape the noise and bustle of the main square in Marrakech.    The interior was gorgeous with; modern but tastefully authentic and the swimming pool is great touch and allows you to relax during the heat of the afternoon.    What most stood out for us however was the great hospitality we received from the moment we stepped through the door. The staff really make the Riad so very special and if we are ever in Marrakech again we will not be hesitating to come back!

Thankfully the Riad isn't located in the crazy centre but doesn't need to be as it is only a short 10 minute walk from the main square and is a haven of bliss to walk into after an intense day among the dizzy maddening crowds on the streets!

Riad Shemsi,colin g wrote a review Apr 2010,30,quiet and comfortable-lacked a special touch,"we found this via the web and were attracted by its site-there are stunning pictures of the (6) rooms. we corresponded by email and booked the dearest room (chocolate). we also got a review from a previous visitor via tripadvisor which was good  the riad is small and tucked away in the South part of the old walled city-we liked that as it meant quiet days if you were just lazing in the sun etcand quiet nights too. it was only a short taxi ride to the main square etc for activity. our room was large and comfortable; there was a communal terrace with good beds for relaxing under a gazebo. we ate there first evening and it was ok for the one time. food/drinks during the day were available but limited.there is a plunge pool on ground level which was freezing.  poor points:- the loo seat in our ensuite was coming off and although we reported it on the first day it was not fixed despite promises to do so; the sunbeds on the top roof were in a poor state...that area looked ""tired""; for the money we expected fresh bottled water in the room daily (available but charged); staff were friendly and helpful but it lacked a warm personal feel...no little touches which disappointed us  we stayed 5 nights which was ample to see Marrakesh and the low Atlas mountains  feel the cheaper rooms would have been a better option in retrospect for the money",Date of stay: March 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Chorleywood,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gunyah
Riad Shemsi,jhunterking wrote a review Mar 2010,50,Heavenly haven,"I found this Riad in Alaistair Sawday's ""Special Places to Stay In Morocco"" so of course I was expecting a high standard with no gimmicks.    Having looked at previous reviews on Trip Advisor I found them all to be excellent; and we were not disappointed. We had a tastefully decorated room in a traditional riad of the highest order. The staff were both friendly and discretely helpful. Nothing was too much trouble!    We chose to have dinner in the Riad one evening and were served with a delicious lamb tagine which proved to be the best we had during our stay in Marrakech.    I'm so glad we chose to stay in the more peaceful area of the Royal Kasbah as the wide streets enabled easy access by car unlike other parts of the medina.    To cap it all the panoramic views from the top terrace were simply stunning and included the snow capped Atlas mountains and the Palace.

Riad Shemsi,PaulaCumbria wrote a review Mar 2010,50,A haven of Tranquillity,Riad Shemsi came recommended by friends who stayed there last year and I have to say we enjoyed our visit immensely and shall certainly recommend it to our friends and family.  The Riad is located in the Royal Kasbash a pleasant 15 minute walk to the main square Place Jemma El Fnna. Having explored the Medina from one end to the other I have no doubt that this is probably one of the best areas to stay as the streets are well lit and wider than areas north of the square which are very enclosed and quite clostraphobic. It was alos extremely peaceful especially after returning from the hustle and bustle of the Souks.  The Riad is beautifully decorated and furnished in traditional Moroccan design. All the rooms have air conditioning safes hairdryers bathrobes and complimentary toiletries. The staff are delightful and Lachen the guardian who lives in always had a smile on his face even when we returned at 3 am. Asma the manager although reserved was extremely helpful and gave us a map and lots of useful advice. She also organised a trip to the mountains which was a welcome escape from the madness of Marrakech. We had dinner at the Riad a delicious lamb tagine which was probably the best meal we had during our stay.  Marrakech is great very exciting but full on!

Riad Shemsi,SARich19 wrote a review Mar 2010,50,Memorable Stay,We stayed at Riad Shemsi for four nights in February and apart from the rain we have to say it was a glorious stay.  The riad is pretty traditional and very elegant without being over the top. Night time is very quiet bliss and a good reason to stay in the KASBA rather than Medina. We met some people on an excursion to the mountains who said their riad was close to the centre and noisy at night. We couldn't fault the cleanliness though the pool was a bit cold(but then it is winter. Going to the riad was easy because of the close proximinity of the road and access by taxi. The streets in the Kasba are wide and welcoming. Some of the streets in the centre can be a bit narrow and intimidating especially at night time. We had no problems where we were though.  The staff were delightful and helpful. Nadia Lascen and Asima couldn't have been more helpful. We ate in the riad on the last night and wished we had ate there every night. The beef tangine with prunes is fantastic and the pilaf with lentils were also delicious. We would not hesitate to recommend riad Shemsi to anybody who wants an elegant riad lovely staff and food with no gimics!

Riad Shemsi,Russki wrote a review Mar 2010,50,The Magic of Marrakech,Despite of its growing popularity and prosperity Marrakech is still endlessly magical. We have previously stayed in top large/chain hotels of the city but it’s to Riad Shemsi that we would recommend you should head. It has previously been described as an oasis of calm and tranquillity and I can’t think of a better way to describe it. You’d never think that behind this huge wooden door at the end of a narrow street in the midst of hustle and bustle of the busy medina hides this beautiful Riad.  Riad Shemsi harbours the best Marrakech has to offer – vibrant colour warm and welcoming atmosphere and unique style. The owners have really given a lot of thought to the décor which is a tasteful mix of Moroccan style and modern art. There are plenty of interesting details to keep your eyes busy.  The staff were really friendly and welcoming and couldn’t do enough to help. They’ve given advice on some good local hammams places to visit and restaurants. We tried Tanjia and La Foundouk restaurants both of which served delicious food accompanied by amazing atmosphere. Unfortunately we didn’t have time to try dinner or lunch at the Riad which is on our list of things to do next time we come to Marrakech! However we did have the pleasure of trying breakfast at the Riad which was yummy and included too! I was gutted we missed breakfast on the day we were leaving and had to have boring and overpriced sandwiches at the airport! We were also lucky to have met and shared a drink (or two) with the owner Liz who is a lovely lady and great company.  Riad Shemsi is conveniently located 15-20 minute walk to the square and souks at the heart of this pulsating city. For those who don’t fancy a walk taxies are easily accessible and reasonably priced (as long as you barter!!).  Overall we had a lovely and relaxing stay in Marrakech thanks to Riad Shemsi. It comes highly recommended for anyone who wants to experience this magical city.,Date of stay: March 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Bristol,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Russki

Riad Shemsi,LondonAnouska wrote a review Feb 2010,50,Riad Shemsi a beautiful oasis,Riad Shemsi was a real taste of Marrakech. On arrival the large wooden doors revealed an extremely warm welcome by the waiting staff. We entered a beautiful lounge area by the pool and enjoyed a mint tea while our suitcases were taken to our room (the Chocolate Suite at the top of the Riad.) Chatting to the manager and admiring the tasteful authentic surroundings we gleaned valuable information about all of the interesting things on offer in Marrakech. Recommendations for a local spa and a tour bus around the area were particularly helpful.  The Chocolate Suite is tasteful calm and very comfortable. In the evenings a member of staff thoughtfully lit the fire in our room.  Breakfasts and evening meals were delicious and superbly prepared by two wonderful cooks in a pristine kitchen. We ate in on all but one night because the aroma of the food was so inviting - tagines fresh fish vegetables and spices. Excellent wines were available to compliment the cuisine.  The Rooftop terrace was a perfect place to view the Royal Palace mountains and flocks of storks winging their way across the bustling city.  Marrakech is quite an experience and should not be missed by any serious traveller. You could never be bored and it is a destination which entertains educates and amazes in so many ways.  At the end of a busy day the Riad Shemsi is a wonderfully calm and serene oasis and a perfect retreat to mull over the adventures of the day.  I cannot recommend Riad Shemsi highly enough. It is a little jewel strategically placed to access everything with ease.,Date of stay: January 2010,Trip type: Traveled with friends,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LondonAnouska
Riad Shemsi,TWGARDNER wrote a review Jan 2010,50,Outstanding Service - Tranquil Boutique Hotel,Riad Shemsi is an exceptionally well run Riad were nothing was ever too much trouble.    The hotel is tucked away down a quiet street away from all the hustle and bustle. On arrival at the hotel (close to midnight) Hassan greeted us with a refreshing mint tea while our bags were taken to our room.    We stayed in the Orange room which was big enough for our 3 night stay. It was a typical Moroccan styled room with great fittings powerful shower with loads of warm water. Toiletries including cotton buds shower gels shampoo decent big towels quality towel dressing gowns etc were all provided and the room was really quiet at night time too. (which was really important after a hectic day. The only criticism would be that the bed was a little hard.    Breakfasts were really good and super tasty! We had to leave at 4:45AM and Hassan went to the trouble of making us breakfast at this earlier hour - you can't ask for more than that.    Paul the owner recommended we visit Tanjia - what a fantastic recommendation. The monk fish is among the best I have had and the setting superb!    The roof terrace is a fantastic place to chill out and the communal areas are so spacious. We effectively felt like we had the entire place to ourselves.    To summarise I would recommend this Riad to others looking for a quality place to stay in Marrakech. In my opinion it beats the 5* hotel chains and is a great base for a Moroccan adventure!,Date of stay: January 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TWGARDNER

We originally booked the accommodation for three nights only to include New Years Eve and booked a large hotel outside the city for the remainder of our trip.    We found the accommodation to be so good and the staff to be so helpful and pleasant that we cancelled our hotel and extended our stay at the Riad for the week.    It is superb value for money whatever we asked for it was never a problem the staff are amazingly courteous and the cooking is fantastic.    The effort they made on New Years Eve was superb – on one occasion I complained that the pillows were to hard and the following day the Manager went out and bought a more comfortable pillow – you cannot ask for better than that.

The roof terrace is beautiful & the pool looked great although a little small.

Riad Shemsi,RichardJN wrote a review Dec 2009,30,"Good, but would recommend elsewhere",Our recent trip to Marrakech was one of mixed feelings by the time of our departure. We arrived to the Riad and were welcomed by a gentleman & shown to the room. Our room like the whole Riad was beautiful. It was frequently a welcome break from the madness of the city streets & market sellers.    Our greatest disappointment was with the lack of assistance from the daily manager who seemed disinterested in us & when asked for a restaurant suggestion on our first night sent us to an extortionate nightclub/restaurant with a menu furthest from the Moroccan cuisine we were looking for.    Another frustration with this Riad was an insistence on quoting everything in Euro rather than the local currency making things significantly more expensive. When we asked for suggestions of activities we were met with exasperation typical followed by quotes for activities at exorbitant rates. Indeed we felt everyone in Marrakech saw tourists as a large cash cow who could be tapped for as much as they could get.    The staff in this Riad who prepared us breakfast and tended to our room were absolutely wonderful & the man who greeted us daily at the door was an absolute gentleman and appeared to never have a day off. The location of this Riad was excellent with only 15 minutes to the main square. Overall though I suspect there are better Riads around particular for the price & perhaps for some local knowledge/advice.,Date of stay: November 2009,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Bangor, Co.Down",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RichardJN

Riad Shemsi,alisongiles wrote a review Oct 2009,50,"Truly welcoming staff, elegant interior and an absolutely perfect retreat",As three young female professionals travelling to Marrakech for the first time Riad Shemsi was an absolutely perfect retreat. The staff warmly welcomed us from the second we got there booked safe reliable taxis on our behalf provided invaluable tips and advice about local restaurants culture and sights and really treated us as part of the family. They couldn't have done anything more to help us and we were sorry to say goodbye. The other guests mostly couples were a pleasure to stay with and while the odd story was shared over breakfast or in passing we hardly noticed anyone else staying there at all. I would most certainly recommend it to any couples friends or single travellers looking for somewhere to relax after the hussle and bussle of the streets and markets.    The Riad has previously been described as tranquil and elegant and I can't think of a better way to describe it. The decor is beautiful and effortlessly tasteful the pool is extremely inviting and the gorgeous sun terrace looks over the roof tops of Marrakech towards the Kings palace where you can watch the storks fly over in the evening. The rooms were perfect in size had excellent features a warming Moroccan theme excellent showers and beautiful artifacts.    Location wise it's a 10minute walk through the crazy streets to the central square and only 5 mins from Les Bains Marrakech. We felt safe walking back at night and as though we were in an ideal location for all activities.    The service from the staff is excellent and I haven't stopped talking about the breakfasts delicious salads and most fantastic lamb tagine I have ever tried! The owner Liz is absolutely fantastic at mixing favourite english recipes with the local foods and ingredients and I can honestly say we had the best meal of the holiday in Riad Shemsi! Delightful!    I have no hesitation in reccommending this Riad to anyone staying in Marrakech and we certainly hope to return one day soon!

The rooms are lovely the roof terrace provides ample opportunity for sunbathing and the little pool can be a welcome relief from the heat. Make sure you eat dinner at least once here too - the meal we had there was definitely one of the nicest we had in Marrakesh and among the best value. The riad is at the bottom end of the Medina so it's a little walk to get to the centre of the city but this does mean you get a real feel for the place.

We could not have been more delighted with our experience at the riad it is an absolutely beautiful place to stay and we highly recommend it.    The riad itself is gorgeously appointed with morrocan furnishings when the big doors are first opened to welcome you you are invited into a beautiful pool and seating area to sip sweet mint tea and then graciously taken to your room. The second level of the riad has a dining area and an inviting little sitting room with a fireplace which we assumed might be used in colder times of the year. There are two terrace areas one with a tented lounge and additional tables and a top level with views over the kasbah and Marrakech and the Atlas Mountains with lots of comfortable loungers for reading books etc. Everything you need!    We chose a pretty basic room and the room was lovely tastefully decorated with a very pretty en-suite shower. Comfortable beds! Who-ever was in charge of decorating the riad did a really great job!!!    We had no complaints with service. Asma in the office was very helpful and speaks good english. Our extremely basic french wasn't a problem with the rest of the staff who went out of their way to try and understand what we were asking of them and to help us. The location in the kasbah was easy to find after the first day and we really enjoyed our walks from the riad to the main square and souks every day. Everybody was very friendly to us and we didnt feel hassled at all.    We fell in love with Marrakech and I feel that this was in no small way a part of where we stayed for the duration of our trip we were really made very welcome and I thank everyone at Riad Shemsi for that.

It's beautifully decorated and kept spotlessly clean with a pool to cool down in and a great range of refreshments but it's the staff that really make it such a great place to stay. Whether it was suggesting a restaurant booking a cab organising a trip to the mountains or rustling up a snack at a moment's notice nothing was too much for them.

Riad Shemsi,chateausaunders wrote a review May 2009,50,AN ENCHANTING PLACE TO STAY - AND WORTH EVERY DIRHAM!,I really wanted to write an original and insightful review of Riad Shemsi. But alas all I can do is endorse the positive reviews of all those other guests. Yes: the room was cool and comfortable. (And funky!) Yes: the breakfasts were delicious. (And included!) Yes: the pool was refreshing. Yes: the view from the roof terrace was entrancing. And no: nothing really was too much for Nadia and her amazingly friendly staff. Riad Shemsi is indeed a welcome oasis in this hot vibrant town. I suspect that for my wife and myself Marrakech will remain a magical once-in-a-lifetime experience.

Riad Shemsi,TravellingVirginian wrote a review Apr 2009,50,Outstanding Customer Service,As a Customer Service trainer I know outstanding service when I see it - and the staff at Riad Shemsi had it down to a science. From arranging the cab to the hotel (good idea for those not quite ready to jump into bargaining a price) the mint tea and snacks upon arrival to the gorgeous breakfasts and amazingly helpful personal tips on shopping and dining - it was exactly what I needed as a first-timer in this mad city. Nadia made sure we were well prepared to brave the streets and souks on our own. They even arranged a day trip to the Atlas Mountains for us all seamless.  Thank you so much to all the staff at Riad Shemsi.

Riad Shemsi,EdinburghJack wrote a review Apr 2009,50,A unique experience,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in the Riad Shemsi with its elegant interior architecture and our lovely room. The staff was always cordial and very helpful. Ihsan the resident staff member and his small team provided us with breakfast each morning sweet mint tea on request anytime during the day and optional dinner (good but a bit pricy). Sarah (the administrator) and/or her assistant Nadia were very helpful and at hand to attend to our queries and provide relevant advice.    The Riad was in prime location in the old town enabling us to walk each day to most places of interest and back. It was such a welcoming feeling to re-enter the sanctuary of the Riad each afternoon leaving the hustle and bustle of the old town behind and settling down for a well deserved rest either sunbathing on the roof or reading a book in the cool shade. Then it was out again to the Jamea fen Square in the evening to watch the lively performers marvel at the biggest makeshift ""restaurants"" in the world or visit the many surrounding souks!    Sarah organised a driver to take us to the Atlas Mountains one day. The 6 hour return trip at 80 pounds sterling was good value for money. However on the way back we stopped for lunch at a hotel owned by Sir Richard Branson. While the location was superb with marvelous views of the valley lunch for two was extortionate (67 pounds for a slim starter and main course of very standard club sandwich or vegetable dish plus a couple of bottles of beer - no third course!). Our advice is by all means visit the hotel but just for a drink and have lunch instead at a restaurant further up the mountain in one of its local resorts.    All in all we had six lovely days and would strongly recommend a stay n the Riad Shemsi    Hagop and Kathleen Edinburgh",Date of stay: March 2009,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Edinburgh,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EdinburghJack
Riad Shemsi,Saskia07 wrote a review Apr 2009,50,Brilliant Marrakesh,I agree with the other reviews so am not going to repeat. All the staff were excellent at Riad Shemsi very welcoming and friendly. It was an oasis after the hub bub of the streets and the roof provides a secluded spot for rest and a spot of sunbathing. Marrakesh is certainly worth a visit.    Location is about one mile from the main square through the Kasbah and gives an opportunity to see where the residents live. One enterprising boy guided us the last 50 metres to our front door and then held out his hand for us to pay - but no luck for him we were not lost!    The cost of the accommodation is in Euro's so not favourable at the moment for the British but when sterling recovers will be extremely good value.    One recommendation for the first time Morrocan traveller - remember to agree the price for everything before you accept drinks taxis etc. otherwise you will pay over the odds.    If you want great bargains this is not necessarily the place for you as the leather is good quality and authentic jewellrey in silver and precious stones is not inexpensive. You quickly know when you have offered too little as the store keepers will turn away. Do go up to the top of the souk and down all the little alleyways as this is where you will find people working on leather and weaving etc.    If you do want a European cafe lunch head for Bougainvillea by the Mosque Mouassine. When you come out turn left and go up into the area where they dye all the cotton but beware of men carrying hot dyed cotton on staves across their shoulders. Health & Safety would have a field day when you see where they do the dying you will know what I mean!!

Riad Shemsi,highbank wrote a review Mar 2009,50,tranquil hideaway,We chose Riad Shemsi after reading the excellent reviews and because it is in the Medina. It really is a lovely peaceful place to return to after a day sightseeing in the bustling streets of Marrakech.  The Riad is traditional with a beautiful courtyard and pool where you can sit with a mint tea or beer if you prefer. On the roof terraces there's a shady area to sit or sun loungers if you want to catch some sun.  The staff are extremely welcoming and we were given a map and advice about where to visit soon after we arrived. The manager Sarah was very informative and nothing seemed too much trouble. We booked a trip into the Atlas Mountains taxis and a restaurant through the Riad.  We stayed in the cheaper rooms which were nicley finished with small but adequate bathrooms.  Breakfast was freshly prepared whenever you were ready and included fresh orange  juice pancakes fruit yoghourt and bread with jams. - all very nice. We noticed on the website that croissants and pastries were mentioned but those weren't on offer whilst we were there.  I would certainly recommend Riad Shemsi as a great place to stay in Marrakech.,Date of stay: March 2009,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Marlow, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/highbank
Riad Shemsi,Broj wrote a review Mar 2009,50,An absolute oasis,We stayed at Riad Shemsi last August for 3 nights but it was so relaxing it felt like we were there for a week. Marrakech was a fantastic place to visit but wandering around the walled city is not exactly cruisy. Luckily we had the Riad to come back to which is an absolute haven.  We had booked to eat at the Riad for the first night of our stay. There was a mix up and it turned out this hadn't been booked with the chefs but in no time our dinner was accommodated AND the food was lovely.  We asked to keep 2 bottles of champagne in their fridge which was absolutely fine with the Riad. When we asked for the champagne it was bought to us in a silver ice bucket along with champagne flutes and some nibbles. Very thoughtful.  We stayed in the Chocolate Suite and it happened that for our last 2 nights we were the only people staying in the Riad which was even more fabulous. Given that I'm sure that a stay there any time would be wonderful. I hope to be returning there very soon!,Date of stay: August 2008,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Broj
Riad Shemsi,KateLouie wrote a review Mar 2009,50,The perfect foil for an exotic experience,This Riad was highly recommended to me by some friends as the perfect haven from a bustling city. The whole stay from the transfer from the airport to the check out was organised smoothly & with a smile. We stayed in the Cannelle room which was truly lovely. The room was very well appointed with attention to details. The staff could not do enough to make the stay special and the decor of the riad made me feel that I really had entered a world of its own. The common areas are fabulous: I recommend the pool area and the roof terrace. Nadia arranged for us to experience the hammam and that was wonderful.

Riad Shemsi,SRMCD wrote a review Jan 2009,50,Memorable Stay,A truly memorable stay in an elegant and sophisticated riad.  The service was very friendly thanks to a very professional owner (Mrs Liz Shadarevian) supervising an attentive but unobtrusive staff. The owners are very knowledgeable about Marrakech and its surrounding the local practices and are full of practical advice.  The food was wonderful the view from the roof terrace is breathtaking (although your presence at night will attract the attention of the royal palace guards and their resulting flurry of activity will prove quite amusing). I had the privilege of being guided through the soukh by the owner and this presented the great advantages of seeing sights which would have remained otherwise undiscovered and that of avoiding mercantile tourist traps.  We came back revived - better than a spa!!!,Date of stay: September 2008,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SRMCD
Riad Shemsi,A Tripadvisor Member wrote a review Dec 2008,40,Great Place to Stay,A friend and I stayed at Riad Shemsi at the end of November and would thoroughly recommend anyone to stay here from couples wanting a romantic getaway to girlfriends on a shopping spree. From the moment we arrived we were made to feel extremely welcome. Nadia helped us get our bearings and suggested restaurants and point of interest we should visit - all done over a cup of delicious mint tea. However I have to say that I don't think we used the same route to the main square each time we walked there - no fault of Nadia’s though! The Riad is extremely clean and has some lovely touches such as rose petals scattered on the bed and lovely soft bathrobes. Due to a long day travelling we decided it was easier to have our evening meal at the Riad - a wonderful lamb tagine and an aubergine starter to die for. Sadly the weather was to not too good so we did not make use of the pool and sun terrace but there is always a next time....! I don’t think anyone who stayed at Riad Shemsi would be disappointed.

Riad Shemsi,whatithinkofthis wrote a review Dec 2008,50,Peaceful location with great service,I agree with all the other positive comments made. We spent three nights at Shemsi and thoroughly enjoyed the riad and thought it was good value for money relative to other riads. Set in the royal district of the medina Shemsi is a 15min stroll from the main square which adds to its authenticity - how many people want to live next to a tourist attraction like the main square? The walking distance makes it feel like you're staying in someone's home and ensures that you see more than just souks.    Though it rained every day and I'm not a big fan of Marrakech (despite the cultural difference being interesting the smell of fumes and volume of people in enclosed spaces doesn't do it for me) the riad provided a peaceful retreat to get away from the intensity of the city. The food was great (not cheap but reasonably priced I thought) and service was attentive without being intrusive. The owner was at the riad during our stay and is clearly passionate about the riad and ensuring that everything is just right for guests.,Date of stay: December 2008,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Woldingham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/whatithinkofthis
Riad Shemsi,David_W_Alexander wrote a review Nov 2008,40,A Moroccan delight,For those of you who want a pristine chocolate box location Marrakech is not the place to stay.  For those of you who want to see a completely different culture first hand even when it’s no more than a stone’s throw away from Spain Marrakech is a fantastic experience.  As someone who travels extensively – and this year I have stayed in two dozen countries on business and pleasure – I knew what to expect from Morocco and it was somewhere I have waited to see for many years.  I paid a bit more than I’d originally planned on my accommodation in Marrakech because I wanted it to make it truly special for my girlfriend and I.  The Riad Shemsi mostly lives up to the hype - the bedrooms and communal areas have been lovingly decorated by owner Elizabeth with elegant local touches such as silver water bottle cases and hand-carved wooden tissue boxes.  Elizabeth clearly takes great pride in her Riad and the setting away from the main hubbub but within the medina walls is perfect for getting some respite from the noise and chaos.  We ate in the Riad on our first night. The food was fabulous lovingly prepared and well worth the praise others have given it but slightly pricey despite its high quality.  Elizabeth and her staff were happy to organise a massage for my girlfriend and book restaurants for us before we discsovered the Square and its delights.  The views from the top terrace are fantastic and the whole place is a clean and quiet haven from the circus which is Marrakech.  We spent a lot of time out of the Riad enjoying the mazy streets the museums the Souks and the main Square which is an anarchic crazy place full of huge characters demanding entertainers and at night fabulous food stalls.  Mindful of hygiene standards for street food around the world especially in a country which has some way to develop we ate in the square initially with trepidation. Each night for our final three nights we ate at different stalls enjoying fantastic prawns calamari chicken and beef couscous and vegetables accompanied by great bread and chilli sauce.  We arranged a trip to the Atlas Mountains through the Riad and had a fabulous time and it was good to have a day seeing the scenery and visiting the amazing Sir Richard Branson retreat on the way back.  Sitting in the petit but perfectly formed and heated Riad pool on my final afternoon I felt pretty contented and it really does feel like a fabulous spa. Apparently you can rent the whole thing for up to 15 people - which seems like a very good idea indeed.,Date of stay: November 2008,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Broxbourne, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/David_W_Alexander
Riad Shemsi,gregorylives wrote a review Nov 2008,40,Haven in Marrakech,I can honestly say that this was one on the most enjoyable stays I have had in recent times.    Sure the Riad is both very comfortable and well decorated but it's the hospitality that makes Riad Shemsi stand out. The owners and staff are all committed to ensuring that all guest have a fantastic time in Marrakech.    The simple continental breakfast is both perfectly adequate and enjoyable for the surroundings. Dinner was great and I would recommend having at least one meal at Riad Shemsi.    On a number of occasions we watched the Moroccan sun set while enjoying a bottle of wine on the roof terrace.... magic.    It is not the most lavishly expensive Riad in town but I think you would struggle find accommodation as comfortable and as hospitable as this.

Riad Shemsi,andyev wrote a review Nov 2008,50,Fantastic Time,We stayed at this Riad for three nights and booked it via hipmarrakech.com.    It was a fantastic experience staying here. From the moment we arrived we were warmly welcomed by the owners and their staff. The Riad is very comfortable and ideally positioned for many of the surrounding attractions. In fact if you want to experience living amongst the locals then this Riad is the perfect setting for this. Nardia booked us a day trip to the Atlas Mountains with Hassan our taxi driver for the day who was very friendly and quite reasonably priced. Although the walk to the main square was around 15 minutes it took us through streets occupied by the locals and at no time did we feel unsafe as everyone was friendly and willing to help.    The Riad has a fab roof terrace that has views of the Atlas Mountains and the Palace. The Riad is an ideal place to chill out and to have that extra special personal touch. We stayed at a hotel for four days prior to Riad Shemsi and if we had a choice again we would most certainly choose the Riad and not the hotel for our stay.    It was so good to sit beside a log fire in the evening and chat to other residents and have the occassional game of draughts or chess before sitting down to an excellent Morrocan dinner served by the riad staff.    Having stayed at many places around the world we would put our stay at this riad as one of our favourites.,Date of stay: November 2008,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Wales,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andyev
Riad Shemsi,Sam liddle wrote a review Nov 2008,50,Rock the Kasbah,We've just returned from 3 days in Marrakech staying at Riad Shemsi. The Riad organised for us to be collected at the airport and after a trip of only 20 minutes we were being offered welcome drinks at the riad by Nadia who could not have been more friendly helping us orientate ourselves. All the staff at the riad were wonderful as was our room the orange mini-suite which was very comfortable and had the ambience we'd hoped for from a Marrakesh Riad. The swimming pool in the courtyard and the peaceful roof terrace with terrific views of the city and the mountains beyond made the riad feel much bigger than the six bedrooms suggested. We didn't eat lunch or dinner at the riad but the aromas from the kitchen each evening made us wish that we had. For a short stay we couldn't recommend Riad Shemsi more highly; it is a perfect peaceful friendly and relaxing place to return to after a hard day's haggling in the souks and located in the Kasbah is a short walk from everywhere you'll want to go in Marrakech.,Date of stay: November 2008,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,oxford,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Liddlesam

Riad Shemsi,robsim wrote a review Nov 2008,50,An unbelievable experience,Spoit for choose with so many riads in Marrakech we finally decided on Riad Shemshi after reading its reviews on trip advisor. It was brilliant. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff. They were charming and their advice on where to go what to avoid and their help in arranging guides taxis and a trip to the atlas mountains could not have been bettered. We had dinner in the Riad on our first night and it was probably the best meal we had in Marrekech. Breakfast was equally as good. Our room the Chocolate suite was delightful and even though we woken each morning at 5.30 by the immans calling the faithful to prayer this just made us feel we were immersed in the place. The Riad is located at the southern end of the medina a 20 minute walk from the Djemaa El-Fna but this added to the experience of Marrekach. The walk to the central area takes you through a working and living district so you dont just get to see the tourist bits.

Riad Shemsi,UkBumblebee wrote a review Oct 2008,50,A wonderful and authentic riad,What a discovery! The Riad Shemsi is a beautiful riad set amist the bustling Kasbah within the walls of the medina and was perfect for a girls weekend break. After months of research we decided to book the Shemsi based on the reviews on trip advisor and the photographs on Riad Shemsi's website. I was a little concerned at first as most of the reviews seemed to be good to be true but I can say with hand on heart that the Riad Shemsi was everything the website and the reviews said it was. Sarah Nadia and the staff were absolutely wonderful and looked after us so well. Every need was met with a smile and we really valued the information we were given on arrival the maps of the city and advice regarding prices we should expect to pay for taxi's etc especially as we were a group of females visiting Marrakech. The rooms were beautiful and traditionally decorated the courtyard with the pool an area of serenity and we enjoyed many hours subathing on the roof terrace overlooking the rooftops of the medina. We ate evening meals and lunch twice in the Shemsi. The food was freshly bought and cooked to perfection.  The riad was perfectly positioned and was in walking distance of the main square and the souks. We were so glad we decided to stay within the city walls rather than the new part as we feel we really experienced the real Marrakech. As female travellers we surprisingly felt very safe ( we did ensure we wore long trousers and kept our shoulders and upper arms covered). The only real danger was from the crazy drivers and in particular the millions of mopeds in amongst the horse drawn carriages carts and donkeys. There seemed to be no rules and it appeared to be a free for all!!  Shopping in the souks was fantastic (heaven for a shopaholic like myself) and we had really got to grips with haggling with the shopkeepers and taxi drivers before we left.  We also spent a wonderful afternoon at the Bains de Marrakech enjoying the hammam and massage.  To conclude Marrakech and the Riad Shemis were both fantastic and we can't wait to return.,Date of stay: October 2008,Trip type: Traveled with friends,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UkBumblebee
Riad Shemsi,Nottingham1972 wrote a review Oct 2008,50,Excellent accommodation for 5 women!,I would like to thank Sarah Nadia and the team for a fantastic stay at Riad Shemsi.  We were unsure of what to expect because we have always stayed in large hotels. However this was much more personal and felt so pampered.  The Riad is so beautiful with every detail so perfect – even the staff!  I have to thank Lessen for always having a smile on his face even when he brought us breakfast at 4:30am!  Everyone is so friendly and cannot do enough for you it was a joy to come back to the Riad every day knowing we'd be greeted with a smile.  There is just one comment – I would like to suggest that a curtain / wooden door replaces the glass one to the bathroom in the Chocolate Suite…….. you can see everything that the other person is doing in there!  However that certainly did not spoil our stay with you & would thoroughly recommend the Riad to other friends visiting Marrakech.

Riad Shemsi,owenant wrote a review Oct 2008,40,Perfect apart from water problem,Riad Shemsi was the first place we stayed in Morocco and it was the perfect place to land. Bustling through the Kasbah can be a bit of a sensory overload so to step into the tranquility of this beautifully decorated riad was wonderful. You could not fault the staff who were helpful and informative even providing advice for our onward journey as well as some tips and orientation around Marrakech. The facilities and rooms were lovely. We were unfortunate in that for one of the nights the water was off due to some floods in the Marrakech area (mentioned in another review on this site) which was the only thing that prevents this riad getting full marks. That said they paid for us to go for a hammam by way of apology which seemed to us an appropriate response. Would definitely recomend Shemsi as a place to stay.,Date of stay: October 2008,,Sheffield,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/owenant
Riad Shemsi,Tastydogs wrote a review Oct 2008,30,Water Water everywhere- but not a drop to flush or wash!,Lets be clear. Sometimes things go wrong & the hotel simply can't be blamed. In that case you have to review the hotel based on how the problem is handled..... Can you see whats coming?    Flooding had caused problems at the city reservoir with the result that this riyad in the old town had no water for the 3 days I stayed there. On checking in we were given a really full & friendly run down of Marrakech & shown to our rooms with the bags taken up immediately. It was perhaps a bit disingenuous not to mention the water problem at this point . Every evening there were mutterings about how the water would definitely be on overnight & in the unlikely situation that it was not then a visit to a hammam would be arranged. On each morning there was still no water & no further mention of the expedition but bottled water was available for washing & loos.    At the end the good thing was that the bill was reduced without argument which was a good gesture because the riyads costs were not any less. I do think the riyad should have been a bity more upfront in saying there was a problem & not trying to pretend that the entire city (as opposed to the few blocks nearby) was dry or that the riyad knew the water would be back imminently    The riyad was very attractive with berber fittings all over- every room had a splendid lampshade & ornate (if dry) washbasins. The roof terrace was attractive & on the first night a tasty dinner was served on the roof terrace which was priced reasonably. There is a small but attractive pool in the centre courtyard though on 1 afternoon another party at the riyad encouraged the staff to play rather loud & incongruous arab pop music- a bit at odds with the serenity of the riyad atmosphere. Continental breakfast was very nice but served on the 1st floor was close to a couple of the rooms so early risers might disturb the ne'er do wells who like to lie in    Overall its a good riyad in the far south of the walled medina. Some might say that the website slighly oversells itself- the rooms were adequate rather than spacious & the walk to the main square was closer to 30 minutes rather 10-15 minutes (an interesting walk through a working district).    Friendly staff (an expat English lady & a charming office manageress plus a couple of smiling locals with more limited English). The riyad kindly organised a cheap taxi into the Atlas which saved money on an existing quote from somewhere else    Overall therefore for me the riyad was more of a travel adventure than a truly relaxing oasis of calm but this was due to circumstances beyond the riyad's control . My advice to this comfortable & quirky riyad would be to stay friendly but perhaps not risk overpromising which risks disappointment. That said I think (especially outside weekends) that the market for riyad accomodation is competitive so it would be churlish not to see that the riyad needs to advertise itself with best foot forward    I hope I have not been too churlish in this review of a riyad that is at base quite comfortable enough & deserves to prosper in what I suspect is a competitive market.,Date of stay: October 2008,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Brighton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tastydogs

Riad Shemsi,topicUk wrote a review Oct 2008,50,"Fabulous Accommodation, Welcome and Food",I have just returned from a truly memorable stay in Marrakech. The welcome we received from the staff at Riad Shemsi  was warm and extremely efficient. The food and wine was excellent and every aspect of the service was first class. The Riad is elegantly furnished and very comfortable. We were provided with airport transport maps relevant contact numbers and tips for negotiating the Souks. Nothing was too much trouble and I do hope I can return again very soon. I highly recommend a stay here.,Date of stay: October 2008,Trip type: Traveled with friends,uk,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/topicUk
Riad Shemsi,Sarahadorset wrote a review Sep 2008,50,Fantastic stay at the Riad Shemsi,The Riad Shemsi is a charming jewel in Marrakech. I was one of a party of 5 staying at the Riad. From collecting us all at the airport to recommending and booking restaurants and taxi's the whole experience was made so much easier for us. Nadia and her staff made us all feel very welcome. The rooms were clean the food excellent breakfast is included but we also had lunch and an evening meal there too - everything was home made and the service fantastic.There was the option of eating on the terrace or in the dining area. There is also a sunbathing area at the top of the Riad as well as the pool on the ground floor.The staff were also happy to show us the other suites (Orange and Chocolate). I would truely recommend this as somewhere to stay. I look forward to returning to Marrakech and the Riad Shemsi in the future.,Date of stay: August 2008,,Dorset,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sarahadorset

Nadia is a star!! she went out of her way to ensure we all had a great time.. and all the staff just make you feel so welcome and at home. The location is great a short walk to the souks or 5 mins in a taxi. Make sure you eat at the Raid Shemsi too we had our best meal of the holiday there and the breakfast is pretty good too ! All in all we had an amazing time - so good we have already booked to go back to the Raid Shemsi in Nov 08. I honestly would recommend this Raid to everyone you can't fail to have a great time there !    Try to get to the Atlas mountains for a day it's well worth the trip take a guide to walk you through the berber villages and see the waterfalls - beautiful.

Riad Shemsi,CaroleMc wrote a review Aug 2008,50,"""Just perfect!""",5th August 2008 Queensland Australia    First real opportunity for this review as we have travelled extensively this year.    Husband and I stay at Riad Shemsi for a week in April this year absolutley enjoying our stay in this lovely tranquil haven even though it fairly bustled outside the walls of the riad.    The location is great within walking distance of many attractions including the amazing Djemaa el-Fna with some excellent restaurants close by.    Nadia and the other staff members could not do enough to ensure our stay was memorable. Nothing was too much trouble.    The driver Hassan recommended by Nadia was tops. The riad is exactly as the website depicts - just lovely with a very warm friendly atmosphere. We had the Chanelle Room right outside the pool - great.  The food is excellent starting with the homemade yoghurt jams etc for breakfast and ending with a wonderful dinner. We ate dinner in quite a few nights due to the superior food.    As well as exploring Marrakesh we took day trips with Hassan to the Atlas Mountains and down to seaside Essaouira.    We are reasonably fussy and well travelled with Riad Shemsi fulfulling all requirements for a unforgetable holiday in Morocco.

Riad Shemsi,MurrayScotland wrote a review Jul 2008,50,An oasis of calm,We have just returned from a 5 night stay at Riad Shemsi. Having never been to Marrakech before it was thrilling on the taxi ride to the riad as the roads became smaller and smaller until the taxi could go no farther. We collected our bags and made the 2 minute walk through the small alleys leading to Riad Shemsi. On arrival the door was opened and we were met by Nadia and as she led us inside our jaws dropped....from the old streets of the Medina you enter paradise we were stunned delighted and excited....I could go on but you get the picture. The Riad is beautiful in it's design and decor and spotlessly clean....we were smitten and decided then that we hade made a good choice. We had booked the Chocolate Suite and again were delighted with our choice. No picture can do this Riad justice...the pictures look great but you can't put across the utter relaxation that you feel when you walk through those doors from the heat and bustling life of the Medina into the oasis of calm that is the Riad Shemsi.    The Riad is located in the south of the Medina and is 20 minute walk to Jemaa El Fna and the souks but don't be put off by this. We discovered that this was a bonus as we got to see the less touristy areas and the real life of the Medina as we strolled through the area.    We had our evening meal in the Riad on a couple of evenings and the food is excellent. The breakfasts were just perfect to set us up for the days sightseeing.    Nadia and the staff are excellent and nothing is too much trouble you could not wish for better service.    Don't miss out an opportunity and visit Riad Shemsi we will most certainly be back.,Date of stay: July 2008,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Scotland,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MurrayScotland
Riad Shemsi,EOK wrote a review Jul 2008,50,Loved Riad Shemsi,Hidden away in the Old City like a timeless oyster’s pearl this Riad did not fail to deliver on its mixture of clean modern tranquility and the traditional detail in its architecture and décor with each room telling its own wonderful story.    The hospitality of the staff is second to none even managing service with a smile after rustling up some food at the ungodly hour we arrived!    The Riad is an easy walk to the central square Place Jemaa El Fna and benefits from a lovely shallow pool to cool down in on a lazy afternoon. It also provides delicious and authentic Moroccan cuisine on its extensive menu which can be eaten on the roof terrace which has mesmerizing views over the city.    I have and continue to recommend a visit Marrakech at least once in a lifetime but without a doubt the best thing about Marrakech - Riad Shemsi.,Date of stay: June 2008,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oforikea
Riad Shemsi,WendySurrey_England wrote a review Jun 2008,50,Pure Sanctuary,Just returned from a weeks stay in the spacious Chocolat Suite at the Raid Shemsi and truly loved it.  It was our first visit to Marrakech. Upon arrival we found it a real culture shock and it took us a couple of days to adjust to the hustle and bustle.  We were hassled quite a bit by people wanting to be your guide or take you to spice shops etc. This irritated my husband more than me.  I think you just need to relax about it it's all part of the experience they're only trying to make a quick buck (Dirham!). We were hassled less towards the end of the week  maybe because you walk with confidence and look like you know where you're going even if you don't!  Going back to the Riad was a real escapism. From the outside all you see is a huge studded door at the end of alley. When you ring the bell the door slowly opens and you're greeted with the warmest smile and made to feel so welcome as you enter you're transported to a haven of peace and serenity.  The Riad is about a 15 min walk from the main square it was nice being a little bit away from the chaos and nice being near the Royal Palace and the Saadian Tombs.    Thanks to Nadia for recommending and reserving us tables and the following restaurants they were all fantastic and would highly recommend them (a table on the terrace is a must at all of them)  Le Fondouk...Great Moroccan food (peaceful and romantic setting. Led from restaurant to taxi by porter carrying lantern was great!)  Tangia..........Contemporary Moroccan (cooling mist sprays and fab chicken lemon and olive tagine)  Cafe' Arabe...Modern Moroccan and Italian food (trendy relaxed chill out lounge style)  We also ate at the Riad 3 nights...(beef tagine to die for!)  All the above were similar prices to what you'd pay at home and served alcohol.  It's really good to eat in a restaurant (terrace) over looking the square to watch the sunset and the Square come alive.    Nadia arranged a day trip to the Atlas Mountains for us. We went to Imlil which is more picturesque and less touristy than Ourika. Our driver stayed with us all day and walked us up through a Berber village and stopped for lunch at a Berber house which was a great experience. (take good walking shoes and drinking water) Our driver stopped off at Cooperative Feminine to see local women making Argan oil.  Cost of trip was 800 Dirham's (approx £55 worth it!)    I'd also recommend (Yves Saint Laurent) Majorelle Gardens if you like exotic plants. It was very peaceful and highly recommend lunch here (fantastic salads)  Took a Calache ride (horse drawn carriage) back to the Riad it was good fun and a good way to end a relaxed afternoon (turn right out of gardens to pick up a calache you need to barter for a good price we paid about £9 for both of us which was good they try to charge per person.    All in all I loved Marrakech it was an unforgettable experience with a culture that has great history and a great zest for life. My only regret is that I never tried a hamman which is a good reason to go back to see the friends I made at the Riad Shemsi.    Thank you to Nadia Sarah and the team at Riad Shemsi I can't recommend you enough. It's such a great place to come back to and take a refreshing dip in the pool and to sip on the best ever mint tea. (Thank you Miriam for showing me how to make it!)

Riad Shemsi,saldom06 wrote a review Jun 2008,50,Riad Shemsi - the wonderful haven!,We have just returned from a wonderful trip to Morocco during which we spent three nights at Riad Shemsi. Marrakech is an experience in itself and it was wonderful to know that we could retreat to the haven that is Shemsi. The staff couldn't have been friendlier or more helpful - always smiling and happy to help in any way - from pouring a nice cold beer to recommending and booking a restaurant to arranging a car and driver to escape to the mountains - nothing was too much trouble. The whole place was spotless and the Riad was decorated beautifully. We can certainly recommend Shemsi to anyone planning a visit to Marrakech!

Paradise lies beyond! A cool courtyard with its pool- charming staff who can't do enough for you. Elegant Nadia is always there to help and Sarah (who ought to write a book about her life since she popped into Marrakech for a short holiday six years before) are full of useful information.Even when the taxi drivers are trying to rip you off (quoting 80 DRH for a 30 DRH ride) they're absolutely charming when you object. There aren't any ""no go"" areas and you can wander relaxedly through the twisting streets. It was a sensible idea of Mohammed's to prohibit alcohol ! However you can always have a cool glass of white wine (or anything else you fancy) by the pool or on the roof terrace.

Riad Shemsi,stellbelle wrote a review May 2008,50,A beautiful haven!,This is the first review that I have ever written so that must tell you something as I often visit this site and have never felt so compelled to share my experience.    It was my first time to Marrakech and we were a group of 4 girls in our early thirties. A city like this could be quite daunting for a first time and I found that Nadia did everything to make us feel equiped and at home.    There are only 6 rooms so you do literally feel at times like it is your private house thinking that you have the money to enjoy such a luxury. We had two of the smaller rooms but you won't be disappointed..    The food is amazing ask them to prepare you an evening meal or even a lunch and you won't be sorry we enjoyed two lovely meal that I have told everyone about.    My tips for places to go are Le Comptoir - food amazing belly dancers and amazing location. Bo Zin - a little bit out of town but good for total indulgence. Les Bains de Marrakech - had the Hamman stone massage and full body massage plus manicure all for £85..! I didn't overly rate le Fondouk as we were out on the terrace and it was cold.. The 5 star near the Riad is good for lunch (sorry can't remember name but Nadia will tell you)    All in all put this at the top of your list and you won't be sorry,Date of stay: May 2008,Trip type: Traveled with friends,Warrington,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stellbelle

Riad Shemsi,Rosalind_8 wrote a review Apr 2008,50,A real gem,A really unique experience - it's like staying in a private house. Beautifully decorated very peaceful (no traffic noise which I imagine could be a real problem elsewhere in Marrakech). The staff were terrific very friendly and nothing was too much trouble. We had dinner in the riad twice and enjoyed it . The only downside depending on what you are expecting is that the riad is a good 15-20 minutes walk from the main square along some pretty scruffy streets - but on the other hand you really get the chance to soak up the atmosphere! Also the plumbing is a little erratic (it's a very old building)  and we sometimes ran out of hot water.I can thoroughly recommend Riad Shemsi and would definitely stay there again.,Date of stay: April 2008,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Buckinghamshire,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rosalind_8

The staff are wonderful - very friendly and can't do enough for you.    The room - we stayed in the Chocolate Suite which we can definitely recommend - was gorgeous!

Riad Shemsi,Damaskfan wrote a review Mar 2008,50,Fantastic Riad - Fantastic Staff,My husband and I have just returned from a 5 night stay at the Riad Shemsi and want to go straight back. We stayed in the Chocolate Suite on the top floor and we thought it was absolutely great. You can open up the double doors sit in the morning sunlight and read or just listen to the birds singing. There is a roof terrace where you can stretch out in the sun and a tented area on the next level for those of us who need to stay in the shade. You can eat in the lovely dining room or there is a dining area on the roof.    Breakfast was pancakes yoghurt fruit bread and jams. I believe you could ask for other things but we didn't feel the need. You can have a light lunch prepared and you can order a tasty home cooked 3 course dinner if you wish as long as you let Nadia know before noon.    In the evening the riad is beautifully lit and moroccan music plays and gives the place a great atmosphere. We have been used to large hotels where the guest is fairly anonymous so this was a real change for us. You can get to know the other guests if you want to and share experiences and give each other advice.    Nadia Hassin Marianne and another Nadia are a fantastic team. When you return to the Riad you wander up a narrow alley to a huge wooden door and ring the bell. One of their smiling faces is always there to greet you.    You can have drinks any time of day and they have transformed me into a mint tea fan now. They keep wine to have with your dinner if you would like it. They organised our taxis to and from the airport Nadia will organise trips if you want them and she points out places of interest and makes recommendations and reservations for restaurants.    The Riad is in the heart of the Kasbah and from the roof you can see amongst other things the Royal Palace and the snowy Atlas mountains in the distance. As you can probably tell we think the Riad Shemsi and particularly its staff are wonderful.    Oh and by the way Marrackech is a wonderful city to visit too. Fantastic atmosphere and amazing architecture.,Date of stay: March 2008,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Bristol,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Damaskfan
Riad Shemsi,slimit wrote a review Mar 2008,50,Serenity in a crazy city,Riad Shemsi was a beautiful and welcoming haven after running the gauntlet of the medina. Go through the huge wooden front door and step into peace and quite and a genuine welcoming atmosphere. Nadia and her team work tirelessly to make sure that every guest is looked after during your whole stay nothing is a problem for any of the team. Arrange for dinner in the morning with Nadia and in the evening a home cooked delicious meal is served in stunning surroundings with twinkling candles low lights and soft music piped around the Riad. If is a little cold at night (is was February) Hassin will light the open log fire and coffee or better still a glass of wine can be enjoyed by the flames while you discuss the events of the day. Somebody is always on hand to answer the door to you whatever the time of day or night taxies ordered and directions given to the drivers when they arrive recommendations given for places to visit and restaurant reservations made for you. Breakfast with home-made pancakes yoghurt jams and preserves were served at what ever time you wanted and set you up ready for the task of Souk shopping. We had the chocolate suite and the orange suite both rooms are immaculate the chocolate suite on the roof being the best room in the house was used by my son and he would not move out of it even when I offered him money. Riad Shemsi is so friendly and welcoming that all the guests people who you have never met before all talked and laughed together as if we had all known each other for years. Go on visit this little jewel you will not be disappointed. Liz (the owner) was there at the same time as us and in the future may be thinking about extending to incorporate a Hamman if she does that I may just have to move in with them.

Riad Shemsi,Arjar wrote a review Feb 2008,50,A very good place to stay,This a very pleasant and relaxing place to retreat to from the manic street life of Marrakech. The staff are a particular strength providing excellent advice and service. This part of Marrakech is a little short of places to eat (unless you are brave enough to use a street stall) so it was a 15 minute walk into the centre of the Medina in the evening - which is fine. We stayed in the cheapest room ('Vanille') - which was perfectly adequate - nicely furnished en suite and everything worked. Like many Riad rooms it is internal (I.e. opens onto a communal space and without an outside window) so if you're at all claustrophobic you might ask for a room with a window.

The Riad is magnificent and we have never experienced such incredible service before.From the time we arrived at the Riad we met Nadia who showed us our rooms and were thereafter provided with the traditional mint tea. Miriam Nadia (cook) and Lakshan looked after our every whim. They would drop anything they were doing and deal with us even to the point that they sent someone out to look for Tomato ketchup for our omllette. We had a little problem with our Connelle room and were later upgraded to the Turquoise room with no hesitation. During our stay we met Paul (the owner) who we had a pretty long chat and was a friendly character.  The position of the Riad is ideal as it is only 10-15 mins walk to the main square.  We had dinner on our first night in Marrakech at the Riad. It was a 3 course meal but felt it was slightly on the pricier side (£17 per person)  Overall i would highly recommend this Riad for its excellent staff and service.

This Riad has been tastefully renovated delightful rooms and spot on service.  We stayed in the chocolate suite on the top floor of the Riad with direct access to the lovely terrace. I feel it was worth the extra for the spacious opulent room.    We had a great time in Marrakech and only regret not spening enough time relaxing at the Riad due to cramming in all the experiences of the Souks and the spa treatments. It is a real retreat from the chaos of Marrakech.    We ate on the first night and the food was better than that in one of the recommended restaurants in the medina. It was also very good value.    I would recommend a visit to the Hamman at Bains de Marrakech!,Date of stay: February 2008,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Bristol,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/haddons
Riad Shemsi,elizabennett wrote a review Jan 2008,40,Great place to chill,A lovely riad in the heart of the Kasbah. The location was great; the Medina was walkable approx 10 - 15 minutes depending on how efficient you are in crossing the mad roads ! The Kasbah area was less 'touristy' and manic than the Medina so to come back to the riad after sightseeing was very restful.    The riad itself was beautifully decorated and the room we stayed in was lovely. The highlights for us were:    The terrace - a great view of the city and the Atlas Mountains; it was great catching some December sun.    The breakfast - fresh orange juice and lovely pancakes.    The staff - very friendly and efficient.    We would come back ? Yes ! Riad Shemsi was great and we both fell in love with Marrakech.,Date of stay: December 2007,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Bury St Edmunds, England",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizabennett
Riad Shemsi,abier_london wrote a review Jan 2008,50,Warm Hospitality,We've just returned from Marrakech where we stayed at the Riad Shemsi its staff made us so welcome with their hospitality. They were without exception friendly and very helpful and made a hugh difference to our stay. We were very sad to be leaving and only wish we could have stayed longer.    The Riad itself is 'beautiful' once through the doors you are in a world of your own the gently touches in each area only add to its pleasant atmospher the lighting and decorate are elegantly and tastefully thought of. Its location is excellent and within easy reach to all the sights you would want to visit.

Riad Shemsi,ladyofleisurefromuk wrote a review Jan 2008,50,yalla riad shemsi!,We are staying for 5 nights for our honeymoon and a birthday. . the staff are wonderfully welcoming. Nadia is a lovely warm understated lady who made us feel very welcome along with the owners and also Hassan who always found ways to make our stay that little bit more comfortable. We are staying in the canelle room on the ground floor next to the pool and leaving tomorrow : (. . the riad is beautifully decorated and tres chic. The food at dinner is very fresh and healthily prepared. We were unlucky enough to have stayed when there were 2 days of rain (not a common occurence here in marrakech as i am told!). However on sunny days a spot of sunbathing on the rooftop terrace is perfectly. We hope to return here in June/May when the weather is hotter. The only set back was that the shower in our room tended to be a bit temperamental and the water wasn't hot for very long. . Next time we come we will try out the chocolate suite that we have heard so much about. . highly recommended. .,Date of stay: January 2008,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,london,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ladyofleisurefromuk
Riad Shemsi,nickos68 wrote a review Jan 2008,50,Marrakech Experience,The Riad Shemsi provides a tranquil haven within the Medina of Marrakech. The english owners have produced a first class establishment. There is a roof terrace partly covered with a tent like shading overlooking the central courtyard. Our room the tuquoise room on the first floor was beautifully maintained and decorated and included a morrocan style ensuite with a spacious shower. The dinning area also overlooks the courtyard from the first floor and the decore creates a relaxing and hospitable atmosphere.  We have just spent a week from Boxing Day 2007 until January 2nd 2008. The staff are attentive and helpful at all times and the managers Sarah and Nadia provide advice and insights into the area arrange day trips and taxi's and take bookings to eat at the Riad for dinner. We had New Year dinner there and the meal was outstanding. It was three courses with traditional moroccan starter and a beef tangine for the main with couscous beans and a selection of wines. The desert was locally made icecream and a homemade moroccan style cake. All three courses were cooked to perfection and with the setting made for a throughly enjoyable experience.  I would recommend the Shemsi without hesitation. .,Date of stay: December 2007,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Aussie in London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nickos68

Riad Shemsi,MsIndependance wrote a review Dec 2007,50,Loved Riad Shemsi,We stayed at the Riad Shemsi in Marrakech in great comfort and style. The decor designed by the husband and wife team both of whom have a wonderful eye for colour and style is stunning and very romantic. Each room is designed in a different coloured theme reflecting the very essence and flavour of Morocco.  We were looked after beautifully by the hosts and their utterly charming staff nothing was ever too much trouble for any of them.  During our week long stay we ate supper at the Riad twice as the food was so good and so fresh. It was like staying at a friends house the service was so personal.  We would (and have done so many times) strongly recommend that anyone visiting Marrakech should stay at the Riad Shemsi.,Date of stay: March 2007,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,East Anglia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MsIndependance
Riad Shemsi,ihussain wrote a review Dec 2007,50,A class act,My partner and I stayed for a long weekend at the Riad Shemsi a former pasha's palace in Marrakech. It made our trip very special - we were in the luxurious Chocolat Suite at the top of the riad which was decorated in sumptuous Moroccan fabrics and colours and fittings - tasteful and elegant. A lot of thought and money has been spent getting the rooms right. The staff are incredibly friendly and helpful with lots of ideas for excursions places to eat where to shop - and we were lucky enough to be there when the owner of the riad was in town and were treated very much like family. The riad is wonderfully private as it only has seven rooms spread over three floors. The rooms vary in size with the Chocolat Suite I think being the largest and most swish. The riad is situated slap bang in the old Medina and Kasbah overlooking the royal palace with a terrace on top that has amazing views across the whole of Marrakech including on a clear day good vistas of the Atlas Mountains. We can't recommend the Riad Shemsi highly enough - a real touch of class and luxury in the heart of the frenetic Medina.,Date of stay: December 2007,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ihussain

There had been a leak above the room we had booked so we were given the Chocolate Suite (result!!)and a free 3 course meal with wine.  Thay were so fantasitc and helpful; All the staff were wonderful and we returned after we had travelled around Morocco it was like a home from home.    I cannot find fault with anything.

Riad Shemsi,Maduro_5 wrote a review Nov 2007,50,Tranquility in Marrakech,We rented the whole Riad Shemsi for a long weekend in November 2007 and had an absolutely fantastic stay. This Riad only opened in February this year and when you arrive it is not hard to see why this gem of a place has been getting rave reviews.    The Riad’s interior layout is generous and the décor luxurious without compromising its Moroccan character. The owners Liz & Paul have expended a huge amount of energy making sure the experience you have staying here is a memorable one.    But what also makes this place special are the staff that really go that extra mile. In particular special praise must go to the manageress Nadia who made sure we always had a dinner reservation even when our plans changed at the last minute. Nadia was a wealth of knowledge in planning our entertainment and activities during our stay which included a belly dancer during dinner at the Riad on the first night and organising relaxing massages.    The Riad is situated in the quiet royal Kasbah quarter of the Medina about 15 minutes walk away from the main square and souk and a stones throw from the palace. The main entertainment district near the big hotels and outside of the Medina walls is only five minutes away by taxi.    I look forward to returning again soon and am happy to call this my residence in Marrakech.    I would recommend Riad Shemsi for singles couples groups and families.,Date of stay: November 2007,Trip type: Traveled with friends,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Maduro_5
Riad Shemsi,PerkyHarlow wrote a review Nov 2007,50,Fabulous Riad,My husband and I stayed at Riad Shemsi in October 2007 for 3 nights to celebrate our 1st wedding anniversary and we had a truly fantastic time. This is a beautiful Riad in the Kazbah which is slightly more quieter than other areas of Marrakech. Riad Shemsi has retained its real character and Moroccan charm it has an amazing roof terrace and several spots in the Riad where you can relax in almost total privacy. We were fortunate enough to stay in the Chocolate Room which was truly beautiful and well worth the extra cost.    Whilst we were there we were lucky enough to meet the owners Paul & Liz who couldn’t do enough for us and even went out of their way to purchase some spices for us to take home (Paul I've made the chicken tangine and it was a real hit!) They really went that extra mile to make our stay special. The staff are amazing and thoroughly courteous helpful and attentive (special mention to Nadia Moulet and the team – thank you once again!)  All the staff offered us advice and tips and suggested great places to eat. Recommeded restaurants are Al Fassia & Bo&Zin (best Thai food ever).  In my opinion this is definitely the place to stay in Marrakech and we would definitely recommend it to family and friends.    Liked - The staff quality food location....absolutely everything!

Greeted with mint tea and lots of advice on what to do see and where to eat.  The Riad itself is beautifully decorated furnished and very clean. My boyfriend and I stayed in the Canelle room with doors that swung open on to the courtyard where the plunge pool is.  Breakfast at the riad was an event in itself consisting of fresh squeezed OJ homemade yoghurt fruit croissants and pancakes with honey... really sets you up for the day. We also ate an evening meal at the riad n the 1st night which was fantastic.  Nothing was too much trouble for the staff at the shemsi who were on had for our every request and returning to the riad after a days exploring the crazy busy derbs and souks was an absolute treat.,Date of stay: November 2007,Trip type: Traveled with family,Reading,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wannatravel1
Riad Shemsi,PApaOxon wrote a review Nov 2007,50,calm and relaxation,Riad matched exactly the wonderful photos on the web site and in reality proved to be a most calm and relaxing place in the hustle and bustle that is Marrakech.  The standard of cleanliness was high and the decor tasteful and restful after the vibrant and wonderful sights of souks and Islamic Art. Bathrobes and toiletries added to the relaxation and we were even encouraged to take the pool towels provided to the local hamman instead of hiring them there.  Food was very good and drinks ordered always came with nibbles.  The owner Liz and all her staff were extremely helpful nothing seemed to be too much trouble for any of them. Their advice for restaurants and trips and the organisation of them was excellent and the venues lived up to their descriptions.  Just two very minor details - more hangers for trousers/skirts (turquoise room) and water/glasses daily in room but apart from that - fantastic and would certainly recommend to family and friends and of course stay again!,Date of stay: October 2007,,oxon,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PApaOxon
Riad Shemsi,RubyCheshire wrote a review Nov 2007,50,An oasis of calm in this frenetic city of organised chaos!,Can only endorse the positive comments of other contributors: Liz Paul & their friendly staff really make you feel welcome - more like visiting friends than paying guests. Nothing seems to be too much trouble.    We like to think of ourselves as broad-minded & worldly-wise but a first visit anywhere can be daunting. Paul's informal guided tour of the souk set us up perfectly on our first morning.    Although a good walk from the main hustle 'n bustle this is an advantage as it is more tranquil around the Kasbah than the Place Jemma El Fna,Date of stay: October 2007,Trip type: Traveled with friends,Cheshire,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RubyCheshire
Riad Shemsi,Rikki-Lee wrote a review Nov 2007,50,A real treasure.....,Riad Shemsi is like a treasure chest...Behind it's large wooden door you will find a sparkling oasis. The hospitality however is what makes this place. The hosts and staff greet you on arrival for delicious mint tea and you will find that they continue to make sure you are well taken care of for the remainder of your stay.  Breakfast is amazing. Delicious fresh youghurts with stewed fruits made in the kitchen warm homemade pancakes drizzled with golden honey and the freshest orange juice you can imagine.  For lunch or dinner let the hosts book you into the restaurants or dine in the intimate dining area. Either will delight.  The rooms are very well equipped and have a luxurious Moroccan home feel. Light airy and there is plenty of space to relax and unwind.  The icing on the cake has to be the roof terrace. Overlooking the Old City with views of the palace walls you can sit and take in the silence with a back drop of the Atlas mountains before you go into the heart of the Souks and the Medina and that fellow visitors is a diferent world all together!

From the moment you first step through the big wooden door it is like you are entering a peaceful oasis. From the beautiful furniture to the ever helpful and friendly staff this riad cannot fault. The owners Liz and Paul are wonderful people and good friends of mine now. The food is absolutely delicious and the moroccan rose wine is particularly lovely! The rooftop terrace is perfect for relaxing in the sun and the first time you hear the call to prayer from up there is something you will never forget.

The Riad Shemsi proved to be the perfect accomodation for what turned out to be a challanging vibrant stimulating and exciting experience - we loved every minute of it!!  The Riad is about 20 mins walk from the Jemaa el Fna at the very end of a narrow alleyway off the main road through the kasbah. The huge wooden door opens into a delightful oasis of calmness and serenity - white colonnades and arches a blue swimming pool and graceful potted palms. In the evening the effect is heightened by artistic lighting candles and lanterns. The smell of traditional moroccan cuisine wafts enticingly from the kitchen which is right at the heart of the Riad.  The room we had was beautiful - the Chocolate Suite is spacious and comfortable. A great shower plenty of towels and robes and lovely toiletries make it luxurious place to recover from the dust and hubbub of the city.  The Staff were great. Liz the owner of the Riadwas around much of the time and together with her team provided a great balance of care information and helpfulness which made our holiday so enjoyable.,Date of stay: October 2007,Trip type: Traveled with family,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Suzijude

After hectic days sight seeing and the hustle and bustle of the Grande Place the souks and the kazbah this riad is a sea of tranquility. A beautifully decorated and furnished riad with cool and very private bedrooms and suites with a lovely terrace to relax on and a small pool to cool down in. The staff led by Moulay the manager and Nadia his assistant are friendly and helpful from the minute you walk through the door until you sadly have to leave.

Riad Shemsi,lydsLondon wrote a review Oct 2007,50,"Fantastic Riad, Amazing Service",I recently returned from spending a long weekend at Riad Shemsi with four of my best friends. We carefully chose accomodation as we were all going to celebrate our friend's birthday and wanted it be as special and comfortable as possible. I couldn't have asked for a better experience! The riad itself is beautiful but I felt that the helpfulness of the staff (and the owner Paul) is what made our time there so nice. They made such an effort to help us make this a memorable weekend and it certainly was. Although several members of the team there don't speak English I found their willingness to try to communicate with us went above and beyond what I would have expected. The breakfasts were so nice served on the terrace and every time we ordered any other drinks there would be bowls of olives and nuts brought along as well. We ate dinner in the riad on our last night and I felt it was one of the best meals we had in Marrakech. I felt so relaxed and pampered after just 4 days away and that is my best recommendation for Riad Shemsi!,Date of stay: October 2007,Trip type: Traveled with friends,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lydsLondon
Riad Shemsi,LMcambridge wrote a review Oct 2007,30,"Good, but not perfect!",We have just returned from Marrakesh and have mixed feeling about our trip in general.  On arrival at the riad there was no one english speaking to meet us. The lady who did give us mint tea and show us to our rooms did a great job with sign language and gestures but it wasn't what we expected. Our room like the whole riad was beautiful. We were suprised that there was no information in our room as you would find in most hotels and guest houses. That evening we met Nadia who was able to answer most of our questions and recommend a good resturant.  The following day we started exploring the city which was interesting. We found it hard to find many of the sights and everyone was trying to pursuade you to spend money in their shop. It was great to have the riad to escape to when it became too much. For us this happened after a couple of hours (and we have traveled a lot in Asia.) It is worse than any country we have previously visited. The pool was very cold but I liked this after a couple of hours in crowded souks! The location is excellent as you can walk to a lot of sights if you don't want to risk your life in a taxi!  The following day (saturday) was a holiday as it was ede and we weren't sure if all the resturants would be open. On Friday we asked Nadia who said that they probably wouldn't be so we asked to eat at the riad. She said we could give her our menu choices at breakfast but the following morning she wasn't there. We were told she had a day off and we couldn't communicate that we wanted to order dinner for that evening. We went to visit the Majorelle Gardens a highlight of our trip. Luckly all the resturants were open so we could eat out. We spoke to other guests during our stay and that day 1 couple were suprised to hear we had been to the Majorelle Gardens as Nadia had told them it was closed.  Sundays is Nadias day off but on Monday morning we were able to order dinner for that night our last in the riad. All the food there was very good. The breakfast were a great mix of fresh bread pancakes and yoghurt with a selections of jams and preserved fruit. The dinner was also good but there is no vegi option unless you eat fish. At 25 Euros it isn't bad value as we found most resturants to be western prices. We also chatted to another couple who showed us 3 A4 sheets in their room giving you all the information we wanted to know on our first day. Ours wasn't the only room that didn't have this.  When we arrived ther was a bottle of chilled water and 2 glasses in our room. There was no additional water provided and although it was very easy and cheap to buy there was no fridge. After the first day the glasses were removed and not replaced so every day we had to ask for 2 glasses! A minor but suprising occurence.  Overall we are glad we book this riad for location and the communial areas for relaxing. With only 1 person spreaking english and no cover for her time off this isn't what I expect when it is sold as an 'english speaking' riad.,Date of stay: October 2007,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Cambridge, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LMcambridge

Riad Shemsi,csgWestSussex wrote a review Oct 2007,50,Style and hospitality in a local neighbourhood,When the taxi dropped us at the end of a rabbit warren of alleyways we had no idea of the tranquility style and haven that lay behind the door of the Riad Shemsi. Paul and Liz the British owners have created a house of luxurious traditional furnishings with quiet comfortable rooms around a beautiful courtyard pool. The warmth of the surroundings were only surpassed by the hospitality and welcome from Nadia and the staff team for whom nothing was too much trouble. The Riad is situated in the heart of the Kasbah district which has a lovely local neighbourhood feel away from the hordes around la Place. Although the central tourist attractions of the central Medina are only a 15 minute stroll away through easily navigated backsteets where normal life continues oblivious to the odd tourist wandering (perfectly safely even late at night) among the local populace going about their daily business. This is real Marrakech not that merely aimed at the tourist trade. The breakfasts at the Riad were healthy and delicious whilst there was also the option of staying in to enjoy the daily sourced and freshly prepared lunches and dinners with a choice of wonderful home cooked local cuisine. The owners and staff of this Riad are justifiably proud of their home away from home. If you seek a tranquil retreat from which to explore this fabulous city you will not be disappointed by any length of stay here we cannot wait to return soon.,Date of stay: October 2007,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,west sussex,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/csgWestSussex

It was a beautiful a lovely calm oasis in the madness and choas that is Marrakech. They arranged a taxi to collect us from the airport which was essential as it's tricky to find and when you first arrive the whole thing is so jaw dropping and daunting you'll want your hand held! A couple of days later you'll be walking down the Rue de Kasbah like a local. We had dinner in the Riad on our first night this was very good and a nice start to our holiday. Restaurants are in short supply here most are to be found in the New Town taxi's easily available at a variety of prices! (ask first!) We has left a bag at the Riad when we went on our trip around Morocco (on purpose we needed to reduce our luggage) when we went to retrieve it we were welcomed back like old friends! Kids loved the pool small but very refreshing and mum loved the variety of places to relax. Lovely staff lovely rooms good breakfasts and air conditioning - vital in the Summer.,Date of stay: July 2007,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Staffordshire, UK",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Judy1963

Riad Shemsi,livealittleLondon wrote a review Jun 2007,40,oasis in a crazy city,This is a beautiful little Riad in a residential area away from all the hustle and bustle of this city. The little plunge pool in the courtyard was ideal to cool down in the soaring heat. An added bonus for a good-nights sleep is that it is nowhere near a mosque. Nadia who appears to be the receptionist is very helpful but overall management appears to be a bit haphazard. Give it some more time as it only opened six months ago. Best to get the airport transfer when you first arrive as you'll never find this riad and locals don't know it either.,Date of stay: June 2007,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/livealittleLondon

Riad Shemsi,albertandann wrote a review May 2007,50,An Experience Not To Be Missed,We so enjoyed sharing the experiences of Marrakech from this  beautiful Riad. We certainly feel we were transported into a different world amongst such friendly and helpful people. The memories will live with us for a long time and should they fade we will be back! A special thank you to the staff at the Riad for making our stay so delightful and attending to our every need. We thoroughly recommend Riad Shemsi situated in the heart of the Casbah to anyone wishing to relax in a very tasteful and authentic setting. The meals are cooked from organic freshly purchased produce to a very high standard and are delicious!

Riad Shemsi,HoshiBerkshire wrote a review Apr 2007,40,pleasantly surprised,We were worried about booking this riad because there were no reviews but it only opened at Christmas so pretty new really. Nadia who was there everyday was very helpful and spoke good English. The breakfasts were huge and really good. Location was pretty good 15 / 20 mins from the square - buy the rough guide map to Marrakesh (you really need it) the streets were well lit at night. Everyone says that you don't get any hassle in Marrakesh - they are probably right but I don't think I would want to walk back to the riad alone. Inside is nicely decorated and the terraces are lovely. We had the Vanille room which was basic but still very nice. In retospect i would say that the extra money for the Chocolate sweet would be worth it. The room was very cold but when we told the staff they brought us a heater and then fitted a new aircon system the next day! There is no safe in the room and it doesn't lock but stangely I wasn't worried at all - it felt really safe. We stupidly left our passports at reception for 3 days while we were in the mountains and they were waiting for us when we returned. No complaints very nice few days.,Date of stay: March 2007,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Berkshire,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HoshiBerkshire
