Riad Mandalay,Jan D wrote a review Mar 23,40,Fun visit to Marrakesh.,We booked a 4 night stay at the Riad Fatouma in Marrakesh in March 2023. There were 6 of us three couples. When we got to the Fatouma we were informed that our hotel would be changed to the Mandalay. Abdul came to take us through the maze of streets with our luggage and checked us in. We had a nice spacious room with a generous sized double bed and a single too. Our friends in the room next to us had 5 beds in their room!  There is a big space on the roof for sitting about and sunbathing or enjoying the evening chatting to friends.  There is a pool but more for just cooling in than swimming.    Breakfast was good - pancakes and pastries and coffee and tea. Last day we had an omelette.    The Riad is a lovely calm place in a mad bustling city and Abdul and the cook and Kasim are very helpful and friendly.  Don’t expect western style luxury ie complimentary soaps coffee tea and kettles but do expect a warm welcome and a genuine desire to make your stay as enjoyable as possible.,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Stamford Bridge, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JanDeanYorkUK
Riad Mandalay,Tessa wrote a review Mar 20,20,"It looks nothing like the pictures, and most definitely not 3 or 4 stars",On arrival at the Riad Mandalay the manager had no knowledge of my booking for a room for 3 people A booking that was confirmed 2 months prior to my trip to Morocco.  My family and I were left to wait in the lobby for over an hour while the manager tried to look for our booking.  Two hours later we were transferred to another Riad into a shoebox room for 1 night.  The next day we were given a room at the Mandalay the room was dirty the bedsheets had stains and hair on them the walls were dirty. The tv did not work the list goes on.  The Riad has alot of potential but the maintenance and cleaning is of a poor standard.  The Riad Mandalay is not a 4 star more of a 1 star.  Although the next day after making a complaint we were given a cleaner room by this time we were halfway into our short trip and the experience left us feeling exhausted and uncomfortable.,Date of stay: February 2023,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TessaNicky
Riad Mandalay,Natalie S wrote a review Feb 2023,40,The Real Marrakech,We really enjoyed our 3 nights stay in Riad Mandalay and Marrakech. Manage your expectations as it isn't a hotel and the rate half board n February through tour operator 'Love Holidays' is £36 pppn so be realistic its not really fancy but is beautiful in its own right. The two guys who run the show are lovely and really helpful if you go half board the food at dinner is delicious usually a tagine meal (ask in the morning if you want wine with your dinner & they'll sort it for you) the rooms are clean and the location once you get your bearings is ideal. We booked excursions via 'trip advisor' the Atlas Mountains 5 valleys & lunch and the hot air balloon flight both amazing and recommended. The local sights are all in walking distance .. p.s if on your walk to Badi Palace your told by a local lad its closed .. its not he is just going to take you to his employers shop instead .. sharing our lesson learnt ;),Date of stay: February 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M8797ELnatalies
Riad Mandalay,MummybearCambridge wrote a review Jan 2023,10,Not as described,We stayed here for 1 night of the 3 booked and then moved to a different hotel.  It was very run down and not in a cool ancient building kind of way. It also felt dirty with bird poop on the breakfast table.  As a tranquil haven to the craziness of Marrakech it certainly wasn’t. 5 hours of a dog barking at night.  It’s only saving grace was the lovely manager. He was a lovely person and did not stop.,Date of stay: January 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Cambridge,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MummybearCambridge

Also 15 minute walk to Jamal el fnaa famous market Square for everything.    Staff are amazing warmly greeted by Kareem who provided all info and was very helpful he helped us on few occasions as he gave his mobile Abdul is the guy who takes care of all the guest this guy is loved by all always smiling and willing to help my kids loved him. You will not find more helpful people. Also local shop for water and small items a minute walk.  Finally the house keepers both ladies were hard working and always on hand to help they deal with everything had sink block my own fault as suddenly vomited and I cleaned up but gutter blocked ladies sorted with in 20 minutes.    Hotel itself is amazing a real life classical prestigious place the rich would have lived in now converted to Riad meaning garden decorated with plants and art    The location is in the old streets so down narrow roads but roads are safe I was out with family till 11pm even 12:30 at night and felt safe well lit area.

Riad Mandalay,Edward C wrote a review Jul 2018,50,"First-class hospitality in an elegant, authentic setting.","We loved everything about Riad Matham! During our ten-day stay we enjoyed our beautiful room decorated with local textiles our comfy bed our view of the verdant courtyard. Our breakfasts on the roof-top terrace (with panoramic views) were always delicious with omelets freshly squeezed orange juice fresh fruit smoothies several types of bread jam tea and delicious coffee. This terrace offers a shady spot to lounge and read plus sunny spots to sunbath in comfort and privacy.  Hicham a manager gave wise advice and responded promptly to every request. The other guests were pleasant and provided useful information.  The location in the medina is ideal for experiencing the historic center -- convenient to museums shopping restaurants. A short walk to a ""taxi stand"" gets you everywhere else.  Advice: Do accept their offer to arrange for the taxi from the airport Hicham or others will meet your taxi and escort you to the Riad. It's a genuine service for guests not a moneymaker for the Riad.  After a day-long excursion do enjoy a candlelight dinner in one of the cozy sitting areas off the central courtyard -- superb!

Riad Mandalay,ciaramc82 wrote a review Nov 2015,50,Beautiful oasis in Marrakech,Stayed in RIad Mandalay over the weekend with friends and Jean Luc and Beatrice were so friendly and helpful. The large wooden door hides a peaceful beautiful oasis behind with ornate traditional dark wood furniture and lamps dotted around many seating areas to enjoy a book and a coffee. The rooms were comfortable and the roof top terrace was a perfect spot to relax and sunbathe on a hot Saturday before wandering around Marrakech. Our hosts were eager to offer suggestions for restaurants and maps and even to guide us to the square. It is in the Kasbah area and a short all to the ruins of the Sultan's tombs and another 10 minutes to Djem el Fna Place. Would definitely recommend Riad Mandalay to visitors.,Date of stay: October 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Dublin, Ireland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ciaramc82

We had two suites airport transfer breakfast and dinner for first night. All of that was done nicely and comfortably. The rooms were clean and nicely decorated. Overall It was a nice different experience than regular hotels.    Location is good and next to Saadeen tombs. It is within the walled city and you experience the traditional Moroccans in that area.

Riad Mandalay,yoseph_ghazal wrote a review Aug 2015,50,A Different Experience (In a good way),This Riad is definitely worth staying in. There was absolutely nothing I would want different from my stay. I came in with my family and we felt at home right when we got there. The owner Jean made us feel at home right away by treating us with a traditional Moroccan dinner introducing us to his family and making sure we had everything we wanted. Just ask him for anything such as water or an adapter and he'll make sure you'll get it. The maids there were really friendly and made us the best food. The rooms are comfy spacious and includes an AC unit so it's always cool on those hot Moroccan days. The architecture here is beautiful mixing traditional Arab aspects along with a touch of modern items. Overall whether you come with a family or by yourself I'd definitely recommend it.,Date of stay: August 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Paris, France",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yoseph_ghazal
Riad Mandalay,AnaLopesAndre wrote a review Jul 2015,40,A lovely place to stay in Marrakech,In the Marrakech Medina Riad Mandalay is the perfect place to relax from the Marrakech agitation.    The Riad is very quiet relaxing clean and with beautiful moroccan details.  The rooms are simple cozy with an amazing bathroom and everything is very clean.

Riad Mandalay,Lilou1203 wrote a review Jun 2015,40,Beautiful / Clean / Central / PERFECT STAY,This Riad is very comfortable and beautiful. Modern butt with Arabic elements. The pool is big enough to get refreshed.  The owners are very polite and always willing to help. Very nice people. We enjoyed our stay very much. It was quite but also very central ...not more than 10 minutes walk to the Djema el Fna. Also all other places are easy to reach. In case you have any question regarding trips or airport pick off...the owner are always available and willing to organize something.    All rooms are perfectly clean and well furniture. Towels shampoo and shower gel are provided. Also nice typical Moroccan dresses you can wear at the hotel.    The terrace on top of the building is also very beautiful but we didn't stay there during our stay.  The only thing I would improve is the breakfast. Its tasty and served nicely but it´s very simple and always sweet. So it depends you long you stay at the hotel. After 4 days you might want to have a different breakfast than (marmalade and honey). But this is just a personal remark.    Overall we enjoyed our stay and we felt totally welcomed.,Date of stay: May 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Frankfurt, Germany",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lilou1203
Riad Mandalay,vivienne a wrote a review Apr 2015,50,Lovely place with lovely hosts,We had a super great an inspiring first time in Marrakech. The Riad Mandalay is situated in a cool area called Kasbah. 15 min walk from the place EL Fna. We enjoyed Kasbah a lot. It is not so touristic as around El Fna and more original than next to the place You find there nice ans cheap places to eat and to shop. We were so happy after a long day to come back to this area and also to the extremely nice Riad mandalay with its luxury clean and open atmosphere. The Room was beautiful and clean as you see it on the pictures. Everything is like on the pictures and even nicer. We felt like in the Movie „1000 and one Night“.  The breakfast was homemade and very delicious. It was no problem to have it in the courtyard or on the rooftop enjoying the nice terrace and the sun.  The french couple Jean-Luc and Bea running the Riad Mandaly in the best way. They are super helpful and extremely friendly.  They organized us a driver to the „Atlas mountains“ where we were skiing. the best experience in a long time! We really want to come back as soon as possible.,Date of stay: March 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Berlin, Germany",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/240viviennea
Riad Mandalay,Travelcritic5617 wrote a review Apr 2015,50,Amazing oasis in the heart of Marrakech,Being our first visit to Marrkesh both my husband and myself were eagerly looking forward to discover how a Riad feels like.  This place in the Kasbah area (close to the medina and the plaza) is quietly tucked away from all the noise and hustle-bustle of Morocco. The room was comfortable spacious pretty homely and neat. We loved the bathroom with its Moroccan decor. The patio with its petite swimming pool plants couches and tables was the best part of our stay where we enjoyed delicious and fresh breakfast during our 5-day stay and spent many an afternoon relaxing between touristic trips. The Riad smells amazing at all times and has a spa and massage center that offers its services to its guests! The transfers to and from the airport were organized by the Riad and priced reasonably.  The hosts Beatrice and Jean Luc were extremely nice to us. Always sporting a smile and helping us with everything during our stay. Out of curiosity we asked them about how they prepared one of the dishes served everyday at breakfast and Voila!.. Their Moroccan chef taught us the recipe and even gifted us some of the crepe she prepared for our trip back. We owe them a big thank you for going the extra mile to make us feel at home and for their generosity. We did not wanna leave!  All in all the stay was FANTASTIC and we will definitely go back when we travel to Marrakech again!

Riad Mandalay,TDG87 wrote a review Mar 2015,50,Lovely place to stay!,The Riad is in a good location not too far a walk from the street and less than 10 minutes from the main square in the old town. Even so we found it to be a very quiet and relaxing place to stay once you are inside the walls. We had an absolutely wonderful stay the owners are truly lovely and went out of their way to make sure we were comfortable well fed full of the local tea and had the directions we needed to get ourselves around the city. The rooms were getting a make over while we were there ours was simple but had everything we needed and was comfortable especially the beds! I would definitely recommend this Riad to anyone traveling to Marrakech.,Date of stay: March 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TDG87
Riad Mandalay,MAS1001 wrote a review Mar 2015,50,Our 1st Riad experience,We (my wife and myself) visited Marrakesh and stayed at this Riad. We were pleasantly surprised by our stay. This Riad was tucked away in the back street of Kasbah. The facility was managed by a French couple who had been in-charge for approx 2months. Both were extremely polite helpful and courteous and we wish them success in this venture. We had freshly cooked breakfast each morning. As regards location I would say if you are looking for a place with swimming pool huge buffet breakfast and want to visit Marrakesh like a tourist then this is NOT the place for you. However if you want to immerse yourself in the culture mingle with the locals and see them go about their business and want a place with a personal touch to relax after your day's activities then I would definitely recommend Riad Mandalay. Within 5 minutes walk you go from quite lazy back streets to hustle and bustle of Kasbah and to attractions. If we visit Marrakesh again we would stay here again.,Date of stay: March 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MAS1001
Riad Mandalay,Amber S wrote a review Oct 2014,50,Amazing stay at a great Riad,I stayed at the Riad Mandalay with 2 friends for a long weekend break in Marrakech.    We had arranged the airport pickup. It took us almost two hours to get through security at Marrakech airport and when we got to the other side the driver understandably wasn't there waiting for us. We called the Riad and it got sorted- a new driver arrived & we made our way to the Medina. The airport pick up is considerably more expensive than getting the local taxis but with it being our first time in Marrakech that was definitely a good decision. Unless you know where the riad is it would have been pretty hard to locate if the first time. Once you know where it is it is very easy to navigate around the Medina.    We stayed in the white room and the room was gorgeous...beautiful room & beautiful bath.    Breakfast everyday was so good. We had different options for the 4 days we'd stayed there...can't fault it at all.    Patrice & Aline were perfect hosts the whole team looked after us very well very friendly & they answered any questions we had.    I would highly recommend the Riad Mandalay.,Date of stay: September 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmberS636
Riad Mandalay,Hana0817 wrote a review Oct 2014,40,Haven on a backstreet.,We found riad Mandalay tucked away like a haven in the back streets of Marrakech. Walking into the central courtyard instantly relaxed us after the hustle and bustle of the streets. A simple but lovely breakfast was offered. The rooms were all individually decorated in their own style. We were lucky that it was off season and the riad was very quiet it might be a bit noisy if the riad was full as our room (the blue room) opened directly onto the central courtyard so we could hear other people on the sofas outside our room. We also stayed in the white room upstairs for one night and it was gorgeous! The riad kindly provided towels and big hats to use if you fancied using the sum terrace. On our last day our flight wasn't until late at night but the owners were happy to let us stay after our check out time. We didn't chose to get the riad to pick us up at the airport but we probably should have done. However once we knew where we were we found our way to and from the riad on foot easily enough for the rest of the trip.,Date of stay: September 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Nottingham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hana0817
Riad Mandalay,Patpv wrote a review Jul 2014,10,Pick Another!,Not sure where those good reviews came from...our experience was not a good one. Before we even got there we had the issue of our trying to reach them to alter our reservation and to arrange a pick up...no response. Then from the moment we entered the riad (after not being picked up at the airport and not being able to find the location without the help of a local guy...who of course wanted to be paid for the help). The owners were basically unfriendly...all the way through our stay...and it lasted almost a week...if we could have moved we would have. We were the only guests for the first 3 days...when asked for assistance we got a line on a map to direct us to the main square...when asked for assistance whether for an excursion or a ride back to the airport...their prices were higher...why they would want to take advantage of their guests is a mystery. Just when we thought it was just us...another couple who showed up commented on the same feelings...awkward rude and unhelpful. We met so many people during our stay that had nice stays at other riads...I would suggest picking another. We travel quite a bit and have never had such an uncomfortable experience...what a disappointment!,Date of stay: July 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Puerto Vallarta, Mexico",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Patpv
Riad Mandalay,Elwingstar wrote a review May 2014,50,Gorgeous Riad!... in the heart and soul of the Kasbah!,Where to start?... The Riad Mandalay has a beautiful warm wonderful environment! ...with its relaxing atmosphere and cool music playing during daylight hours... we couldn't have been happier at the Riad. There was a mix up with our room which the owners (the lovely and awesome Patrice and Aline) were incredible about and before we knew it we had the room we had booked.    Now without going into the details we had a couple of not so ideal events occur whilst we were in Marrakech which without the care and help from Patrice and Aline would have been a lot worse we can't thank them enough for the warmth and assistance they offered. We will remember our time there fondly because of them.    We are frequent travellers and as such had organised much ourselves but Patrice always was happy with information anytime... ps he also lent me a phone charger as ours didn't work there this is the awesomeness of the hosts!!    Breakfast was light and yummy a great start for a day of exploring. We loved the terrace and got a bit of welcome sunshine after the UK winter!    Everything is close by and we thought had more character filled than staying in the Medina. The Kasbah was our favourite place in Marrakech something more real about it.

Riad Mandalay,Chris W wrote a review Apr 2014,50,A fantastic find - the perfect Marrakech experience,Our first time visiting Marrakech and what a great break we had; friends advised us to stay at a Riad-style hotel and so after a little internet searching we chose Riad Mandalay. What an absolutely fantastic find - the perfect combination of good location (just 10 to 15 minutes walk from Place Jemaa el Fna) but hidden away in the heart of the Kasbah; lovely rooms quiet and calm away from the busy bustle and Patrice and Aline the perfect hosts. We took advantage of the airport transfer - well recommended and there was Patrice waiting for us with an umbrella (yes - it was hammering down with rain) at the entrance to the Kasbah to guide us down the alleys to the Riad. We stayed four nights spending time in the souk (doesn't everybody) visiting the Saadian Tombs and the Palais de la Bahia amongst other sights. A day trip out to the Atlas mountains gave us a short break from the busy city life - a little touristy perhaps but very enjoyable and fantastic views of the snow-capped peaks. Marrakech can be quite a culture shock to start with but after a couple of hours we were right at home. It's just four weeks ago since we visited - it feels like an age; wholeheartedly recommend the Riad Mandalay for your stay.,Date of stay: March 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Ormskirk, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J2824DFchrisw
Riad Mandalay,Mezeman wrote a review Mar 2014,50,An Oasis of peace in the Kasbah,"Just back from a week in Marrakech. The Riad is ideally situated in the heart of the Kasbah so that the main sites of interest are all within easy walking distance. The owners (French) are very friendly and helpful with suggested places to visit arranging transfers to and from the Riad (essential in Marrakech) and providing meals/drinks on request. Local mint tea is provided free on request and is very refreshing. The Riad has 6/7 rooms all beautifully decorated to a high standard. The Riad has real presence and character and is certainly impressive after spending time in the hustle and bustle of central Marrakech. On the roof is a very peaceful sun terrace with about 8 sun loungers and a few tables and chairs. You can have tea/meals up there on request. It is very civilized and you are made to feel one of the family rather than a guest. Wine is available in the Riad despite being in the ""dry"" old part of the city. Tasteful background music is on in the background downstairs. In a week there were no repeat tracks and it was a nice mix of jazz and chilled music. Owners English was very good. The odd sentence in French can be a help. Food very reasonably priced. Nice free breakfast. Massage & Hammam available. Couldn't fault the place really.

Riad Mandalay,Nicola C.P wrote a review Mar 2014,50,Perefct place to stay in Marrakech,We stayed at the Riad Mandalay for 4 nights in November (I haven't had chance to review until now but made time as it was so excellent). Patrice and Aline are very accommodating and more than happy to advise and help. Breakfast was lovely... substantial and varied each day. We only ate during the evening on our last night but regret not eating there more. It was delicious. Maryam is an excellent cook and we wish we hadn't spent the time we did looking for and eating at other restaurants that were more expensive and nowhere near as nice. Again Patrice and Aline were happy to serve us outside their regular hours to fit in with our flight time. The rooms are individual and very welcoming and comfortable.  Overall the Riad Mandalay is a fantastic peaceful place to stay and a complete contrast to the madness and hustle and bustle of Marrakech. I'm not sure we would have got through our holiday without the haven of the Riad Mandalay!,Date of stay: November 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Manchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nicolacP6818ON
Riad Mandalay,jamesbond007_10 wrote a review Mar 2014,50,Lovely and peaceful,From start to finish a fantastic holiday. Riad arranged for us to picked up from airport which went very smoothly. Arrived at Riad after walking through a couple of very busy streets to find a very lovely oasis . First impressions were very good after putting bags into room Patrice made us some mint tea gave us a map and talked us through the key tourist sites and some very useful key information for our stay. Our room was on the ground floor and had a great feel loved the open plan shower and slept like a log. breakfast was very nice and a light start to the day. My partner had a scrub and massage in the spa and she said it was very good. We only ate at the Riad once food was very good albeit slightly higher price than you would pay in local restaurant. Used the sun terrace once and was a great space to relax and take in the sun. Overall a fantastic holiday and a great place to stay good location and excellent hosts. Many Thanks,Date of stay: March 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,North east Scotland,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamesbond007_10
Riad Mandalay,madassoup wrote a review Feb 2014,50,Riad Mandalay - quiet sanctuary,The lovely people at Riad Mandalay were fabulous and came to our rescue after we arrived to Marrakech to discover our booked accommodation at Dar Cherif was awful. We found this Riad on Tripadvisor and it was utterly lovely - such a relief. A calm oasis. Lovely décor. Great breakfast. Peaceful (great for a good night's sleep) and a nice terrace to catch some sunshine. The location was very convenient for attractions such as the Saddien Tombs and Bahia Palace. An easy walk to the main square and also a big taxi rank round the corner. We had a Hammam in the Riad before we left for our flight which was very enjoyable. All in all I would very much recommend this lovely Riad.,Date of stay: January 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/madassoup
Riad Mandalay,namesalreadytaken wrote a review Jan 2014,50,All round excellence,We have just returned from a thoroughly enjoyable New Year's break. Patrice and Aline are excellent hosts. Having chosen the very reasonably priced airport transfer we were met by Patrice at the taxi stop taken to the riad and having seen our large comfortable room we enjoyed mint tea while Patrice advised us on the best places to visit in the Medina.  They were also happy to arrange excursions and took us to the taxi stop to ensure pick up. The riad itself is delightful even in early January we enjoyed reading in the sun on the roof terrace albeit wearing jumpers! Ditto the riad (courtyard) when the sun had set.  As others have mentioned the location is very convenient all main sights an easy walk ( tho' getting lost is inevitable in the Medina!). We had two dinners including a New Year's Eve special dinner Maryam is a good cook and portions were beyond generous! Breakfasts were excellent fresh orange juice yogurt good bread and delicious daily specials (cakes or pancakes) from Maryam's kitchen.  A wonderful place to return to after a day in the sometimes chaotic seeming Medina. Added bonuses my very relaxing massage and good wifi connection.,Date of stay: January 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,SE England,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/namesalreadytaken
Riad Mandalay,cici3177 wrote a review Dec 2013,50,beautiful Oasis in Marrakech,I absolutely loved my stay at Riad Mandalay. Its a beautiful oasis in the medina of Marrakech easy to find walking distance to Djemna el fna and the souks. Patrice and Aline are very welcoming and helpful. The Riad is beautifully decorated wich much attention to detail and lots of colours and plants. The rooms are stunning with huge bathrooms. We were there end of November and therefore didnt make use of the roof terrace but there is one. I can definitely recommend this Riad and will go back on my next visit to Marrakech.,Date of stay: November 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Interlaken, Switzerland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cici3177

Nothing was too much trouble for the owners Patrice and Aline - helpful directions and recommendations assistance booking taxis and trips and a genuine desire to help and to ensure we had a great stay. Lovely and quiet but very conveniently located for sight-seeing - in our 5 day stay we were able to walk almost everywhere. Marrakech is a beautiful but crazy city and it was great to have somewhere peaceful and welcoming to come back to each evening. We are looking forward to our return visit. Would thoroughly recommend booking direct with the Riad rather than using Booking.com or similar - they are extremely accommodating and helpful.

Riad Mandalay,Alastair W wrote a review Feb 2013,50,"Calm welcoming oasis, highly recommended",We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Riad Mandalay. The Riad is a beautiful calm oasis with a roof terrace where drinks can be served and where you can enjoy the lovely weather once you return from the bustling medina. It is a good location because the main square and sites are within walking distance. There are also restaurants on the doorstep so you do not have to return to the main square to eat if you want to eat out rather than eating in the Riad. We recommend the spa and the Hammam scrub! Aline and Patrice are excellent kind and generous hosts who will stop at nothing to ensure that your stay is everything it should be. We will be back with our daughter soon for a massage and a trip into the Atlas mountains.,Date of stay: February 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"West Malling, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlastairW853
Riad Mandalay,C W wrote a review Feb 2013,50,"Fantastic,highly recommended",I loved my stay at Riad Mandalay. It is very conveniently located and I was able to walk to most places that I wanted to visit. It was my first time to Marrakech and Patrice and Aline were extremely welcoming and a great help in finding my way about the Kasbah and wider Marrakech. This is a very hectic city and coming back to the Riad each day to a fabulous mint tea was the perfect way to unwind after getting lost in the Souks and sightseeing. I had dinner twice at the Riad and both meals were generously portioned and excellent with breakfast being lighter but still a great start to the day. Riad Mandalay is relaxed spacious and private and I would recommend it without hesitation.

Riad Mandalay,SoumitreeG wrote a review Dec 2012,40,loved it...overall great!,firstly it's at a convenient location in medina...not too near the main square (jemma-el-fnaa) but within walking distance. situated on rue kasbah and very near to the Bab Agnou and the mosque this was ideal.  neat Riad reasonable prices and calm and quiet!  best thing was the manager and the staff...starting from Claudio the GM (who is a super-chilled super helpful reggae-loving guy) and rest of staff - they were great. Claudio helped us with explaining all the sites/ sounds around Medina - places to go places to eat etc - and also set us up with the tours to ourika valley and the 2-day Zagora trip...  there' a small pool in the courtyard (was a bit cold for us to use) and an in-house massage and hammam center (just give them advance notice for the hammam/ massage though).  breakfast was a nice simple affair of crossiants bread preserves pancake juice etcand you could order food at the riad too from a choice of spread which were mainly moroccon/ italian leaning...and the courtyard was a nice place to catch up with fellow-travellers.  our rooms were not too large but there were other rooms which were larger...check availability while booking.  it will be like staying with friends...we hope it stays like this.,Date of stay: December 2012,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Jersey City, New Jersey",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SoumitreeG

From the moment we walked in we got a really helpful crash course to the Medina and was givin a map an amazing cup of tea.    We were booked for a fancy pants hotel on the side for the second half of the trip and I knew then and I know now that I should have canceled and just stayed here. Super affordable for what you get.    Also there was like a couple models from Paris who were working there or hanging out or something..

Riad Mandalay,Janice P wrote a review Sep 2012,50,A quiet place to recuperate,We arrived in Marrakech with the intention of staying only two nights. We both have terrible colds and were very happy to find a quiet place to recuperate. Claudio an his staff were extremely helpful in pointing us in the right direction for ATM's food and attractions. They also provided us with a quiet air conditioned place to rest. Our room was large and clean. The beds very comfortable. Continental breakfast is included with very good coffee. We bought at the local market stall to add to our meal. We also took advantage of their private hammam and would highly recommend booking a session there. It is such a treat to be able to walk up to your room for a rest instead of trying to find your way back from an offsite location. The location is very easy to find which is a big plus in such a maze of streets! The Riad is close the Bab Aganou. There are many small and good restaurants in the neighbourhood and the main square is only a 10 minute walk away. We would highly recommend a stay here. BTW...we ended up staying four nights!,Date of stay: September 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Vancouver, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JaniceP895

Phew!,After an hour and a half getting lost around the Kasbah area of Marrakech we finally found Riad Mandalay (thanks to a 10-year old local and 20 dirham!) and walked into a cool calm and beautiful retreat. We were warmly greeted by Amaia and served delicious and refreshing mint tea whilst she took us through the main sights and tips for our stay in Marrakech. Our room was large and comfortable with lovely decor. Thumbs up for the bathroom and great toiletries too! The riad is very pretty inside but also benefits from a laid-back and friendly vibe. We enjoyed chatting to Amaia and Giorgia and they gave us lots of info and cultural insight. Breakfast was good and the roof terrace too... It was so nice to know we could escape back to Mandalay for a breather after the chaos and intensity of the medina!

Riad Mandalay,JuniperTree44 wrote a review Dec 2011,50,"Great Riad in a good location, with big, clean rooms and amazing staff.",We found Riad Mandalay online and are sooo happy we did so. We initially stayed for 4 nights and then did a tour and it was so great that we booked for another 2 nights after our tour. The location is in the Kazba about 10-15 min walk to the main center depending on the people traffic. Once you are taken there the first time it is fairly easy to find. We walked back around midnight a few nights and felt pretty safe although I probabley wouldn't go without my husband at that time. The rooms are spacious with big bathroom. Soap shampoo and lotion was provided which is rare for europe let alone africa. Hot water is available for 15 minutes at a time with a ten min. wait time in between. I found 15 minutes enough for a shower and washing my hair. Breakfast is adequate. The day staff are super nice and Georgia and Claudio are fantastic. They share stories make the best mint tea I've had in Morocco and Claudio's italian cooking was awesome. They also were helpful when we needed a clinic and medicine. They are always there to give help and guidance. The place is truely an oasis after a day spend in the chaos of Marrakech. There is free wifi with decent connection. The rooms have ac and heating we were able to borrow a hair dryer and we even were able to do our laundry. I really enjoyed our stay already recommended it to people we met in Fez and would stay there again without hesitation. I have just met some more people who are going to Marrakech in Feb. We have once again recommended the riad to them.    As far as the tour offered at the riad it is similar to a lot of the ones offerred by most hotels/hostels. We found the tour company unreliable and in the end had to pay more because another couple had cancelled. This is by NO means a reflection of the riad but if you choose to do the tour try to get at least 4 people together so the tour company doesn't screw you over. The tour itself (3 days/2 nights) was pretty awesome.,Date of stay: December 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Kamloops, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JuniperTree44
Riad Mandalay,NicciR wrote a review Dec 2011,30,Not as nice as we thought and stressful,The photos on-line make the rooms seem nicer than they really are. In person they are simple and calling them suites is a stretch. The common area was pretty and true to the images although the pool is smaller. We stayed here for 3 nights.    It took multiple attempts to book directly because the phone number was answered by another hotel's name and the woman hung up on us when we asked if it was Riad Mandalay. This should have been our first clue to book elsewhere. We booked the day before arrival and she told us someone would be pick us up at the train station around 10p to take us to the raid. After our long 7 hour train journey nobody was there to greet and guide us to our hotel in the dark unfamiliar city. It wouldn't have been such an ordeal if we could simply hop into a cab and tell them where to go but the location was deep in the maze of the casbah that most cars are too big to enter. Plus we don't speak French or Arabic. After an hour of waiting we asked a local if we could use his cell phone to contact the riad. They told us to take a taxi to a certain place at the entrance to the casbah and someone would meet us there. The taxi driver overcharged us 6x the rate since he watched our situation from outside and knew we were desperate. It's terrible feeling to be taken advantage of in this way knowing you don't have any options. Two men in their 20's met our taxi and we followed them on foot down pitch black alleys to the riad. They claimed that the taxi company they hired did not answer the phone at first and told them that someone had been there to meet us. I was surprised that he also said this has happened to other guests a few times before. I suggested using a new service since it's very stressful for the guests and he said that it was the best one.    This riad is managed by a young Italian staff that don't seem to care about helping the guests since you can't find them most of the time and when you do they act inconvenienced.The next morning at breakfast Giorgia gave us a map and quickly circled 20-25 places to go. She let us know that she and all of the staff would be gone entire day out of town. She gave us a cell number but I'm not sure how that would have helped. That night they returned and were talking so loud that I had to ask them to shut their door and windows to the kitchen because we couldn't sleep.    The windows and doors are made of wooden shutters that do not seal well allowing sound and cigarette smoke to enter easily. The entire hotel was constantly filled with smoke from all the staff and guests....morning day and night. We had to ask someone smoking on the balcony next to our room if they could move to the other side since smoke was seeping into our closed up room. This was not an issue elsewhere in Morocco which is why I thought important to mention for non-smokers. They need to put some type of backing on windows and doors to help with the noise and smoke issues.    The bedroom doors are 2 tall wooden doors closed with a 8-10 inch brass bolt pushed into a hole then locked with a pad lock. The handle inside our room was broken from our bolt so we had hold the peg with our fingers and jam it into the hole. It was so tight that it slammed and pinched my finger making it bruise badly. When I pointed it out to Giorgia she shrugged it off and said that it was like that when came to work there. She didn't care one bit that the broken handle injured a guest and wasn't interested in repairing it. I'm sure it would not have cost more than a few Euro to fix. Our shower head was also broken leaving a hole in the wall.    Breakfast was a simple basket of bread jam juice and coffee. We ate at the riad the fist night and ordered pasta that was al dente as requested but bolognese was sauce was not much better than out of a jar. The pesto was better but not great. A disappointment considering the cook was Italian and I read good reviews.    Also plan on getting lost trying to find your way back the first full day and night if you stay here. Someone tried to rob me of my cell phone walking through the meat market in the busy morning just a couple minutes from the riad. My husband was in front of me and unbeknownst to me a tall Moroccan man was following from behind. He was watching me take photos with my iPhone then placing it in the side pocket of my travel purse rested over my navel. His arm reached over my shoulder across my torso and into my bag. I slapped my phone out of his hand as he pulled it over my shoulder. No police around and the thief just stood there as I yelled for police. I understand that this can happen anywhere in the world but I wanted to share my experience with this location.,Date of stay: November 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Atlanta, Georgia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NicciR

Riad Mandalay,Rocio V wrote a review Nov 2011,50,Great Riad,"This Riad is beautiful nice and peaceful just what you need after the craziness of exploring the Medina and the zocos it even makes you wonder where did all that noise go?. It is very well located inside the Medina just a 10-15 minute walk (depending on how many distractions you encounter in you way possibly a lot haha) to the Djema El Fna famous plaza.  The inner patio is beautiful invites you to relax it even has a pool wich we didn´t use because we were in Morocco in winter. The terrace is also a nice place with views of the Medina and the mosque nearby. It also has a mini spa offering hammams jacuzzi massages and skin treatments.  The room we stayed in was spacious and comfortable simply but nicely decorated and clean. More in the ""modern"" side of decoration not traditional. The bathroom was huge and beautiful you even get shampoo and body wash wich is something unexpected in Morocco and to be grateful for.  Giorgia and Claudio the hosts are really welcoming and nice eager to help you with tips and recommendations for your Marrakech experience. They make you feel at home as the feel in general in this riad is very laid back and relaxing but with the good service you´d expect. They can help you with your airport transport or to book any trip you would like to make around Morocco.  Claudio is an italian chef we enjoyed a must needed italian dinner in one of the nights we stayed there simply delicious and an appreciated change to the all-moroccan food we had been eating during a week. The breakfasts are rather small but good.  We were two girls travelling by ourselves and didn´t have any problems at all although it may seem the riad is in a dark alley you never feel unsafe and it is pretty easy to learn your way back.  I´d totally recommend this riad if you´re going to Marrakech and I would definitly stay here If I´m ever back.

We were two couples staying for two nights and it was our first time in Marrakech Claudio took good care of us since arrival till departure. He offered a moroccan tea upon check inmeanwhile he explained all the activities we could do in Marrakech...preventing us about pros / cons in Marrakech.  Rooms are spacious and graciously decorated I know that some other reviews talk about the hot water...in our case the water was ok for both of us to take a shower. The only down side regarding the room is that there is no fridge no phoneno tv...  The neighbourhood is typical to get to this Riad you have to pass by a local market where they sell anything...kind of chocking the first time but nice.  Claudio cooks and prepares cocktails that can be taken to the roof terracenot many views but the skyline is acceptable....speciallly during prayer hours as there is a mosque just next roof....voices songsetc....very charming.    Bring your amenities such as toothpaste combetc as they only provide with the basics )shampoo soap conditionair towels)    For the rest just rely on Claudio's advise about the city and the restaurants ah and if you get lost in the Zouk...don't worry.you will find your way out...otherwise just tip one of the guys that will be harrasing you to guide you inside for some money (just agree on the price first),Date of stay: August 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Muscat, Oman",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Henk0383

Riad Mandalay,KathandBarry wrote a review Feb 2011,40,Nothing was too much trouble,Stayed here originally for 4 nights but due to snow and air traffic controllers strike our trip was extended to 12 nights!Georgia and Yassin were perfect hosts and the Riad itself is comfortable and on oasis of peace.After our first cancellation just a phone call to Georgia and we were able to stay a further 3 nights.Praise must be given to the meals we had there which were cooked by Claudio who was a delight to speak to and get an insight to Marrakesh.After our second cancellation as the Riad was full we moved to their sister Riad Al Warda which although smaller was a different experience but worth a stay.Special thanks to Valeria for being so helpful in every way,Date of stay: November 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KathandBarry
Riad Mandalay,rachellouiseturner wrote a review Feb 2011,50,"Beautiful riad in a great location, with friendly, helpful owners",Friends of friends recommended this riad and so we decided to go with it.    The location of it was pretty perfect - just around the corner to the Saadian tombs and the palace and about 15 mins walk from the main square so it was easy to the main action of the city but it was in a really quite little alley which was perfect for getting away from the hubbub of the rest of the place at night time. Having been picked up from the airport via transfer we did struggle to find it again after our first day of sightseeing as lots of the alleys look the same but once we got our bearings it was easy enough to find. If you have a phone with GPS on it though I'd definitely recommend taking it out with you to start with!    The people there were lovely – they gave us a great rundown of the best places to go when we arrived and were very helpful about answering all our questions over the course of the week.    We ate lunch a couple of times there and it was very nice - the chef is Italian so we mainly had tomato and mozarella or Morrocan salads or sandwiches which were perfect for the warm weather conditions. We also had a lot of mint tea which was delicious. Breakfast was mainly bread and jam and a Morrocan type of pancake.    The roof terrace was great for sunbathing for a couple of days and the two cats who thought they owned the place had real character.    There is no TV by the way so if you want an early night at all bring a good book or a pack of cards or something similar to fill your evening with.    Also their credit card machine wasn’t working when we were there so we paid in cash (although we could have made a bank transfer). Watch out that the quoted price is in Euros but you’ll pay in Dirrhams at the current banking exchange rate (not the rate used by the shopkeepers) which might work out a bit more expensive than you had planned for.    Finally bring some ear plugs because when the calls for prayer go off at the mosque at 6am it will no doubt wake you up - but that would be the same anywhere.,Date of stay: February 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Oxford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rachellouiseturner
Riad Mandalay,YakYakFatYak wrote a review Jan 2011,30,Somewhat disappointing,"I'm not sure previous reviews reflect our experience at this riad. We were pleased to be met as promised at the airport. Yassin then picked us up for a rather exciting car ride through the market to the riad. This was due to the extensive building works in the Kasbah which prevented taxi access and meant walking round the mosque square each day - not too much of a problem but unexpected. The riad is down a fairly wide alley very quiet at night but easy to find once you get your bearings so perhaps more accessible than some. But it was quite a way from the centre. We timed the walk to the main square - it's 20 mins through a local and somewhat industrial area (one of the roads was dedicated to motor repairs) but it was a straight flat and safe walk. We found it rather tiring doing this walk twice a day on top of all the other walking around - taxis are cheap (20 DH max) but it didn't seem far enough for a taxi most of the time. The weather in January is great warm to hot during the day cool at night. We found the riad too cool in the evening although the air conditioning warmed the room up quickly. The riad itself was as expected rooms set around a pleasant courtyard but perhaps not as luxurious as it looked online - which we didn't mind! We had the largest suite which was extremely spacious with a huge bathroom (yes some mould in the cupboards but not an issue). The main problem was that we paid extra for the room with the jacuzzi but it simply didn't work because it was impossible to fill the bath up enough - but we did receive a small reduction for this. A nice touch though was that shampoo shower gel etc is provided which is rare in riads and saves on carrying liquids. We had a very nice Italian meal with wine in the riad on our first night to save finding our way around in the dark and finished the wine on the second night. But be aware there is NOTHING to do in a riad at night - on our third night we came back to find it deserted with just one light on and it would have been so nice to have been able to buy another bottle of wine or have coffee and chill; instead we had to have an early night. The roof terrace is closed in winter too. Yassin and Georgia were very agreeable and friendly but perhaps somewhat perfunctory and pre-occupied. We were welcomed with the most wonderful mint tea and ""briefed"" on arrival but didn't take everything in at that stage and realised later that it left out some of the most useful things - where to change money the nearest ATM how much the tourist bus and carriages cost some info on shopping/haggling cheaper places to eat (the recommendations were all top of the range) etc. We booked our own trip to the mountains because we wanted something shorter and cheaper. I also booked a hamman in the riad only to find that too didn't work so ended up with a standard massage I could have had at home! So overall I don't think this riad was worth the premium we paid I reckon there would be plenty of similar but cheaper accommodation nearer to the centre - had we booked earlier! Ryan Air passengers may find it useful to know that online check in is not accepted on the return trip - we nearly missed our flight because of this and some delays with the taxi the riad organised. Oh and non-smokers beware you can smoke in all the restaurants and in the riad - fine for me as I've yet to give up!",Date of stay: January 2011,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Taunton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YakYakFatYak

Riad Mandalay,roshni300 wrote a review Dec 2010,50,"Amazing - Fun, friendly and easy-going.",My friend and I came from London and stayed at this riad. At first we both had reservations as pictures can be very deceiving. However we were pleasantly surprised. It was immediately amazing and left us in awe. We were greeted by Yassin (manager) and shown to our room; a delicately put together Moroccan dream. The Bathroom was large fresh and clean. The bedroom had two beds and enough room for both of our suitcases and clothes!  Yassin then gave us maps and useful information about the local area. Pointing out the best places to eat visit and relax in. We were given advice on the prices tours and much much more.  The riad has the most amazing courtyard with a pool. It immediately became a place that my friend and I spent a lot of time in. It was both relaxing and peaceful from the hustle and bustle of the outside world. The courtyard has comfy inviting sofas and armchairs which made relaxing easy. The pool was pretty and clean and depending on the weather great to get into.  There is a Wi-Fi connection and a laptop which guests are free to use. On one occasion Yassin offered to put on a movie for us after a tour to the Atlas Mountains really making this a Home from Home. That gesture in itself was outstanding and we both felt very much at home and welcomed. This level of service is something that would not happen at every riad & hotel.  The location of the raid is approximately about 10 minutes walk from the central Medina. It was easy convenient and safe. This is also the reason why on occasion we would go out in the evenings to enjoy the nightlife.  The riad had a very simple and filling breakfast as well as the most amazing coffee. Both Yassin and Claudio (cook) ensured that we both received breakfast in the mornings when we couldn't manage to get down in time. When we had to leave at 7am for a tour they also managed to ensure that breakfast was laid out for us. We also had dinner at the riad which was very good but the dessert was amazing! The tiramisu was to die for... their portions are also very generous.  The riad also features an elegant roof terrace which we used to relax on. The riad has the popular Hammam room within the property which meant that we could have treatments in the luxury of own home.  Yassin also organized the tours to the Atlas mountains for us saving us a lot of time trouble and money. This riad felt like an extension of my own home. By the time we left it felt as if the staff were family. The best bit about the riad is definitely the desserts and staff.  The worst thing about the riad... is that we had to leave. :(    All in all a very family friendly riad but great if you're also just coming with friends. This riad can accommodate for all your needs! I promise you that!,Date of stay: December 2010,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/roshni300

Riad Mandalay,globetrotter2124 wrote a review Nov 2010,50,Peaceful and Personalized B&B with Moroccon Flair,We really enjoyed staying in this oasis protected from the bustle of Marrakech but with all the old Medina sites nearby. It's located very close to the Saadian Tombs Badi Palace and other tourist attractions. You can walk to the famous Plaza Jenaa el-Fna and covered marketplace in about 10-15 minutes but you're far enough away to escape the bustle when you want to sleep or relax. It's just far enough off a main street to be quiet but close enough that you won't get lost like you might at other riads located deeper in the narrow alleys of the medina. It's pretty quiet at night although when people are talking or moving around in the courtyard it can be loud. I'm sure all riads would be this way.    The owners are usually around with a friendly face and helpful tips. They also book hammam spa treatments and massages. The massage was a full-body of excellent quality. We also had a dinner one night which was slightly more expensive but very romantic and quiet with just us there inside the riad courtyard and amazingly delicious 3 course meal. They do not sell alcohol here but you can bring your own.    Breakfasts were just bread butter and jam but with great coffee and great fresh-squeezed orange juice.    Free wifi if you bring your own device.    There are 2 or 3 cute cats running around the courtyard.,Date of stay: November 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Boston,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/globetrotter2124
Riad Mandalay,Londongirlz wrote a review Nov 2010,50,Beautiful oasis,We really enjoyed our 3 night stay in the Ryad. It is off a main road and there are narrow alleys to weave in and out of before getting to the Ryad. The Ryad is deceiving as it looks bare on the outside and is not named. Inside it is beautiful and comfortable (someone will show you the way). The Managers Georgia (Ms) and Yasin were very nice and hospitable with good English. Our children enjoyed having a swim in the very small pool (water was cold) and the staff were friendly though did not speak English. I would say take a French phrasebook. French is widely understood in Marrakesh. We had a large family room and the staff did their best to meet our needs as we had 3 young children. There is a nice rooftop to lounge on. Our family room was large with a big bathroom too. I wouldn’t recommend taking young children to Marrakesh (due to cobbled streets which are narrow and the Djema El Fna after dusk can be scary for them – a lot of walking here). Local people were very nice to us and in particular to the kids. For food its best to eat in the Café’s and Restaurants around the Sq we liked Café Letoile and from its roof you get a good view of the Sq. Cabbies try to rip you off so haggle haggle haggle and offer them a third of what they quote. The Ryad is near the Saadian Tombs and Bahia palace etc all which are a short walk. The main sq is maybe 15-20 minutes to walk to. We stayed the latter part of the week in a big hotel near Hivernage which is about 50 Dirham in a grand taxi to the Sq. Both offer such a contrast though all the action is within the Medina and hence I would strongly recommend this Ryad to others.,Date of stay: October 2010,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Londongirlz

The staff were wonderfully pleasant & helpful & it was never too much trouble to ask for anything. The breakfasts were delicious and were the perfect way to start the day. The riad's about a 20 min stroll to the square and it was lovely to come back from all the hustle & bustle & just sit & relax on the patio or sunbathe on the roof terrace at times we had the riad to ourselves & it seemed as though we were in our own little palace!

Riad Mandalay,MsAllen85 wrote a review Aug 2010,50,An absolute gem in the heart of the hustling city,My husband and I stayed at the Riad Mandalay in Aug 2010 for 4 nights.  We flew into the airport around 6pm so arranged transfers with the Riad owner Georgia via email For 15Euro this was well worth the money and the driver was waiting for us when we got through to arrivals. He even waited while we exchanged our £'s for Dh. The Riad itself would be quite tricky to find I think if you were alone as the alleyways are a little daunting if its your first visit but once you get used to them you do settle. We were never made to feel intimidated or unsafe while walking alone at night.  As soon as you step through the Riad doors you feel like you are in another city! You can't hear the hustle and chaos outside just the trickle of the pool water and the ocasional call for prayer from the nearby mosque.  Our room was lovely and the aircon was most needed in the high August temperatures!  Very clean and maid service everyday. Breakfast always freshly squeezed OJ and pancakes. Delicious. Staff were very friendly and Georgia was very helpful by giving us a map and some useful hints when we arrived.  The only thing I could mark it down for if I am being 100% honest is the sleep quality as the prayer calls can wake you up rather early!

Breakfast was lovely bread/jam/pancakes/coffee and set us up for days of sightseeing.  The pool is just what was needed for the heat and relaxing on an afternoon we had lunch as well on one day which was chicken kebabs salad and chips which was very nice.    The Riad is approx 15 mins from the big square and you have to walk through some amazing higgeldy piggeldy streets but it all adds to the excitement as you see much more of the real marrakech on your walks.

Riad Mandalay,ab0681 wrote a review Aug 2010,50,Glorious - Made me want to join TripAdvisor in order to review!,Where to start? Firstly Marrakech is fab I fell in love with the place. Nothing you read about it will compare to the actual experience.    Decided on staying at the Riad Mandalay after seeing very positive reviews on this website and so so glad that I did. We stayed for three nights and enjoyed marvellous weather wonderful hospitality and TRULY one of the nicest hotels that I have ever holidayed in. Simple (very different to 'basic') and wonderful.    The whole 'Riad' concept was completely new to me and I was initially nervous that it would be too small/ intimate (for various reasons including the fact that this was Morocco and I'm a bloke travelling with his boyfriend) but the hospitality that we received was second-to-none and immediately allayed any fears. The intimacy of the accomodation was one of the factors that made this a truly memorable holiday.    We had had arranged through the hotel to be collected from the airport in advance 15 Euros well worth it. The owner (Georgia) welcomed us on the first night with much needed refreshments (and her extremely knowledgable advice of where to go and what to do. She gave us an invaluable map and was on hand throughout our stay to give us whatever advice and assistance we needed.    The room was fabulous great air-conditioning extremely clean incredibly comfortable bed and beautifully decorated. Breakfast was lovely every day great pancakes and lovely fresh bread jams and coffee.    The hotel is also brilliantly situated and we didn't have to get any taxis during our stay- we easily walked (despite 47 degree heat) to all parts of the city from there. And the pool? What can I say much needed wonderful.    I have already given details of this Riad to my friends and I will certainly be visiting again in the not-too-distant future. Thankyou Georgia (and team) for a great couple of days wish I'd stayed for longer see you soon.    Alastair    P.S.

Approx 15 mins walk into the main square    Positives -  - Courtyard area of riad was gorgeous with a lovely pool  - Arranged taxi pick up from the airport (15 euros) for us which made saved a lot of hassle and return taxi when we left (10 euros)  - Arranged dinner for us in the riad on the night we arrived (200 dirhams per person) - was lovely 3 course meal with mint tea to follow and again was nice to arrive without worrying about going out straight away to find somewhere to eat  - Really good value for money. Our room was simple/basic but spotless and comfortable and was nothing extra that would have needed  - Nice breakfast in the courtyard every morning - bread pancakes coffee fresh orange juice butter and jams  - Feels like staying in a home from home rather than a hotel. Georgia the owner gave us a map when we arrived and drew out directions to all main sites. She let my friend borrow a phone charger which she'd forgotten and let us store fruit we'd bought in the fridge which I guess you wouldn't get with a larger hotel style riad  - Small lunch/drink menu (omlettes/salads) and food did have was lovely  - 2 of the cutest cats ever!    Negatives (only minor!) -  - Although we only ventured up there once as was too hot the rest of our stay the roof terrace was a bit of a let down. There was building work overlooking it (although you didn't hear any noise when in the courtyard) and the furniture was a bit sad and worn looking and no plants. Not sure to be fair though if this was as was so hot it was assumed no-one would go up there and maybe in cooler weather is maintained slightly better  - On one day I think myself and my friend were only guests staying there (or only ones I saw) and the owners and their friends (wasn't too sure who was owner/worked there and who was a friend) were out in the courtyard/pool and we felt 'outnumbered' and a bit like we were intruding in someone elses house and ended up going in and sitting in room instead (after checking out the roof terrace). Though having said this one day we had the courtyard completely to ourselves and was so relaxing and the other days was just the odd other guest there so not a huge issue at all but is just the other side of staying in a small riad I guess,Date of stay: July 2010,Trip type: Traveled with friends,glasgow,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/glasgow77

On our arrival at the airport there was a driver waiting for us. Taxi costed only 15 Euro payable in riad (not the driver) and I would recomend that solution :) We were welcomed by Georgia and fantastic mint tea on our arrival in riad. Georgia also sat down with us and gave us loads of tips in terms what to see how to move around and where to eat.  We used all her suggestions and we were not disappointed. It's good to know how much to pay taxi drivers and where to eat especially if you are not sure about how clean restaurants are.    We were very impressed with the style of this riad and how clean it was. It was a pleasure to come back to our room every evening after sightseeing.    Location is fantastic as riad is just 10-15 walk from the heart of Medina Djemaa el Fna.    Staff was really friendly and helpful. We were heading to Fes after our stay in Riad Mandalay and we asked for some advise where to stay there.  We chose the place that was recommended by one of Georgia's friend and again we were not disappointed.    I must say that this was a brilliant choice to stay in Riad Mandalay and I will recommend this place to anybody who plan to visit Marrakech.

Riad Mandalay,apriliamgt wrote a review Jun 2010,50,Perfect stay in marrakech,This was a perfect place and a great choice of riad to spend our time to relax after a long day in the busy centre of marrakech.    Georgia(the owner) was very helpful and couldent do enough to help us and was kind enough to provide us with a map of marrakech and all the places we should go and visit.    As this riad is down a little side street about 10minute walk from the main square it was quiet and a great place to chill out after a busy day.    Recommend this riad(hotel) to anyone visiting marrakech.    I will visit again    Thanks again Georgia,Date of stay: June 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Torquay, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/apriliamgt
Riad Mandalay,carlideal wrote a review Jun 2010,50,Hiding from the Hustle,Riad Mandalay is in the centre of all of the action perfectly located within the Kasbah region passing a mosque market and windy alleys to find it hidden amongst the local Riads and Shops. With a welcoming smile everything perfect from the breakfast to the dip in the pool or maybe even the lounging about the sun terrace. The only wake up call needed was the mosque at an unearthly hour but being in the centre of such a fantastic city is what it is all about being part of the community. The walks nearby pleasant fantastic for finding locations such as the Saadien Tombs and Bab Agnou (literally 2 minute walk from the Riad) to a little further afield (10 minutes) for Palaca Baad and Bahia or even the Jeema El Fna Square. The host Georgia set us up quickly with a map and a few helpful hints and even guidelines for pricing. Not something you would find in all of the other Riads or hotels within the area. Breakfast was substantial enough to get you well and truly on your way for the day. This was a perfect place to relax and stay away from the Hustle and Bustle whilst steal being within the city's beating heart.,Date of stay: June 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Kingston upon Thames, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carlideal

Riad Mandalay,Jan t wrote a review May 2010,40,A quiet white pearl within the crowded kasbah of the Medina,"We stayed here 8 days and it was just great. The personnel is very helpful! The first day we got a map with a detail explanation of the things to see within the Medina. The breakfast containing of fresh orange juice coffee bread pancakes and marmalade provided a good day start. The staff arranged the car rental for us and we could even have (pre-ordered) dinner at the patio of the riad. The riad is located in a quiet area of the Medina but still in walking distance of all sights. We stayed here with two children 4 and 7 years old and they have walked pretty much all off the seeings we did. The rooms offer all you need to get a good sleep. The showers are warm and the rooms have airconditioning for the warmer nights. We say ""thank you"" to Dex and Giorgia for their help and would like to recommend this riad to future Marrakech travelers.",Date of stay: May 2010,Trip type: Traveled with family,Doetinchem,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bdjantl
Riad Mandalay,Cloutman20 wrote a review May 2010,50,"A wonderful, relaxing haven from the crazy streets of Marrakech",We stayed in a superior double room which included a tasty breakfast. Upon our arrival we were greeted by a warm friendly welcome which included a hot cup of Moroccan mint tea to relax and unwind with after our flight. Georgia one of the owners was very helpful in pointing out nice places to visit in Marrakech during our short stay. Our room was nice and big with a huge bath/shower and a nice view over the courtyard. We only stayed for one night as we were off the the atlas mountains the next day but we made sure that we returned to Riad Mandalay at the end of our trip as it was so enjoyable the first night we arrived in Morocco. The Riad is only a short 10 min walk to the main square and in a peaceful location compared to the main hustle and bustle of the main square. I would recommend staying here.

Riad Mandalay,simoncia wrote a review Apr 2010,50,The Riad Mandalay: a real wonderful stay,Our stay in the Riad was really wonderful. Located at the very heart of the Marrakech's Medina close to all the most beautiful places to visit the Mandalay is a great opportunity also in terms of price/quality proportion. Giorgia (the owner) is a very kind and careful host and helped a lot also given the fact that we were two families traveling with two teenagers and three young children.,Date of stay: March 2010,Trip type: Traveled with family,florence,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/simoncia
Riad Mandalay,elliebengal wrote a review Mar 2010,50,Tranquility with-in full on Life in Marrakech with-out,"I'm an experienced traveller so took a chance on booking this off the Web. Some times you just get really LUCKY. Had a great stay. E-mailed ahead to be met at airport that worked like a dream. Had two evening meals there both were yummy. Next time for our arrival we will book transport and meal plus a massage for the following morning to make the most of our time. We were given a Map AND were Talked through the ""What's and Where's"" much better than the usual info. All the staff were friendly and helpful the other guests were too even thought we were the only English people staying at the time. The Riad is in the Medina so everything you need is on the doorstep but was peaceful once inside. We had such an good stay we are going back in October. Highly Recommend this Riad.",Date of stay: March 2010,Trip type: Traveled with friends,Doncaster,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elliebengal
Riad Mandalay,marcodonaz wrote a review Mar 2010,50,Riad Mandalay: the best place to stay in Marrakech,I was a guest for two nights in this wonderful Riad. It's situated in a quiet part of town definitely recommended after the chaos and noise of Marrakech.  A small oasis of peace and quiet the rooms are very clean equipped with double or twin beds. There are bathrooms in the room very elegant and spacious. The service is excellent especially thanks to the management of Giorgia who is very gentle precise and professional. Among the services included is the ability to use the hammam Jacuzzi and massage. The breakfast is excellent and plentiful: jams fresh fruit juices and sweet crepes. Special thanks also go to Tarek who made me a guide for one evening in the city.  Value for money is excellent I recommend you to write directly to the owner to receive the availability. If you are looking for a place that has the romance and magic of Morocco stop here will not regret it you can trust.

Riad Mandalay,yoyointheair wrote a review Mar 2010,50,"Great, Confortable & affordable riad in heart of Marrakech",A real atmosphere some huge spaces architecture with very nice and typical Moroccan interiors and details (musharabieh wrought iron white sandstone).  An awesome pool where you can relax after having hammam. I highly recommend spa and massage made by masseur and great handyman Tarek.  A very welcoming mixed arabic & italian crew.  A great terrace where to have a drink at sunset.  Many different places to chill out in the riad at different moments of the day.  All together comes to be a real great place to lay down and visit Marrakesh in the best conditions. I had a great time at Riad Mandalay with my girlfriend and I'll book there next time I'll travel to Marrakesh!,Date of stay: November 2009,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,paris,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yoyointheair
Riad Mandalay,Bowie4 wrote a review Feb 2010,40,Lovely place to stay and great location,We stayed here for 4 nights and had a really lovely time . The riad is very charming and relaxing. Eating breakfast (pancakes pain au chocolate fresh orange juice) in the central courtyard was a delight. Georgia and Tarek were very helpful and welcoming and actually very trusting as we had 2 kids with us 7 and 8 - so the noise could have been a nightmare! Actually the kids were fine abut a riad is not a place for really noisy children as the sound echos round!There 's a little swimming pool in the middle of the coutyard which my girls enjoyed (cold at this time of year!) We all had a go in the jacuzzi which was relaxing after day sight seeing. Our bedrooms (suite) were nicely furnished - nice white sheets and clean towels very day- we had 2 separate (conjoined) rooms which shared a little hall off a main door so it was perfect for us and the kids. I would recommend Riad Mandalay as had no complaints at all!,Date of stay: February 2010,Trip type: Traveled with family,Brighton,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bowie4
Riad Mandalay,Suz2010 wrote a review Jan 2010,30,Trip to Mandalay - good base for a visit to Marrakech,Lovely riad with friendly attentive helpful staff. The location is good and very quiet despite the noise a few blocks away. Good breakfasts. Rooftop is great for sun bathing or simply relaxing with a drink.    A couple of us got food poisoning at a nearby restaurant and Giorgia did everything she could to help us be more comfortable.    A few items need attention. The bed in our friend's room (newly but poorly installed) broke when they got in. The water pressure is quite low so showering can be a challenge. The drain is very slow so you're up to your ankles in water.    You can pay by credit card but you need to go across town to a second riad. Consider it anyway - I decided to pay by wire transfer and was charged a $40 fee by my bank!,Date of stay: January 2010,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Newtown, Pennsylvania",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Suz2010

But we were recommanded this riad through a friend and were glad we picked it. Giorgia Dex and Tarek were incredibly friendly. They showed us were to go were not to go an some other practiful info that came useful (taxi prices etc.).  The rooms are very clean the shower is hot and there is always a cup of mintea ready if you ask for it!

Riad Mandalay,kaprice06 wrote a review Nov 2009,50,Never change a winning team !,"5 super days spent at the marvelous Riad Mandalay in the Kasbha! Whole team - Giorgia Dex Tarek ... are just people to meet with! You'll be welcomed like at home and after just a couple of hours you feel like at home! And it's also a place where you can meet with other nice guests. Don't forget if you have time enough to ask for a personalised ""dinner tagine couscous party"" made by the pretty and magic Aminha. Try to find 2-3 other guests and you'll spent a superb meal. For good local red wine ask Giorgia to recommend supermarket where to buy.
