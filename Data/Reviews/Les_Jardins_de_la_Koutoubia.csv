Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,luxexpat wrote a review Mar 23,50,"Comfort, professionalism, tranquility",We spent a very happy week in this lovely hotel. Despite the fact that it is located in the heart of the city it is a haven of peace built around a beautiful garden filled with birdsong. The staff are very professional kind and welcoming. We were offered refreshing mint tea and biscuits on arrival. Our room was comfortable with a very good bed large bathroom sofa good television minibar fresh fruit and cakes daily replenished mineral water table and desk air conditioning and adjustable lighting. We could see the Koutoubia and the garden from our window. We chose to dine in the Moroccan restaurant with traditional music and dance and at the Imlil beside one of the pools. We also availed of room service. All the meals were delicious. Next time we will try the Indian and French restaurants and the rooftop pool and bar. There are comfortable loungers beside the pool and many peaceful shaded alcoves on the terraces. There is also a piano bar beside the cool and calm lobby. There is a brand-new Museum of Intangible Heritage in the former bank building on the Jemaa El Fna a short stroll away. The souks and many other interesting sights such as the Secret Garden and Dar el Bacha are also walkable and there are taxis a few metres from the hotel entrance for Majorelle or Guéliz. Return transport for the airport was arranged for us door-to-door. Check-in and check-out were fast and efficient. Thank you to all.

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,Jatinder S wrote a review Mar 10,50,Authentic Marrakech accommodation,The staff were very friendly and helpful. We were looked after by Yousef Hind and Moisin amongst others and everyone was very welcoming. The Riad is beautiful and traditional right in the Medina. It is hard to find down a long narrow alley one the only difficulty we had was that we had to walk some distance to get to where the taxis could come. This caused some difficulty for my wife in heels.,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Leeds, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sonny509
Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,WileyCoyote wrote a review Mar 7,10,Grasping and perfidious,I made a mistake with booking this hotel on Booking.com and LoveHolidays.com. This resulted in my husband being charged when he arrived despite my already having paid with the other company. This was pointed out very early in our stay and could easily have been remedied by a decent manager.    When this supposedly high end hotel was informed they had taken two amounts from us for the same stay and asked to help they gave us assurances they would resolve this over the 2 nights we had with them. And then when we returned to the UK have fobbed us off saying we need to contact the agent.    Whilst the mistake was mine I deeply resent the bare faced dishonesty and grasping attitude that means that the staff smile in our face messing you around for weeks with nonsense emails all the while knowing full well they are in effect stealing from you. Despite whatever rubbish they have told me my husband and I can see two separate payments on our bank statements.    So for anyone considering staying here it looks beautiful and enjoys good reviews but beware all the while it employs some perfidious and rapacious staff who are content to say one thing whilst doing quite another to take your money there is a risk that you will experience the same underhanded practise.    If you like straight forward and honest dealings you won’t find it here.  This has tainted the entire experience of this French owned hotel.,Date of stay: January 2023,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CMcMM
Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,wilhelmina wrote a review Feb 2023,30,Faded beauty,A great 3 to 4 star hotel if that’s what you are after. As a 5 star it falls short. Mini suite was spacious but nothing wow . Corridors dark. The pool area x2 were lovely. Based on the breakfast we chose not to eat at the restaurants.Boiled cauliflower  plain pasta is not my idea of yum for breakfast but each to their own.The housekeeping staff are so welcoming and friendly . The best . Location is good for the square.

We had a beautiful garden room with its own little seating area.  The rooftop pool was a lovely place to while away the afternoon after a busy morning exploring the medina.

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,carolineb wrote a review Dec 2022,50,Another excellent and charming stay,My daughter and I have just returned from another hugely appreciated stay at this wonderful hotel. It is perfectly placed to safely wander and dip in and out of the city sights whilst being a calm sanctuary to return to.  We love both pools but particularly appreciated the heated rooftop pool in winter and enjoyed our afternoons up there with stunning views of the Koutoubia mosque attentive poolside drinks service and delicious lunches at the truly excellent restaurant.  I would thoroughly recommend a mini suite with terrace or junior suite as we’ve had before. Both are spacious excellently appointed with stylish terraces overlooking the peaceful gardens and housekeeping is exceptional throughout the hotel.  The staff are the most consistently genuine friendly and helpful that I have come across. This was only our second visit but we were warmly greeted like old friends and felt genuinely cared for in a city which whilst exciting can be overwhelming.  We particularly appreciated the help of the head concierge Mr Abbsedeq absolutely nothing was too much trouble both before and during our stay. He has a complete  Can do attitude and tireless desire to get it right.  There is a charming slightly faded glamour about this hotel which coupled with the genuine warmth of the staff makes for an extremely relaxing stay for which we are truly grateful.

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,Robert H wrote a review Dec 2022,50,A Perfect Oasis!!,Having just returned from a five night stay I’m pleased to say this hotel was everything we hoped for. A place of calm away from the hubbub of the Medina the hotel is perfectly placed to explore Marrakech.  From its beautifully appointed rooms through to its amenities it really catered to our needs.  Special mention has to go to the staff and management though who made the difference. From the warmth of welcome and their interactions with the kids through to the surprise cake for my wife’s birthday we felt looked after every step of the way. Thanks very much and I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.,Date of stay: December 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Bristol, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/642RobertH642
Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,Noor A wrote a review Dec 2022,50,"Gorgeous stay, superb breakfast!",Stayed at this hotel to celebrate our wedding anniversary recently for 3 nights (mid December). The hotel is so fabulous. We were welcomed with mint tea and Moroccan cookies at the lobby.    Thanks for upgrading our room much appreciated since it was our wedding anniversary. They did not know about it so I guess we were lucky. We were shown around our room by a staff we didn’t like it how he was expecting a tip once he was done showing us the room. You could just know that he was expecting for a tip.    Another guy came upstairs and deliver our suitcases. He didn’t even expect a tip and just go once done.    The room is excellent we had the swimming pool as the view. The housekeeping came everyday and put petals on the bed for the first 2 nights. What a nice gesture.    Breakfast was just excellent! Really enjoyed it! Thanks for making our breakfast superb with the crepes eggs station fresh fruit juices selection of Moroccan pastries etc.    This hotel is situated in Jemma el Fnna it’s very quiet inside. But once you go out it’s a circus and completely different.    Went for a facial at their spa. Again excellent experience. But I didn’t like it how the lady waited for me to put on my clothes once done in the same room. She should have given me the privacy to put my clothes on after the facial. Herbal tea was provided after the treatment at the reception.,Date of stay: December 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/noora458
Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,Swisschilind wrote a review Dec 2022,50,Lovely property and wonderful staff,My husband and I spent two nights in this fabulous hotel early December. We were upgraded upon check-in from a standard double room to a mini suite which was beautiful (view on the Medina though was not very picturesque so we kept the curtains shut)....the room was very comfortable and spacious  with a separate living-room area and extremely well equipped bathroom. Much care was taken in decorating the entire suite with rose petals and towel art on the bed. The room was extremely well cleaned. We dined twice in the hotel (once in the Moroccan where the food was quite good and the ambiance and entertainment was very nice....once in the Indian where the food was good too)...the breakfast was excellent with a very nice choice of delicious and fresh food (excellent fresh fruit juice eggs cooked to your liking great choice of breakfast pastries etc.). We both had a massage and Hammam....the massage were somewhat disappointing though but the spa area is lovely. I highly recommend the hairdressing services (very reasonably priced and great service). The hotel is incredibly well located just a few minutes' walk from the Jema El Efna square...really in the heart of the Medina. The ride is about 20 minutes from the airport and cars can access directly the front entrance of the hotel if there are not too many policemen checking (otherwise you can get dropped off 30 metres off). Overall we really enjoyed our stay and found the staff delightfully friendly and cheerful. We booked through Agoda and got a very good deal. We are already planning to return with our four children in the near future!,Date of stay: December 2022,,Geneva,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Swisschilind
Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,Muhammad S wrote a review Dec 2022,20,Not Worth Your Money,For the amount the hotel charges you definitely do not get the value for your dollar (or euro). Our room was blowing hot air since we arrived and we were told the first night that there was a glitch in the system and the AC would work again. It did not work. We were then told that the hotel controls the temp in the rooms which was a complexly 180 from what we were told the night before. There are much better hotels with the same cost as this one and would recommend those instead,Date of stay: December 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E8422HYmuhammads
Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,o0bev0o wrote a review Dec 2022,50,Beautiful Hotel,Omg this hotel was amazing! 30 minutes from the airport and located walking distance to the market. Upon arrival we were greeted with a nice hot tea and then showed up to our room. Rooms were gorgeous and had a pretty view of the interior pool area. Free large bottle water and fruit for you too.    Hair dryer  mini fridge there. No iron. Bed was comfortable.    The Indian restaurant on site was delicious as well as the Moroccan one.    Wish we stayed longer so we could have really enjoyed the hotel more  and maybe in warmer weather.,Date of stay: December 2022,Trip type: Traveled with friends,San Diego,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/o0bev0o

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,CarolineM8198 wrote a review Nov 2022,50,Beautiful hotel in a perfect location right off the Medina,Really cannot fault this hotel. Rooms were beautiful and spacious the overall decor of the hotel was stunningly opulent and the service was consistently excellent. Also a plus in Marrakech was the rooftop pool so you could get the sun all day ( the main pool downstairs was quite shaded which is common with the typical style of buildings in Marrakech). Breakfast buffet was also fantastic with plenty of choice. The location is ideal as whist you are in the Medina vehicles are able to drive right to the door so no lugging luggage around the main square! Would not consider staying anywhere else next time am in Marrakech.,Date of stay: November 2022,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarolineM8198
Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,atontao wrote a review Nov 2022,40,very good 5 stards hotel close to jemaa el fna,Very good hotel located in a small street  2 minutes walking from Koutoubia tower and another 2 minutes walking from Jemaa El Fna.    Despite the street was always busy the interior was very quiet.    Pleasant lobby. Nice classical architecture. The central area is a large courtyard with a large swimming pool snack bar a billiard room a small business room and other rooms to read rest or talk. The moroccan restaurant and the piano bar also overlook this courtyard.    There was another very plesant swimming pool with snack bar at the rooftop. There is an indian restaurant located also at the rooftop and an european restaurant at the low floor.    The staff was gentle  polite and efficient.    My junior suite had good size. A well equipped bathroom (missing hooks for towels and a towl for the bidet however). Bathrobes and twels had good quality. The bed was King size and very comfortable. Minbar was ok. There was a Nespresso coffee maker and a safety box addequate for tables. On arrival there was a large fruit basket. The living oom had tow sofás and a table and the balcony(only partial view of the Koutoubia althugh it as advertized as “with Koutoubia view” ) was very pleasant and had two chair and a table. Lightning was good. Soundproofing was aceptable except at a certain moment of the moment when the guest at the upper floor arrived and every step from the upper floor was heard. Wardrobes had sufficient space but there was not a single cupboard in the room.    He TVs at the bedroom and living room were large but the channel selection was poor.    The wifi was poor very slow.    Breakfast was very good with moroccan and western choices (including bacon and ham unusual in muslim countries). The lady at the eggs cooking station was good and fast.    My experience at the spa was good with the massage but very poor with the hamman.    Summarizing a very good hotel with high standards at an excellent location (probably the best hotel very closet o Jemaa el Fna).    Value for Money was average (i paid around 550 euros for the junior suite for two with breakfast) however i would recommend this hotel due to its location and its high level.,Date of stay: November 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Madrid, Spain",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/atontao
Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,SyedLoughton wrote a review Nov 2022,50,Beautiful & Culturally Sympathetic Stay,My wife and I stayed 4 nights at this hotel in their Medina double room which comes with a sofa area and a balcony overlooking the blue courtyard pool. Tastefully decorated in North African style and colours. A great bathroom with separate shower bath and toilet. Loved the breakfast which included made to order omelette and crepe sections and French influenced bread rolls and pastries. The hotel is in the heart of Marrakesh literally a few minutes from the hustle and bustle of the Medina and the tranquility of the Koutoubia Mosque. Mid November was ideal time to visit as the temperature during the day was a very comfortable 22-27C.,Date of stay: November 2022,,"Loughton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SyedLoughton

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,Juliet D wrote a review Oct 2022,40,Lovely hotel close to the main square,Lovely hotel within a few minutes walk of the Médina but away from the hustle and bustle. The hotel has a kind of faded old world feel to it - it’s full of Moroccan decorations rugs and paintings which give it an authentic charming feel. We were welcomed with sweet tea on arrival and quickly checked in. We stayed in a Mini Suite which had a double bed and 2 singles a large bathroom and wardrobe area and a big terrace overlooking the gardens below. The staff were all very helpful and polite though we had a couple of instances within the restaurant where we struggled to be understood. We were on a B&B basis so ate breakfast every morning- it was good buffet style breakfast and the kids found enough to eat. We also ate once on the rooftop at the Indian which was really nice. The hotel has 2 pools - the main one in the central courtyard was a little cool but there’s another heated pool on the rooftop. I tried the spa and had an amazing massage (for much cheaper than I’d get at home). It’s a lovely hotel with kind staff lots of beautiful gardens and close to the centre of town. If it feels a little tired around the edges and less glitzy than a normal western 5 star I think this just adds to its charm.,Date of stay: October 2022,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/775julietd

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,Sara wrote a review Aug 2022,50,An oasis,Stayed for a week in the mini suite which I can not highly recommend. The room (2nd floor room 254) is stunning with a good size lounge area and balcony (double day bed) looking out towards the lush garden. The hotel boasts 3 swimming pools: rooftop ground level and one with the spa- underground). Pool areas are quiet and peaceful- a real sanctuary.  House keeping is twice a day. They left fresh roses on the bed and the bathroom everyday. The hotel has an Indian restaurant on the roof top and serves delicious cuisine. Throughout my weeks stay I didn’t eat anywhere else but here. The hotel also has other restaurants and snack bars. Staff ensure hygiene and cleanliness to paramount and this can be seen in and around the hotel grounds which are spotless. I need to give a special mention to the Head Concierge Mr Abdi/Abdul (sorry don’t know his full name) for all his help and guidance during my weeks stay. He arranged for tours suitable for me and my mum (aged 78) who has limited mobility and an English speaking tour guide. Our stay was perfect made by the helpful cheery staff at breakfast and the front door as well as the cleaners in and around the communal toilet. So pleased I choose this hotel for my stay. Jem Fanaa square is 3 minutes walk round the corner. Small touches made a big difference like the daily fresh fruit skewers delivered to all those around the pool at 4pm.,Date of stay: August 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/p54r4

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,Jayne H wrote a review Jul 2022,50,Perfect serenity right in the centre of Marrakech,We stayed here for 4 nights and wish we had had longer. It was absolutely beautiful and like something out of a movie. The reception guys were friendly and helpful and we were given a stunning room. We had opted for one of the cheaper rooms overlooking the medina and so glad we did. The street views were fascinating and always something happening. Breakfast was plentiful and sat in lovely surroundings. The pool area was well kept and clean and virtually silent ( the whole hotel is very well sound proofed). We ate in the pool bar area a few times and yes it was tourist prices but easy in the baking sun. In the evening all we had to do was step outside  walk a few metres and we had a huge choice of restuarants on the square. For being in the thick of the wonderful colourful hustle and bustle and being a few steps from taxis and shops you couldnt beat it. Then you walked into the hotel lobby and the calmness was amazing.

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,FionaP1 wrote a review Jul 2022,40,Good and bad!,Beautiful setting decor style and great if you want to be at the medina. Lovely staff but see below food fairly food great room bathroom clean and comfortable on all levels.    However if you stay in a pool room which has a lovely outlook you will probably not get any sleep!  There is no soundproofing whatsoever we had a group who stayed up laughing playing pool with crashing balls chatting drinking until 4 am  therefore all guests in bedrooms around the pool area has no sleep over these nights. The night porter was too weak to ask them to move or go to bed even after many many guests complained. Not a peaceful place to stay at all.  When the breakfast service starts or anyone goes for a swim again you’re up!    Noisy traditional music starts at 6pm which we enjoyed to begin with but gets repetitive and annoying when it’s every night and continues until 10.30 pm again very loud in the room with the balcony doors closed.    So beautiful hotel and Duty Manager Adul was helpful listening to our complaint we were compensated slightly but if you value your sleep don’t get a pool room medina side may be worse ask for quiet!,Date of stay: July 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FionaP1
Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,Stephen S wrote a review Jun 2022,10,Way Past its Sell By Date,In my 300+ reviews I have written only two negative reviews prior to this one. Here goes: All this property has going for it is location....period. The room was dirty. We showed the head of housekeeping a ledge in the bathroom and she said it was coloured marble....then we put a wet wash cloth on it and the 'marble' went away.  The Thai food on the roof restaurant was inedible (I am being polite after many visits to Bangkok) The dinner at the ground floor restaurant was Moroccan but bland and chewy. Not like Al Fassia and more expensive.  The GM was no where to be seen and when you asked to speak to him was was always 1) in a meeting or 2) Off site The person in charge was the head of public Relations....need I say more?,Date of stay: June 2022,,"Monaco-Ville, Monaco",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/159stephens

An easy walk to the medina and never any problem catching transportation within the city. Main pool and roof top pool both great. Also a pool inside where the spa is; my wife and I had superlative massages. Staff and service impeccable. In particular Bouiski the head of reception was accessible knowledgeable fluent in half dozen languages and guided us through the various adventures we sought.

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,Sajeda wrote a review May 2022,10,Beware of your money in this hotel,The holiday was booked through loveholidays. First mistake . The transfer system is really terrible even though we had upgraded to private transfers took the rep an hour to sort our transport. Hotel was all good happy smiles laughter . We were booked in 4 nights 9th may my birthday. A surprise trip from my children. Monday to Wednesday went okay . We were half board. Breakfast was okay  nothing really special. As we are British pakistani origin the food in all 3 restaurant s was awful the Indian restaurant food was full of salt and spices that were overpowering we never went back . The local cafes in the square were much more cheaper and better food . After 5 pm they hold a food market which we never knew existed until our 3rd night there. It was on this evening the 11th that my husband was still hungry due to not liking the food in hotel restaurant. Around 10pm we took a walk to see what we could eat in the square. It was the first time my husband decided to leave his money bag under our pillow in room  with British pounds in there we had morroccon money on us that we needed. Next day we realised when we were to exchange money that £120 had been taken  panicking the extra money that was in safe had also been taken £320 that’s when the staff manager and everyone changed. We were accused of wanting to claim travel insurance when we didn’t even have any . We were treated like petty accusers . My husband went to the police station to report the incident. There was only 1 English speaking officer which made it impossible to communicate with them . They took our number and email address but have heard nothing since. This was a nightmare holiday ruined my birthday and was £500 down . Was so disappointed in the hotel managers there was no compassion whatsoever of our situation. Would never go back there.,Date of stay: May 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Luton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annysfabrics
Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,PJ M wrote a review May 2022,30,Discrimination in 2022 Morrocco,Rare posture of the staff regarding what they wrongly understood as a different couple when we were 2 male friends in hollydays. As they thought it was a gay couple waiters at breakfast were rude. At the pool bar the fact of not being French was also a minus at the moment of getting food or drinks. A level of discrimination and even racism not admissible in an international 5 star hotel. Definitely a place not to go if you are gay or not French.

As others have said don't be put off by the busy street on arrival at the front of the hotel it's just a 15 minute taxi transfer from the airport and you are in the heart of the action just a few minutes walk from the main square and the souks and yet as soon as you step into reception you enter a different world...a beautiful cool calm oasis with extremely friendly and helpful staff who seem to work tirelessly to keep their guests happy. We felt we were in safe hands from the outset and could immediately relax and enjoy ourselves.  We had booked a mini suite with separate sitting room but were upgraded to a Junior suite which was smart spacious and well equipped and had a beautiful large quiet balcony with a view of the Koutoubia mosque.  We wanted to be able to dip in and out of the local attractions and restaurants but also to have some relaxing pool time in the sun. This worked perfectly. There is a large pool set in beautiful gardens in the main courtyard and a smaller heated pool up on the roof with stunning views of the mosque both were lovely to swim in and relax around. There were good restaurants by each pool and we enjoyed breakfast each morning in the peaceful poolside gardens.  We've been to Marrakech before and love the city but the hustle and bustle can get a bit much this hotel provided the best of all worlds for us we can't recommend it enough and will definitely return.,Date of stay: May 2022,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alanjohnb2018
Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,Bob C wrote a review Apr 2022,50,BEST HOTEL IN MARRAKECH.,We were going to stay at a very famous hotel when I came across Le Jardins de la Koutoubia on google. The reviews I read were all good and so was the location so I decided to book a Junior Suite for my family and I. We arrived quite early in the morning so we weren't expecting to check in till later. I was greeted by Abdellatif at the front desk. He advised that the room will be ready shortly and we were welcome to have some refreshments . We had barely finished out tea when Abdel advised our room was ready and we could check in. Very seamless and easy check-in process and the best part was the room we were given was huge  separate bedroom  lounge  2 bathrooms and an open verandah. WOW isn't close enough to describe how nice the hotel is and how amazing the room we were given. The hotel is Amazing  the location is Amazing and the Staff are Amazing. As you can tell we had a fantastic 5 days and Abdul was instrumental in making our stay a memorable one. 5 Stars to Abdul and the front of house team. Our first trip to Marrakech would not have been the same without his advice and recommendations. THANK YOU Les Jardin de la Koutoubia and Big shout out to Abdellatif.

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,umboom wrote a review Mar 2022,30,Not worth the price,Hotel was in super location close to the Medina with some beautiful architecture however they let themselves down a little by not keeping up wit the maintenance especially the electrical fittings.    Staff at breakfast/room service / cleaners were superb but the reception staff appeared a little abrupt not very helpful.    I would class this as probably a 4 star the hotel also caters much more towards French clientele. Could not provide adapter as they do not hold any also no tea/coffee making facilities in room.    The shower riser was only waist high so could not have a proper shower without having to hand hold the shower head    We paid approx £200 per night for a twin room and were surprised to learn that this did not include access to the in door heated swimming pool & they wanted an extra 20 Euros per person per use to use the pool    The service at the Indian restaurant on the top floor was poor & very rushed they tried clearing the table whilst we were still eating & then issued the bill one the bill was paid they started turning the lights off if you want a nice relaxed meal this in not the place food was mediocre for the price many more restaurants in Marrakesh which provide super food and service for a similar price.

We had arrived an hour early (despite French air traffic controls best attempts to route us the long way around) but our mini-suite was ready and oh what a fabulous room! Large luxurious well equipped and with rose petals everywhere! Lovely bathroom lounge area and a private outdoor terrace  Hotel itself is rambling but lovely. Very quiet despite being right in the centre of Marrakech. Two lovely pools including one on the roof that has the benefit of a gentle breeze. Comfortable sun loungers make it a pleasant place to relax either in the shade or the sun.  Restaurants very good serving a range of different foods. Also discovered vin gris which is rather good (apologies to any sommeliers for my appalling grasp of wines).  Gorgeous spa area underground. Gym small warm but perfectly adequate...let's face it you are unlikely to be spending much time in it!

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,Richard H wrote a review Mar 2020,50,Oasis of Calm,This was our first time in Morocco so we decided to look for somewhere nice with good reviews. We didn’t want a Western style chain Hotel and this place did not disappoint.    The immediate impression as you walk in is the coolness from the heat and the sudden transformation from organized chaos on the street outside to almost stunning tranquility. A lovely welcome drink of mint tea was served as we checked in and bags were taken to the room. The staff took time to show us around the grounds on the way to our room which was really nice. It was an older style room in décor but it gave it an authentic feel and my good lady got very excited when she realized we had separate loos and bathrooms. I was not allowed to trespass in her domain!    The bed and lounge chairs were really comfy and the room temperature was easily controlled day and night. Every day the ladies who cleaned our room provided us with a new style of towel folding and petal arranging. Not something we usually expect but a nice touch to underline the superb cleanliness of the hotel.    There is loads of space to relax outside in the large courtyard a haven for shade if you need some and there is a roof top pool and loungers with café if you want to soak up the sun.    We took breakfast each morning and it was lovely. Plenty of choice for all tastes with the usual continental style of cheeses meats pastries breads and orange juice constantly being freshly squeezed. We varied between al Fresco and inside seating during our stay.    The hotel guest relations manager (Sorry I forgot her name) was superb. She arranged a couple of tours by private car one local and one to the mountains. Do expect to be taken to the Tanneries and spice shops and do expect to be hassled for sales but if you have a strong character you can overcome this. We failed miserably. The tour into the Atlas Mountains was well worth it and we persuaded our driver that we had no desire to stop off at any markets Souks Shops or camels! He got a free lunch for obliging!

Breakfast was very good with just about anything you could need including made to order omelets or pancakes. The entire staff was friendly courteous and professional. We really felt welcome and special the entire time at the hotel. The room was wonderful. We got a basic room with a courtyard view that was surprisingly large.

It is in the style of a riad with two sections joined by a lane which has security staff monitoring it. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. There is a spa with a delightful indoor swimming pool (pay to use) along with two outdoor pools one on the rooftop the other at ground level in the courtyard. There are three restaurants (Indian - rooftop Moroccan - ground floor Le Relais de Paris which is in the second section). There is also an indoor bar which does snacks from 5pm and a snack bar at lunchtime and a rooftop sky bar. The rooms are spacious and housekeeping was superb. We booked through BA along with a private transfer (also via BA).

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,Faro22 wrote a review Jan 2020,50,One of the best hotels ever,I have searched for a nice hotel inside the Medina but I was a little afraid of reaching them walking at night. So I decided to stay in a hotel not far from the main roads that could be reached even by taxi. So I found Le Jardin that suprised me in different aspects: the inside patio is wonderful the room was cozy the breakfast was fantastic and the gastronomy options inside the hotel was amazing. There is only one complain about the indian restaurant: the first night there was a mistake in our bill that was prompetly solved by the manager (they charged two desserts that we hasn't ordered). On another night I invited my Family to have dinner with me (a total of 8 people) and I ordered 4 rice pots as side dishes. The waiter brought 3 and I reminded him about the missing one. He replied that he thought 3 would be fine. Everyone on the table was awared of the happening because I asked everybody if it would be ok. When the bill came there was 4 rice pots charged on it. Ok it could be a mistake - another one but ok. Then I called the marrocan hostess and said there was a mistake. She called the waiter and he told her that he had brought 4 pots instead of 3. She seemed to agree with him even my whole family witnessed the fact. At the end she decided to charge Just 3. The problem was not the mistake. The problem was to face 8 people against one. In a bill that costed us almost 2000 Dirham it would be not 40 Dirham the main problem. We decided for other restaurants during our stay. Even so the hotel was a great option and I Will recomend it.,Date of stay: January 2020,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Sao Paulo, SP",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Faro22

Its a 4 min walk to the Jemma El Fna square (main medina) and right across from the Koutoubia. The outside appearance is not flattering but once you're inside you forget the chaos outside and embrace the tranquil inside.  We ate at the restaurants and also used the Spa.

There are three great restaurants a Moroccan the best India west of Chennai and a great French Restaurant perfect for steaks. There are two pools with a heated pool on the rooftop.

This hotel is fabulous - right on the edge of the Médina in a mostly traditional style with 3 lovely pools including one on the roof. The staff can’t do enough for you and special thanks to AbelAziz in the breakfast room and Moroccan restaurant and Mohammed in the sky bar who both provided exceptional service. Great pancakes for breakfast! We ate in the Moroccan and Indian restaurants and loved them both - expensive by Moroccan standards but not by Irish. Very high quality food.  Loved our mini suite so much - beautiful decorated 2 massive TVs and great bathroom with separate toilet as well as a garden terrace. Spotlessly clean and spacious we could not fault it. Would definitely go back. Great value- there are some seriously posh hotels in Marrakech like La Mamounia but much preferred this. Our only small thing was trying to arrange a late checkout which we got eventually until 2pm for free.  Great location for the Soukh etc and easy to walk to new town. Just across from Koutoubia Mosque. Beware taxis are just determined to rip you off - always agree price first before you get in!

The safe however did not work and we waited in for over half a hour to get it fixed...in the end we just went out. Waiting staff here provide a good solid service but not overall that amazing. On 8th I visited to spa to ask about the treatment I have booked ...the woman on reception started to shout at me..I was in total shock ...NEVER in my 35 years of travel have I been shouted at by a member of hotel staff. I took my complaint immediately to reception where the spa manager came to see me...she said the woman on the spa reception desk was not there to deal with clients ..I questioned why she was on the spa reception not only on the 8th but took my booking on the 7th...I didn't get a reply..then the spa manager said I had misunderstood to which I replied that there was no confusion ..someone either shouts at you or they do not shout at you and I was quite clearly shouted at .. even writing this review I still can not believe how I was spoken to.....the hotel is close to the medina and we both enjoy haggling in the souks and found all shop keepers polite and playful when bartering which was great as we were a little weary before travelling here ...you do get a little harassed by tour guides but a simple no thank stopped them from pestering you further. We would like to say that 2 members of staff in the hotel were outstanding they were the customer relations manager who was always available especially at breakfast ..and the lady who attended the toilets near the pool...both were friendly and helpful and went the extra mile it is a shame that other staffing in the hotel were not as courteous.....A week before we travelled to this hotel we sent two emails and neither of these were replied to. We found out from the TripAdvisor forum that others who had travelled here also never had there emails replied to...this is rude and bad business practice. Overall we would not recommend this hotels as despite the rooms and grounds being pleasant there were too many faults that need to be corrected to make this a good hotel.

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,Celia S wrote a review Oct 2019,50,Beautiful oasis,We had a lovely week at this hotel from 27th September to 4th October. We arrived late at night so missed the tour but no matter. Our room (257) overlooked the front of the hotel which we rather enjoyed as we could hear very little but could look out on the madness from our tranquil space which was huge with a fully furnished living area and generous bedroom space. The Wifi was generally ok. The hotel staff were very courteous and helpful at all times  we had two guides (about £35 for 3 hours well worth it to see the Médina and main square properly and also to visit the Marjorelle gardens and secret garden by taxi and avoid the ticket queue in the heat. We walked to El Badi palace ourselves and had an interesting couple of hours there. The Atlas Mountains were well worth a visit too. We bought a rug for our living room and have no idea whether it was a bargain but we love it. We found the food in the hotel ok breakfast was a generous assortment but a bit monotonous. We thought the tagines in the Moroccan restaurant were very average the Indian on the roof had lovely views and atmosphere and the food was good  but our favourite was the French Restaurant which was lovely. We also enjoyed the ambiance of the piano bar in the evening although the seating arrangements were not really conducive to mixing with other guests. It was very hot during our week and we never had a problem finding a shady sunbed spot by the main pool which was how we spent most afternoons. All in all a very beautiful special week away in a beautiful hotel amid the craziness. Also we were able to use a locker in the spa and facilities on our last day as we had a late flight home which made our last day very pleasant!,Date of stay: September 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Todwick, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Catconkers

It is located in small side street with a very unpretentious entrance; however once you are through the doors it is like you have entered another world. The reception area is plush and the patio and pool are truly palatial. We were upgraded to a Junior Suite which was spacious with a large balcony. The whole vibe of the hotel is calm and peaceful and you have no idea that you are just a three or four minute walk from the bustling Jemaa el-Fnaa square and souks. Breakfast is excellent and can be taken either inside or on the patio either is good and the service like everywhere in the hotel is first class. The location cannot be beaten as most of the main sights (such as Palais El Badi and Palais de la Bahia) are within walking distance.  Do not miss the rooftop Skybar. Drinks are reasonably priced and the sunset views are spectacular.

I chose this hotel because I thought it would suit my tastes and needs. I was not disappointed! The lobby and common areas are in tasteful Moroccan style. Breakfast by the pool is a delight. There is also a rooftop pool with sunning area bar and lounge area as well as an Indian restaurant. All of which I enjoyed! The location of the hotel is perfect if you are interested in seeing the many sights in the Médina. My room and bathroom were very spacious and the hotel was quite quiet in the evening. The rain shower was the best I’ve ever experienced! I had a comfortable king size bed and a large flatscreen TV with a large variety of channels. WIFI worked perfectly in all areas of the hotel—inside or out. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I also took advantage of the very reasonable airport transportation to and from (10 € each way) and the hotel arranged a very good private day tour of another part of the country.

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,j1954g wrote a review Sep 2019,30,"SO MUCH POTENTIAL, SO MUCH FRUSTRATION ...","A central location the availability of two swimming pools and many glowing online reviews played a large part in our choosing this hotel for our week's stay in Marrakech.    On our previous visit to Marrakech in January 2015 we had stayed in an excellent hotel in the Palmeraie but had found this to be too far from the medina necessitating a taxi every time we wished to make an excursion into town. Les Jardins does indeed have an ideal location being halfway between the Koutoubia Mosque and the medina and not too far on foot from most sites such as the Bahia Palace the Kasbah etc. The hotel building is attractive (once you're off the street) with cool shady external corridors and nice planting of bougainvillea plumbago and Queen of Sheba vines.    We had booked a room with city views but were upgraded on arrival to a room overlooking the inner courtyard and its pool. The room was spacious with tiled floors a seating area a very comfortable bed (firm mattress which we like) and extremely generous wardrobe and shelving space with many hangers. The bathroom was large with much use of marble and mirrors. There was both a bath and a walk-in shower. Everything was kept immaculately clean by the housekeeping staff who also decorated the bed with rose petals both on our arrival and on every succeeding day. The air conditioning was relatively quiet and worked well.    We did have a problem with Wifi in the room - it rarely worked perhaps because we were at the other end from the hotel Reception. In Reception and at the rooftop swimming pool the Wifi worked well although it did sometimes lock us out meaning that we had to sign in again.    During our stay the weather was extremely hot - in the mid-thirties/nineties - and so we were very glad to have somewhere to swim each day rather than staying in a riad without a pool. Both pools have attractive settings. The large one in the ground floor courtyard is cool (in the sense of temperature) but pleasant and has a shallow end suitable for children. The one on the roof - from where there are good views of the Koutoubia and the Atlas Mountains - is smaller and very very cold in spite of the fact that the hotel describes it as a ""heated"" pool. We could never work out why the pool was so cold in spite of the air temperatures being so hot all of the day and most of the night ... Both pools could do with a little maintenance - the courtyard one has rough areas where the main pool meets the shallow pool; the roof pool has a line of mould about an inch deep under the decking and above the waterline. These faults are not visible from above but are very noticeable when swimming.    The pools are open from 8 a.m. but bizarrely they are still being cleaned later in the morning - at 8.30 9.00 and sometimes even later than that. Similarly towels are always not ready on the loungers. It seems to me that if you are running a business and you tell your customers that something is ready at a certain hour it should be ready then - not an hour or so later.    We had noticed that many online reviews praise the hotel food. Quite frankly we were disappointed by the food in both the Indian restaurant and the ground floor restaurant. (I have been travelling abroad for 62 years so it isn't the case that I only enjoy British food). It is certainly true that there is a wide choice at the breakfast buffet but on several mornings the bread rolls were so hard that we could hardly split them with either our hands or a knife. My husband had crepes one morning and they were stone cold. (This was because he took them from the ""stack"" - but the crepe maker did not offer to make him some fresh hot ones!) Some of the croissants were very dry as was some of the bread; attempts to toast the latter were useless as the toaster hardly works ... The citrus fruit is not cut in segments to remove the pith but is cut in circles so that the membrane and pith has to be eaten with the fruit itself. On a hygiene level I would suggest that food is cleared from the tables in the courtyard restaurant a little more quickly as I noticed a sparrow ""on a roll"" (literally!) on our first day.    Breakfast is supposed to start at 6.30 a.m. but if you want eggs or crepes at that hour you will be lucky as these are not available until quite a bit later when the staff responsible for making these items finally appear.    I think that our greatest disappointment was with the hotel staff. Here I must make a couple of exceptions and say that the pool staff on the roof work very hard and are most helpful in moving umbrellas as the sun changes position. Marie (who is the wife of the manager of the Indian restaurant I understand) circulates among the guests at the pool and is always ready to help with queries or problems. Otherwise we were not overly impressed. Some reviews mention that a ""welcome drink"" is served to guests on arrival; we certainly weren't offered one. We also had a problem one day with our room card when after breakfast we couldn't get into our room again because the card wouldn't work. My husband went to Reception and explained the problem. The receptionist took the card and put into a machine and handed it back without a word of apology. ""So it will work now?"" my husband said. Apparently it would - but it didn't as we found out when we went back to the room and tried it again. This time I went down to Reception and explained the problem again. A gentleman came back to the room and tried our card managed to open the door with his own card and told us that the problem was ""les pilles!"" (the batteries). Promising to call an electrician he left us. I'd agreed to take a friend out that morning so I left my husband to deal with the technician - and he waited and waited and waited .... and eventually had to go down to Reception for the third time to enlist a manager's help to see what was happening (leaving the room unlocked of course). Hardly satisfactory. As for providing a free transfer from the airport to the hotel and vice versa - forget it. We e-mailed the hotel on 13th July asking for a transfer and six days later on 19th July we had a response from Fatima asking for details of our booking. We replied the same day and waited for a reply - and waited and waited and waited ... and eventually had to book a transfer with a taxi company in Marrakesh as the hotel just couldn't be bothered to reply to us or to arrange a transfer. We run our own business and reply to all queries and business e-mails the same day even when on holiday! So many reviews say that ""the staff couldn't do enough"" - well for us that is certainly true - they couldn't even have the courtesy to reply to our e-mail or book our transfer!    For the reasons above I have given a score of 3/5 which I feel is on the generous side as I found some of the above so frustrating that there were days when I felt the hotel only deserved a score of 2/5.

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,Jess Littman wrote a review Sep 2019,50,Luxury in the medina,"Les Jardins is located very conveniently in the medina but just a block away from a main road and one block from Place Jemma al Fna which is an excellent landmark in case you get lost or need to direct a taxi. The hotel is luxurious with a huge pool in the courtyard and another pool on the roof. The roof pool deck has a view of the Koutoubia mosque and the bartender there makes a limited selection of excellent cocktails. The rooms are huge and very comfortable with beautiful tile floors. The decor is a little creepy (lots of close up photos of veiled women's eyes) but you won't want to spend much time in your room anyway with the lovely pools and bustling medina just outside. The spa is very lovely and offers a variety of treatments.    We only tried the Moroccan restaurant (the hotel also has Indian and Continental restaurants). The food was good but not the best that we had in Marrakech (for the best go to L'Ibzar). The breakfast was as good as a hotel buffet gets including excellent coffee and fresh orange juice.    While the Jardins is very nice it is a hotel not a Ryad. The smaller Ryads in the medina are former private homes now tiny boutique hotels. They are very charming and beautiful. The choice of a hotel vs a ryad is a matter of preference: the ryads are deeper in the medina and a bit harder to access; they may also lack some of the amenities of the hotels although I am not sure about this. On the other hand they may provide a more charming or ""authentic"" experience.    Note that while the street on which the Jardins is situated allows cars some taxis will refuse to drive into the medina at all. However you can see the hotel from the street corner with the main road so this isn't a big problem unless you have all your luggage - arrange airport transfers through the hotel to avoid dragging your suitcase up the street.    Also note that Moroccan hotels do not provide hair conditioner only shampoo.",Date of stay: September 2019,,"Arusha, Tanzania",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jesslittman

Three restaurants roughly Moroccan International and Asian all very good. A very large and delightful central pool is most inviting and there is a rooftop pool and bar as well. The Spa is excellent reasonably priced and the treatment we had was first class. The staff are very friendly helpful and efficient. We would come again in a heartbeat. A perfect place to base your stay. Thank you.,Date of stay: September 2019,,"Frome, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travel682
Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,drmingi wrote a review Sep 2019,40,Excellent Location!,The property was in an excellent location. Literally an oasis in a rather authentic working class neighborhood. It was about 300 yards from Jemma Fna and a 100 yards from the Katoubia mosque. Unfortunatelythe property has seen better days. The carpet decorations and paintings as well as the lighting and atmosphere really needs a major overhaul. I’m sure it was a grand hotel 30-40 years ago but now not so much. Also the food at the breakfast buffet was very ordinary and limited. The staff overall were very friendly and helpful. I just wished that the lady on the egg grill would at least smile a little. Overall a good stay and would recommend if you’re looking for an excellent location.,Date of stay: August 2019,,"Franklin Lakes, New Jersey",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drmingi

You can park your car directly in front of the hotel.    The rooms are spacious and very comfortable; the breakfast buffet is amazing; service is always kind and very helpful; and the restaurants especially the one on the rooftop is wonderful.

Situated less than 5 minutes from the Souks. Had a room overlooking the pool. Rooms roomy and beautifully decorated. The spa is a must! We experienced the Hamann which was great would fully recommend. The staff were very attentive but not too much and the melon by the pool at 3.30 every day was gratefully received. The reception staff were very knowledgeable and helpful. Would highly recommend having a private tour guide. The hotel arranged ours and he took us out for 3 hours.

The service from all of the staff is faultless everyone is pleasant helpful and they bring an air of calm to a bustling and vibrant city.    The food in the rooftop Indian fusion restaurant is to die for! Like it’s gorgeous! Mouthwatering curries and tandoors fresh naans and rolled popadums! So good!

Excellent location right by the famous square Jemaa El Fna where you should get lost inside the colorful souk and let it turn into an unforgettable experience. Back at the hotel you can treat yourself at their fabulous spa where the staff is not only very professional but also very nice! Then for dinner you have 3 restaurants to chose from but being in Morocco I went for the local food...it was delicious! ...For breakfast you have a fabulous buffet and you can sit around the pool listening to the birds!

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,32kate wrote a review Aug 2019,50,AN ABSOLUTE OASIS,"Having booked a double destination trip to Morocco and being somewhat disappointed with our first hotel in Agadir I was a little anxious about our hotel in Marrakech. What an absolute joy we landed in!! This hotel is exactly the moroccan experience we had hoped for.    Firstly on entering the hotel you get the feeling of absolute calm after the bustling movement and noise of the street (the hotel is literally at the entrance of the Medina). The reception staff quietly and quickly checked us in and at the very end of the process mentioned that our two rooms had been upgraded to mini suites.    The mini suites were anything but mini. From large bathroom kingsize bed three sofas to beautiful terrace furniture. A calm oasis within an oasis in wonderful colourful noisy Marrakech.    After our journey from Agadir we decided to rest at the rooftop swimming pool and bar (theres also a restaurant there). This was lovely but we later decided that the ground floor pool (outdoors) better suited usafter our trips to the Medina and souks. The pool area is just beautiful and the photos on this site do not do justice to it.    Breakfast was good but with less verity than other hotels but the setting was great. Also this hotel serves good coffee!! The hotel bar is actually a proper bar. Wonderful panio player and just perfect for a nightcap.    The spa is a must. I have been to many (generally book hotels with spas) this is probably the nicest I have been to next to ""destination spas"". Full marks. Even if a treatment is outside your budget just visit the pool and relaxation area.    The location of this hotel alone would merit booking but add that to the ambience discreet and most helpful staff and I personally feel you will not be sorry.",Date of stay: June 2019,,Ireland,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/32kate

Blurry water-no one to take your order  Business center:no telephone-not working computer keyboards-couldn’t check in.  Travel companion on heart medication caffeine strictly prohibited. Ordered decaf and brought regular coffee 3 times - the last one lying that it was decaf.  Also no chamomile tea  No coffee and tea making facilities no room complementary water all throughout stay.

Completely inefficient staff not speaking English at all definitely not earnest to help  Complained to duty manager did nothing  Complained to girl introduced as manager only to have her admit she wasn’t later on.  No general manager!  We had arranged airport pick-up through hotel and driver asked for money upfront. Told him it was through the hotel -we had no local currency and insisted because the hotel is outsourcing its rides with a taxi company (at 02:00 AM).  Breakfast: poor choice and iffy hygiene. Had to boil your own egg. Cheeses/hams were only half covered with insects treading all over.  Girl-manager tried bribing us (1 night free) to stop us from writing on TripAdvisor.

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,SozzyBear wrote a review Aug 2019,50,"Convenient, beautiful and welcoming",We pushed the boat out a bit when we decided to choose this hotel. After previously staying in a lovely riad a couple of years ago we knew that we would need a larger hotel for the pool but we did not want to sacrifice the proximity to the suqs. This hotel was perfect. The location was excellent close to the suqs and the many beautiful architectual wonders that Marrakech has to offer. On site there was a lovely pool to lounge around and we were even allowed to swim late night after a hot night out in the suqs enjoying a meal. OUr rooms were really lovely - clean and cool and with an adjoining patio balcony with our friends. Staff were friendly and nothing was too much trouble.

A gorgeous old style hotel with completely modern amenities this lovely destination has the charm of a riad but all the features (including three excellent restaurants and two pools) of a large hotel. I was utterly charmed by our room and the service was incredible. The location is also unbeatable - I was worried that by staying in the Medina itself it would be noisy but it was an oasis of peace and beauty.

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,BlondesHavFun wrote a review May 2019,40,"Beautiful Hotel, but lacks 5 star service",I really loved this hotel from the moment I walked in it was literally like a slice of paradise. Incredible decor very Moroccan - stunning ambience with a calm and tranquility that surrounds you as soon as you leave the Medina behind. The lounge/reception is beautifully decorated and through the huge doors facing you - you get an immediate glimpse of the gorgeous pool surrounded by lush greenery. Everywhere is quiet and peaceful.  The room was great - a nice size with LOADS of cupboard space and a larger than normal bathroom with double rainshower and large sunken bath. Everywhere was spotless and the huge king size bed comfortable and smelling of fresh linen.  Our view of the amazing pool never got boring. I really did love the scene outside my window.    Three very good restaurants - all part of the half board deal - so long as we didn't go over 300 Dirhams each.  This was possible with 2 out of 3 courses and no alcohol.    The Moroccan was very nice - tasty and hot traditional local food somewhat ruined by the continuous live musical accompaniment. It ended up sadly just sounding like a noise and one that wasn't entirely pleasant.    The French was divine - lush gardens lamp-lit private and very romantic. The food was good but not great.    The Indian on the rooftop was also nice with a fantastic view of the Koutoubia but not amazing food as I'd hoped. Rather average.    So now for the bits we didn't like:    Bad service around the pool. Waiters would bring a drink over to a customer on their sun lounger and then wouldn't ask anyone else around the pool if they wanted a drink. I found this behaviour rather odd. Surely at a 5-star hotel the waiter service is part of the experience? Especially in the baking heat. This meant we were forced to yell across to them hoping for a response or get up and go to the bar to place an order.    We complained about this several times but we noticed no difference whatsoever. Not good at all and this really let the hotel down. It didn't feel like luxury.    The food at the snack bar by the pool had so much potential. Nice menu good food choices but everything tasted of nothing. The salad was tasteless the pasta was flavourless the club sandwich was awful. And we were paying for it too.    The beautiful spa with the amazing pool and comfortable sun loungers was not part of the deal for hotel residents as they were charging 200 dirham each just to swim in it. I've travelled all over the world and have never been asked to pay just to swim in a spa pool. The hotel claim this is so it doesn't get too busy down there. Instead - because of their lack of judgement it is permanently empty instead. What a waste.    These little touches would have really helped to make the hotel top points for me.    Great choice of breakfast beautiful decor a haven away from the crowds and madness of the Medina (which is 2 mins walk) but just a few things they need to improve on.,Date of stay: May 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BlondesHavFun

We were shocked when we see how old non maintained the hotel is. The furniture is extremely old.  The flowers decorating the place is so non artistic  Breakfast choices are so limited.  When we checked into the room the carpet color was washed out the paint color is uneven multiple wall cracks and glue marks on walls seen. The handle of the shower was broken. The sink was not draining efficiently. The toilet seat is seated in a separate room with no sink near by available for after use wash while the cleaning chair is situated in another room!  Many other failures noted.  This is added to a difficult access entrance if you are renting a car.  We complained to the reception and asked to check out but the hotel refused to refund our money and offered us an upgraded to junior suite.  No much difference in space however a broken fountain was added in the terrace. When we went to sleep one of the bed lights wouldn't turn off again broken.  While asleep we kept hearing this unexplained noise that turned to be caused by the fountain pump because it lacked water.  For the first time in my life I sleep on such a hard mattress in a hotel.

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,fagen2015 wrote a review Apr 2019,20,Indian restaurant experience.,We arrived at the Indian restaurant at Les Jardins de la Koutoubia and were ushered inside by a very enthusiastic doorman and brought up in the lift to the restaurant on the third floor terrace. We were sat at a table that was chosen for us but we immediately moved to another that wasn’t in direct sunlight. We placed our order and while we felt were were being rushed through our meal the food was very good. We asked for the bill and on closer inspection we discovered that the entire itemized bill had been duplicated and we were being overcharged by about 80%. When we brought it to the attention of the head waitress she wasn’t particularly bothered or even apologetic from this moment on ... not as much as a smile or any apology was to be had from her whatsoever. Then the manageress came to our table and again offered no apology and it was as if we were being an annoyance to them. The bil was then amended and was handed to us by the head waitress again...still without any apology or even a smile. She then walked away...we got up and left with a very sour taste in our mouths. Double check your bill before leaving this ripoff joint. We of course did NOT leave ANY tip although we DID leave a tip for the young friendly waiter and told him that it was for him alone and NOT for the management.,Date of stay: April 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Dublin, Ireland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fagen2015

We arrived hot and tired after 2 days trekking in the Atlas Mountains and were warmly welcomed.    The room was amazing and the staff all lovely and kind.    From the reception desk porters bar staff and waiters. The service was exemplary. So thank you.    The location is a 3 minute stroll from the heart of the souk and a real oasis from the hustle and bustle of the Medina. Equally it’s a good location for exploring the rest of Marrakesh.    We ate in the roof top Indian restaurant which was delicious but also heard that the other restaurants were just as good. The roof top bar and piano bar are lovely. But our favourite spot was sitting by the open fire enjoying a bottle of wine.    Having been to Marrakesh a number of times this was by far the best place I’ve stayed.

I'd fancied a beer but alcohol is not widely available in the Medina.    I asked if non-hotel guests were allowed to have a drink at the bar and we were welcomed in.    There are nice velvet sofas indoor but better still plenty of outdoor seats adjacent to a palm tree surrounded pool.    Drinks are not cheap - 90 dirhams for a cocktail and 60 for a beer but when your choices are limited it doesn't matter! Spirits are more expensive.

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,kskwared wrote a review Mar 2019,30,"Great Location, Beautiful Pool, Average Service and Poor Spa Service",I've stayed at this hotel 5 times. I've gone back multiple times because the location is fantastic for easily accessing the tourist shopping areas of the Medina but yet it is removed enough that when you are inside the hotel it feels peaceful. It has two fantastic pools and the rooms are always clean and some of them are very spacious and luxurious (suites). The past two stays were somewhat disappointing and I'm not sure I'll return. During my most recent visit the hotel rooms were very hot and the hotel had not yet turned on the air conditioning for the season. I was staying at the room with another friend two female solo travelers and we couldn't sleep at all the first night. I contacted the front desk the following morning and was instructed to 'open our patio door' at night. I explained that we would like to move to a higher floor (we were on the ground floor) because we weren't comfortable opening our door on a ground floor at night. I was told the hotel would review the available suites and let me know shortly. When I returned that afternoon the front desk was completely unaware of the request I had made by phone in the morning and advised that all of the available rooms on a higher floor were checked into by newly arriving guests. They offered to turn on the AC for us which we gladly accepted. They failed to tell us that it would take 24 hours to actually 'turn on' and we spent another night unable to sleep due to the temp. We paid over 375 euro per night for our suite to me this is unacceptable at this price point and for this type of property. The following morning I complained again and they brought a standup fan into our room.    We also experienced disappointment at the spa during this trip. The visits all felt rushed and unlike during previous experiences we weren't offered tea or water after our services just taken to the changing room to leave. There is a lovely pool area in the spa that in the past was always nice to relax by after a treatment but the spa employees never offered it this time. On our 3rd day we called the spa to ask if they had any last minute massages available. They advised that the could accommodate us in 12 minutes if we could come now. We went down to the spa and when we arrived they explained that they only had 45 minute massages available. They said they mentioned this on the phone but it is possible I missed it as it was in French and I am not a native speaker. I was fine with a 45 min massage but my friend preferred to reschedule for another day when she could have a longer massage. When she mentioned this the staff became visibly annoyed and scolded her in front of other customers for taking up their time and canceling an appointment at the time it was meant to start. She explained that we had just made the appointments 12 minutes before and apologized. She felt very uncomfortable and declined all other treatments at the spa after that incident. We instead went to the spa at La Maison Arabe and the friendliness of the staff and calmness of the facility were a significant contrast.    The location and pool of this hotel truly make the property. The breakfast is also lovely if you arrive early - towards the end it gets messy and a bit chaotic. After we paid so much money and didn't sleep for 3 nights and then had such an awkward encounter at the spa I realized that it is sadly time to find a new go-to hotel in Marrakech.,Date of stay: March 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,kskwared,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kskwared

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,travaller11 wrote a review Mar 2019,50,In the centre of Marrakech,My family and I spent four days in this magnificent hotel in Marrakech. When we arrived the employees took immediately care of us taking our baggages and leading us to our suites. We booked two junior suites(composed by a large bathroom with toiletwide shower and a bathtub a bedroom with a big and comfortable bed and a tv and a living room) and when we got into the rooms we remained completely stunned: the whole room was full of scented rose petals and in the living room we found some delicious sweets accompanied with a lot of fruits.  The breakfast is located in a typical Moroccan place and it is just fantastic: you can find everything you’d like to eat from the salty to the sweet as crêpes with Nutella or tasty omelettes.  But the best is yet to come: in the hotel there are three swimming pools the patio one the spa one and the roof top one.We fell in love with the patio one surrounded by palms and every type of green. Opposite the swimming pool there was a lounge furnished by amazing Moroccan furnitures and a beautiful and detailed fire place a perfect place to take the sun or just chill out. The roof top was characterized by an amazing swimming a pool and an astonishing a view of the Koutoubia tower. Going around the hotel my family and I completely felt the Moroccan vibes in fact the hotel could be perfectly described as a typical Moroccan riad. The hotel executive a gentle and cuddling woman helped us to find the best places to visit in Marrakech and the best restaurants to eat Moroccan specialties as tajines or cous cous.  This holiday has been one of our best ones thanks to this amazing hotel. We recommend it to everyone because it’s 2 minutes on foot far from the great Jemaa El-Fna square and even because without it we couldn’t feel the Moroccan culture and style!

Was a little nervous after reading some reviews of the city but not once did we feel unsafe or harassed- a polite non merci and a smile was all it took to be left alone!  The hotel was fabulous excellent location - don't be put off by the scruffy outside trees! This is a very well run hotel where all staff were friendly and polite. We changed our money at the hotel they booked a horse and carriage ride for us (£15 for an hour) . The hotel is very close to Jemaa el-Fnaa and all the action lovely to hear the call to prayer from Koutoubia Mosque which we could see from our hotel room. We had a fabulous room looking into the courtyard/pool loved listening to the birds! Everywhere was clean room was spotless - bedding and towels changed daily (despite leaving towels hanging up to reuse they were still changed everyday). Excellent breakfast choice- only busy morning we had was the Saturday with the hotel being full. We were on a bed and breakfast basis and ate out most of the time but when in need of wine with our meal ( most of the restaurants we went to did not serve any alcohol) we ate at the Relais de Paris Imlil and Les Jardins de Bala restaurants always finished our evening in the piano bar for a night cap ( excellent staff  remembering my drink without having to be told!). Be aware smoking is allowed in most bars/restaurants in Marrakech- not a problem if seated outside!  We booked 3 treatments in the Spa and sadly have to report it wasn't the best we've experienced- it was ok. It felt like the staff were just going through the motion of giving a massage or the Hammam and in no way connected with us. The spa itself is lovely and you can use the pool in there when booking a treatment. Maybe the staff we met were just having a bad day!  We preferred this hotel to the smaller Riads  lovely areas to sit and relax excellent roof top pool and seating areas great views from the roof terrace. It is not an old hotel it just has the feel of somewhere old and relaxed -shabby chic  - it was great to be able to sit in the bar kick off your shoes and put your feet up to listen to the guy playing the piano.  Be aware it is cold in January and you need coats for early morning and evening but when the sun came out which it did everyday the temperature was perfect even for sunbathing and swimming in outdoor pool ( we had blue skies and no clouds for 7 days) .

The hotel is down a narrow street which has small local shops etc on both sides of the street. The hotel has three floors which are all accessed by modern lifts or alternatively by stairs. There are three swimming pools one in the central courtyard one on the roof terrace which is heated and one in the spa (which we never used). Plenty of sun beds around both outdoor pools and towels were supplied at each. There was also waiter service for food and drinks at each pool.  We had a room upgrade to overlook the central pool and it appeared that our room had been recently refurbished. Bedroom had adequate wardrobe space large double bed (probably larger than king size) settee and coffee table facing wall mounted flat screen TV. Electric kettle and cups were supplied on request by reception.  Bathroom was good with walk in shower with rainfall shower and hand held shower head plus there was always hot water available.  We did not try any of the three hotel restaurants as we stayed on B & B so we could eat out locally. The breakfast menu was a mixture of continental Moroccan and western (ie bacon and eggs) with fresh orange juice tea and coffee.  Local ""restaurants"" are good and not expensive but sometimes the Moroccan translation of food was not quite what we expected but it was always good!  The restaurants or food stalls in the main square can be a little fraught and noisy but that is a matter of choice.  The main square and market are a 5 min stroll from the hotel.  If never been to Marrakech before it can be a bit of a culture shock at first but it is safe and you quickly get used to it!

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,Jane R wrote a review Dec 2018,50,A perfect Oasis to stay,We had a junior suite with a gorgeous terrace and if we stood up could see the incredible Koutoubia and defintely hear it which is a haunting incredible sound - you step in from a pretty scruffy street just off the Souks into a very traditional hotel - lots of red velvet marble local furnishings and met by hugely courteous helpful smiley staff - our room was super comfortable housekeeping excellent and room service very efficient - overall I feel the property is slightly in need of refurbishment but still easy and comfortable to be in - the best part of the stay was the amazing outdoor pool like a warm bath form early morning to noon comfy sunbeds and great pool bar and snack service with an outdoor restaurant beautifully laid - so welcome after a day in the Souk. A roaring fire in a traditionally beautifully decorated open lounge a lovely place to relax and drink cocktails - magical at night when the grounds are lit. Breakfast could not be faulted incredible choice and freshly made omelettes crepes just delicious. We didn't try the hotel restaurants as there are so many choices close by - but they looked good. A lovely relaxed stay - not for those wanting a contemporary hotel - this is a lovely traditional easy and relaxed stay for any age,Date of stay: November 2018,,"Stratford-upon-Avon, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janerS7604XC

There was a wonderful choice of cereals fruit pastries and with pancakes eggs/ omelettes cooked to order. We ate in two of the hotel restaurants which were superb and with great service.

The rooms were really nice and the service as well.  What could be improved was the restaurant I tried (there are 3 in total in the hotel) : French restaurant is soulless. The reception is not always perfectly organised. But people are nice and really trying to help when you ask.

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,847nicole wrote a review Aug 2018,40,Luxury in the heart of old town Marrakech,2 couples in 2 neighbouring rooms: stayed for 5 nights in this hotel and were delighted at the luxury and attentive service we experienced here from the taxi transfers to room cleaning to poolside and restaurant service. Couldn't fault it.  On arrival you are greeted with refreshing scented flannels and mint tea flamboyantly poured by one of the waiters whilst the reception staff process your documents. We were give advice about booking a registered guide when first visiting the locality because of unscrupulous practice and they arranged one for us. We also booked through Fazir the owner of the hotel's taxi transfers for a day's taxi and guide to travel outside the city which was the best thing we did. He was punctual and reliable to the second with every journey.  Our rooms were upgraded from exterior street facing to interior pool facing and I would recommend this for the views and ability to put wet clothes on windowsill to dry. (Although there is laundry service at a reasonable price but we didn't use it.)  It is on the edge of the old town down a little road opposite the main Koutoubia mosque of Marrakech: and only round the corner from the start of the souks and medina (large market square with market stallsperformers cafes and restaurants taxis horse and carriages tuk-tuks etc).  All of the old town is full of character and chaos and a must see but is also labyrinthine a bit intimidating and rather squalid in places so the hotel is literally an oasis. Taxis can't bring you to the door because the road is cordoned off but it's only a couple of minutes walk away from where they can drop you off.  The first time you enter your room be prepared to be delighted at the creative rose petal patterns on the bed and around the bathroom features. These were changed and rooms cleaned twice daily! Lovely touch.  The rooms are large air conditioned with huge comfy beds and a large shower bath and sink in the ensuite bathrooms with all the towels slippers bathrobes and toiletries you'll need for your stay: replenished generously daily. Hairdryer and digital safe were great too. Plenty of drawer and hanging space. No kettle or complimentary drinks but there is a mini bar and room service. I rang down for an iron and had an iron and board delivered within half hour which I kept in our room for the duration of our stay.  We chose bed and breakfast rates and loved the choice available: fresh crepes and  omelettes made to order with the usual cooked breakfast items on a buffet. Also with a nod to the overt French influence: a range of pastries croissants jams and cereals with a colourful array of delicious fresh fruit. Orange juice and hot drink orders were taken at the table.  We also ate lunch at the poolside bar a few times and tried the Moroccan and International restaurants there due to visiting on an annual Islamic festival that literally closed Marrakesh for a few days around our visit. Perfectly pleasant but expensive for what it was rather limited in choices and underwhelming food. We ate far better value and quality food in the new town (Guillez).  Helpfully the exchange rate you get at the hotel is very good compared to some other places we initially used. And the reception was always manned  so we only exchanged stirling as we needed which was very convenient.  Some of us visited the spa for a traditional Hamman massage: the girls couldn't have been nicer and more professional taking us on a tour of their facilities. To use the spa pool you have to pay £20 extra: which we thought was expensive and it was cold and dark so we didn't use that again.  The main pool is lovely: plenty of beds seating areas and shades with towels replenished as people leave. It was very busy and there was a bit of bed reserving going on but we managed to find somewhere every day at some point.  The upper terrace pool was too hot for us( temperatures reaching 42 degrees!) but had a more intimate setting.  Great facilities service and experience all round.  Just one irritant: when settling our room bill we were charged around £6 a day per room for tourist tax which we hadn't realised was required.,Date of stay: August 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Newbury, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/847nicole

The hotel is exceptionally clean. Beds are comfortable too!  The hotel was magnificent all the way.  Service was good and housekeeping is exceptional. We felt very welcome here - The staff are very friendly.  Had a massage at the Carita spa - which was very relaxing.    I would give a little feedback... as there are two pools I would recommend the smaller rooftop be adults only where couples can enjoy a relaxing time 😉  The breakfast could be improved with more choice. Lacked ‘international’ type food in my opinion. I ate fruit (which was quite limited) and toast daily with only one choice of brown bread or white. For three days the only eggs available were boiled! Our final day however there was plain omelette available.  Despite feedback I would definitely come back here. The location is perfect. It’s relaxing and very authentic. And just a short stroll to jemaa el fna square that can be explored by day and night. Also close to other main attractions too.

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,kash42017 wrote a review Jul 2018,20,Poor service - check your bill!,Naturally we were looking forward to our mini family escape. We had booked a 5 star hotel (as per the travel agents ratings (4.5 stars on trip advisor). Our flight was at 6.10 am and due to land in Marrakesh at 9 am with transfer to hotel.    When we arrived at our hotel that’s when we experienced our first issue. We were told to wait in the reception as our rooms were not ready. We thought okay we don’t mind waiting a bit though everyone was exhausted after having been up all night finishing packing ironing getting ready arriving at the airport for 4am and being on a 3 hour flight. But hey we are on holiday so what if we weren’t able to get access to our 5 star hotel room bed for a little while longer?.... but how long is acceptable?    We didn’t get our room till 4:30pm. We sat around on 2 seater sofas for almost six and a half hours! Ridiculous!!! And that didn’t end there. Our kids were supposed to have the adjoining room. We were told that room was still not ready as the previous occupants had not yet vacated. An hour later I went to reception to tell them that we still didn’t have the kids room and I wanted to make a complaint. As soon as I said this the receptionist said that the room was ready and that they had ‘forgotten’ to inform us. He handed me the key card for the room. Had I not come down to complain I’m sure we all be sharing that one room 😡.    Unfortunately it didn’t end there. I’d specifically phoned the hotel when I was in London to ensure my kids room had two single beds. Upon arrival I again reiterated the point and the reception had said that it was noted. Yeah. They had a single double bed. Down I go again to complain. The receptionist seems surprised and said it’s noted on our booking that it should be two single beds in the kids room. Add on another 45 mins before they adjust their room with the two single beds.    When we did get our room the floor was filthy. We had to ask the reception desk to remove the rug in our room. It really was that bad. By now we are shattered.    A few days after arriving I was unfortunately taken ill. I was in bed for two days both days I couldn’t get much sleep due to the building work on the third floor next to the Indian restaurant. Constant drilling and banging.    On checking out we were made to feel like criminals! Not only did they get our bill wrong saying we had ate at a restaurant that we didn’t even visit they didn’t even apologise for their error when they could find the receipts that they claim we had signed. They then also accused us of taking items from the mini bar which they also admitted was a mistake. No apology and no ‘thank you for choosing our hotel’    The overall stay was average but only two stars as this is a service industry and thus they are judged on their service. Poor.

This hotel promised to deliver just what we needed and we were not disappointed.    For a fee of 780 dirhams we were rewarded with a generous pool and loungers a two course lunch and an hour-long massage. The waiters were attentive and the setting is simply beautiful. It is within easy reach of the main square and we were able to walk it from our Riad easily. The day pass allows you access to the spa and pool and the facilities are simply stunning. The massage was lovely too very refreshing.    Lunch was two course included in the fee. Dessert was amazing. Drinks were at extra charge but at 180 dirhams for a bottle of wine they were reasonable prices for a hotel setting in Marrakech.

Fantastic location within a 2 minute walk of the main square in the heart of the medina. Walking in from the bustle of the street the contrast is breathtaking. Grand period reception looking onto a glorious pool/garden area full of shrubs trees and flowers - a beautifully attended oasis surrounded by a striking period building. Further pool area on the roof with great views and atmosphere.  Rooms stylishly furnished and spotlessly clean - we stayed in a junior suite looking over the inner courtyard but rooms on the outer side overlooking street might be less appealing?  Stylish dining areas - particularly for breakfast around the inner courtyard. Good breakfast selection.  Super Indian restaurant at roof level.  Staff all friendly and efficient.

This hotel is strategically located in Marrakech. The hotel features not only beautiful rooms in Morocco’s style but also two restaurants two swimming pools a beautiful Carita Spa. I had a great Morroco’s Hammam and my girlfriend had a stunning linfatic-dren treatment.

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,AJasperB wrote a review Jun 2018,40,Beautiful hotel in good location,The hotel amenities were great especially the rooftop pool and courtyard toward the rear of the hotel. It’s only a 2/3 minute walk from the main square.    The restaurants were pretty good with much of the food being served buffet style. For a few meals breakfast notably it was quantity over quality however.    Also a very minor gripe but worth flagging for anyone staying here: I was charged for the bottled water in the minibar at the end of my stay despite being told otherwise by staff - at a 5* hotel in a country where tap water isn’t sanitary to drink you’d think this’d be free!    A staff member also tried to make me pay my tab for a second time as I was exiting the hotel after checking out. I had to find the colleague I dealt with earlier to persuade him otherwise!

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,Bobby G wrote a review Jun 2018,10,Got scammed by someone in the hotel,"As we left the hotel one day someone Infront of us as we were walking turned around and asked us if we recognised him.    It was the hotel reception steward. His name was either Muhammed or Abdullah (can't remember now). Anyway he was wearing plain cloths and said he'd finished his shift and was on his way home.    He asked us where we were going and we said we were going to a thanery (leather factory).    We'd just got the directions and details from the front reception but this guy now told us that they'd made a mistake; the thanery closes at midday as the work is too laborious in the heat.    He insisted on showing us something else and walked us 10 minutes to somewhere where someone else had tried to scam us before.    People in this country can be very forceful and they take advantage of our polite and affable western demeanor.    As we had a chance of bumping into him again at the hotel we followed him so as not to appear rude.    When we got to where he wanted to take us it was just a shop selling the same rubbish at every other stool.    In fact several street people had already tried to take us to this shop already so it's abundantly clear that they get money for every person they bring there.    As he left us in the shop he shouted to the shop owner in Arabic that after his shop the shop owner should send us on to another shop just next door selling argan oils (why?)    We walked around the shop so as to be polite and when trying to leave the shop owner accosted us and tried to find out why we wanted nothing.    What a strange question. Why don't we want anything? - By this point I was getting quite fed up of these people's switch personalities from friendly to unfirendly as soon as they see that you're not likely to be a paying customer so I just asked him back why he thought we'd want any of this polished antique knives candle holders leather bean bags or tea sets.    He then tried to take us to the oil shop and when we told him we didn't want to go he asked where we wanted to go.    We said to the main square and he said there was nothing in the main square.    What nonsense. The main square is the main attraction!    By this time I was ready to punch the dude so I just said curtly that there was nothing in the Argan oil shop either and we left with a bitter taste in our mouth.    Anyway - after this we made our way to the thanery leather factory that the girl in reception had given us a map for.    Turns out this guy from our hotel lied to us. It didn't close early! It was open literally all day! The guy who 'accidentally' bumped into us in the street had just lied to us to get us to go to the shop he wanted to take us to which we didn't want to go to.    I'm really let down that our five star hotel would expose us to something like this.    I knew Marrakesh was dodgy and that's why I paid well over the odds to stay in a five star hotel.    I expected they'd be doing everything they could to protect us from these sort of stuff - but as you can see they didn't and actually if I can comment two things about the hotel;    They didn't give us any real induction when we arrived.    1.) No map of the area or of the hotel. I only found out when we left that there's a nice Indian restaurant on the roof as well as some beautiful gardens with a beautiful view over the city. Such a shame we never saw them!    2.) We didn't get any sort of induction or orientation about the city and there was no invitation really to come and ask either. Whenever we did ask we received not cold but not ever so warm responses and it was always very to the point. It was some way through the holiday that was asked about the thanery and then found that they had a map of the city.    Finally - if I'm going to give a full summary;    I saw a bird eating from the breakfast buffet and I shoo'ed it away but the staff saw it as well and they did nothing. They didn't change the food nor did they shoo away the bird.    I wonder how often that happens and how many five star paying customers are paying over the odds for food that the birds have already pecked at.    On the last day our waiter at the breakfast was so rude he couldn't bring himself to say anything to us other than to clarify what it was we wanted.    Our ""thank yous"" fell on death ears.    And finally; if you've got gluten intolerance and or diabeties (like me) then you will only be eating rice tomatoes and cucumbers for breakfast.    Everything else is very sweet fruit and bread.    So to conclude: the hotel is nice but the people running it are just the same as the people in the street. They're gutter folk.    BUT it's probably the same all over Marrakech so it's probably as good as anywhere else.",Date of stay: June 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bobbyg316
Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,Nigel B wrote a review Jun 2018,50,Great central location,The hotel was in a central location. We had a mini suite and it was worth the extra money. There are two pools and the service was great from the staff. A good tip to seeing Marrakesh is to have a guided tour. We arranged this through the hotel and it cost 300 dirhams. All of the tour guides must be registered and there are lots who are not. They have either a red or green badge.  The food in the hotel was good and the service pleasant. The hotel offers a transfer service and it was very good and cost 10 euros each way. You do not need to change any money prior to your trip as you can change your own currency in the hotel or in the local exchange kiosks. The exchange was the same everywhere.  Just remember to take a pen with you to complete your visa entry into Morocco at the airport.

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,J Blair H wrote a review Jun 2018,50,Urban Oasis,Marrakech was the first Arab city I ever visited. All of my research told me to prepare for an assault on my senses. The hotel is in heart of all the sites and sounds of the old city; a short walk to the city center and the Medina. Upon my arrival I was greeted with a warm greeting and a offer of mint tea. I originally reserved a room facing the pool but was told I was being upgraded. My room was a large suit with two TV's a lounge area kingsize bed granite everywhere in the glass enclosed bath and very nice art works. it also had a very nice enclosed deck with glass doors opening to the garden. It was beautiful and quiet. For a first time visitor to Marrakech the environment can be beautifully frustrating and fascinating simultaneously. All the sounds smells throngs of people and continuous pressure to engage in trade can wear on you after a few days. But yes; this is why I came to Marrakech! After a long day of sightseeing and negotiating with merchants the hotel is a tranquil respite from the plus of the city. Excellent multiple dining options are from a French bistro to Moroccan fine dining. The desk staff is very professional and helpful and all the cleaning staff must have been sent to charm school.

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,Sarahjo33 wrote a review May 2018,20,Good location but poor service,We arrived late at night check in was smooth but nobody told us where anything was in the hotel would of been nice to be shown where the restaurants were and the spa pool etc. We found the room and it had been decorated nicely with roses and rose petals on the bed and in the bathroom. The bed was large and comfortable and the bathroom a good size. There is a mini fridge that did not get cold a flat screen tv with only one English news channel a safe in the wardrobe which worked well. In the bathroom there is complimentary bath products but no conditioner for the ladies and these were not replenished every day there is a hairdryer for the ladies to use. Unfortunately the drains gave off a nasty smell in the bathroom and the sink was not cleaned very well. Towels are changed daily as was the bedding slippers were provided and dressing gowns. I did feel that rather than dressing the room with roses and petals every day it would be better to just do this on the day of arrival and spend less money just providing guests with complimentary bottles of water. There is plenty of storage space for clothes and plenty of plug sockets for charging.....remember your round pin adapters!!  The WiFi only worked in our room if we sat in the toilet it did not work anywhere else in the room although it worked ok in the public areas of the hotel.  The breakfast was uninspiring and the service was poor the toasters are pitiful and you need to stand for at least 10 mins to toast your bread as orange juice was served by staff and not left out for you to help yourself this did not get filled up during breakfast and glasses were small. For a 5 star hotel the breakfast needs to be better and a bigger selection of food available.  The restaurants are expensive and not 5 star again service was slow and you did not feel comfortable. The food mediocre and needs to be improved.  The pool area is nice and tranquil however the pool service is dreadful and if you require food or a drink you have to go in search of staff they are slow and don’t bring the bill when you ask to pay. We got so fed up waiting for the bill one day that we ended up leaving and going back to our room the next day the waiter had the cheek to say we forgot to pay the day before even though they ask your room number when you order so they can bill it to you room anyway. The sun beds are comfortable but need a pillow we kept asking for a second towel to roll up and use for a pillow there are parasols to use also. The spa is very nice no complaints there.  We did ask the concierge to send someone to look at our air conditioning 4 times as it was not working but this did not get fixed so we gave up in the end and wedged the window open with a cushion every night. The lift is temperamental and although you press the button nothing happens and it does not arrive ok for us as we were only on the first floor but felt sorry for the people higher up we assume that the staff were using the lifts and overriding them. The toilets in the pool area are ok but you are given flannels by the attendant to dry your hands on and then we observed her drying them out in the sun to be reused.........I didn’t want to use these again so opted for my own tissues........not a five star thing to be doing!! We also left some money on the coffee table in the room and went out on our return this was gone it wasn’t a lot of money so we didn’t kick up a fuss but be mindful that all valuables should be put in the safe whilst you are out we assumed it was the maid and she might have been under the impression that it was a tip but in my mind the room staff are tipped on the day you leave the hotel.......hence we did not leave a tip on our last day. We only got a turndown service twice and had to ask at reception for more loo roll and clean towels. The hotel is in a good location if you want to be near the main square and markets just a 2 minute walk. We do feel that there are lots of improvements needed within the hotel.....  Some gentle music piped at the pool area  Improved WiFi in rooms  Improved cleanliness in rooms  Pillows for the sun beds  More English channels on the tv in rooms  An introduction to the hotel on check in  Better food options  A vast improvement in the attitude and speed of staff  Complimentary bottled water in the rooms  If the improvements were made then I would be happy to say it was 5 star......at the present time it is certainly not,Date of stay: May 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Leicester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sarahjo33

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,NZlvr wrote a review May 2018,40,Tranquil luxury in the heart of Marrakech,This hotel is lovely but with one glaring fault.    We stayed here for 8 days on our honeymoon and were given a room upgrade to a junior suite which was lovely. The hotel itself is beautiful tranquil well maintained and we loved the rooftop pool! It is however also situated not even a two minute walk from the Medina which is amazing. Our room was made up beautifully with rose petals every day as well which was a lovely touch.    We enjoyed the breakfasts - though if you want toast be prepared to stand by the toaster for 15 minutes (they are useless!) but fresh fruit pastries omelettes and crepes made for you are delicious.    The biggest let down at this hotel is the service sadly. In fact we were very often made to feel like we were a nuisance. I haven't ever stayed in a 5* or even a 4* like that. At breakfast we would probably have say 3 plates each for cereal fruit toast etc we would end up just piling everything in front of us because no one would take it away as it was used. Last morning we were in fairly early (7.30am) breakfast wasn't busy and we just got totally blanked by the staff. I had to go and find someone wait for them to stop talking to the other waiter and then ask if we could have some drinks. My tea came and was luke warm so requested another... all of these things were slammed down on the table in front of me without a word or smile. It's actually the younger members of staff who are more polite and once they came in they actually said good morning! We also had dinner in the Moroccan restaurant our last night again poor service not very friendly and we ended up spending really quite a lot of money on a pretty poor meal with poor service it was really disappointing.    Finally I would say watch your belongings... I put most things in the safe but left a pair of earrings out which consequently went missing. I never blame maids for anything I think it's unfair but my earrings were left in one place and were no where to be found. Luckily they weren't really expensive however they were one of my favorite pairs :-(    It was a real shame for the money we paid the service really was pretty poor.

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,Nelsa Abreu wrote a review Apr 2018,10,DO NOT GO: Atrocious attitude from the hotel manager,"We went into the hotel for a look around and saw they had an Indian restaurant where we decided to eat. There were a lot of problems with the food served completely cold and taking too long to come back to the table. We tried complaining to staff in the restaurant but were told the manager was in France there was nobody to complain to and that we should just be happy with our food.    Getting nowhere with the restaurant staff we asked to speak to the manager of the hotel. We went with one of the waiters to reception where a few minutes later a tall guy in a suit appeared who claimed to be the hotel manager. He was extremely rude from the first minute of seeing us saying that he didn't manage the restaurant the restaurant manager was in France and we needed to come back next week. I said I just wanted to explain what the problem was and he got right in my face and said ""I don't care what your problem was it has nothing to do with me"".    I asked for his name he refused to give it to me because he said it had nothing to do with him. He started shouting (seriously) and being very aggressive. The waiter from the restaurant was equally shouting and aggressive by this point and we got a phone out to video them as I have honestly never in my life seen service like this particularly in a hotel which claims to be a 4/5 star. The manager then tried to grab the phone from us he said ""This is Morocco you are now going to see how nasty things can be in Morocco"". He wanted us to hand over the phone saying it was illegal to video anyone in Morocco.    It was honestly like a scene from a comedy film this guy had clearly had zero training in how to talk to customers. We never once refused to pay we just wanted someone to hear our complaint.    There are so many lovely Moroccan staff working in hotels throughout the country it is a shame that Jardins de la Koutoubia employ someone who is so completely terrible at his job. It suggests to me that the probably pay very little manage their staff very badly and that this guy is probably the only one they can get.

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,TennesseeGypsee wrote a review Mar 2018,30,"Good Location, Standard Service & Room","Honestly this was our least favorite of five stays in Morocco. We wished we were in a small ryad instead.  This hotel is quite large very impersonal and nothing much to write home about.  Our room was a generous size included a small living room. There were very few places to plug in phones/computers and we had to crawl around on the floor and unplug floor lamps (that is something that is surprising in a hotel that is trying to be 'detail oriented'.)  There was absolutely nowhere to put toiletries except balanced on the bathtub edge (that is a personal pet peeve).  The view was of a pool with people lying out; the ryads we stayed in all had lovely views of towns or courtyards.  The location was fine. It is walking distance to the main square but we were told by our guide not to walk there alone at night. The street it is on is filled with garish loud shops.  If you are getting dropped off or picked up by car it is extremely difficult for cars/vans to get into the deadend street and out again. One night it took us 15 minutes to drive the short distance out due to delivery trucks parking and blocking the whole street.    *(Just as an aside if you are choosing places to stay in Morocco--skip Marrakesh. It is the only place that had lines to get into gardens and monuments and the medina was filled with Chinese-made cheap products half the authentic products and producers are gone. In addition the rude snake ""charmers"" and henna ladies will grab you and make you pay for photos. We couldn't wait to leave this city.)",Date of stay: March 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,Tennessee,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TennesseeGypsee

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,Andrew M wrote a review Mar 2018,40,Excellent location,This is a fantastic hotel with a typical unassuming front door from the bustling street side. Once inside the hotel is tranquil and feels a million miles away from all the sensory attacks you encounter in the busy streets of Marrakech.    All rooms either face out or into the courtyard where the pool is. Ask for a room facing in as they are much quieter. Several restaurants to choose from an excellent breakfast and a great piano bar with a wide selection of local and imported wines and spirits.    We had a suite which was effectively two rooms they had knocked out the wall and connected. We had a bathroom each one with a shower and one with a bath. Well appointed rustic feel to the rooms and warm and welcoming staff.    Location is excellent as you can literally walk outside and turn left or right and you're very quickly into the main square with snake charmers and food stalls and shopping in the massive souks of Marrakech. Take a guide these souks are a maze and easy to get lost. Also watch out (particularly ladies) when you're in crowds watching the performances in the square pickpockets and overly friendly local men!,Date of stay: March 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Beecroft, Australia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andrewmP7899IF

The breakfasts are a great feast and set you up for a day of sight seeing.  The roof top terrace and pool offer splendid views of the medina and Koutoubia mosque and should you tire of this pool there are another two pools to consider at the hotel.  Food at the restaurants are of excellent quality and have varied menus catering for all tastes.  We had a room overlooking one of the pools which was light bright spacious and spotlessly clean.

Rooftop pool has sun all day. An oasis away from the noise of Médina. Call to prayer and tweeting birds will wake you at 0530 and 0630 respectively but no issue. Great service - we had mint tea brought to the room each night. Use gym - one running machine is good - all the rest of the kit is ropey! Spa and hairdresser used - good value. Cocktails with pianist each night - kids felt grown up. All this inc supper one night in the Bala curry house and lunch a few times and the extras bill was £400. Great value I think. Two gripes; check out was PAINFUL. Not prepared didn’t know the facts and a little incompetent. And we booked an 0730 cab for the airport and it didn’t show up; had they booked it?

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,Ian595 wrote a review Feb 2018,50,Great hotel - authentically Moroccan.,We stayed at Les Jardins de la Koutoubia for a week in February. The hotel is comfortably furnished and decorated in traditional Moroccan style but it has all the facilities which one expects from a modern hotel e.g. free WiFi throughout. The location is very convenient with all the attractions of central Marrakech within walking distance. The hotel encloses a large sheltered courtyard containing the main comfortably heated swimming pool. The pool is clean and pleasant with plenty of sunbeds. There is another pool on the roof terrace and a third in the SPA. Rooms either face the courtyard or as our did the street. However the street is quiet at night. We were upgraded to a mini-suite which had excellent facilities with both shower and bath. It was warm comfortable and very clean. We needed to use the heating as the weather was cold. The hotel has three restaurants and we ate in them all. The main Moroccan restaurant serves breakfast and dinner. The breakfast buffet has plenty of fresh and dried fruits cereals and delicious breads and pastries. Egg dishes are cooked to order and are good. Dinner is mainly tagines and kebabs. It's not always clear whether your tagine will contain vegetables couscous or just the meat - so ask before you order. The French restaurant Relais de Paris has has an excellent menu and delicious food and is very well run. Absolutely the best value for money. There is also an Indian restaurant on the roof terrace; its menu and the food are fairly standard. The bar is pleasant and serves alcohol (not always available in Morocco). The hotel staff are efficient and friendly and take a genuine interest in their guests. We had an enjoyable stay and I have no hesitation in recommending Les Jardins de la Koutoubia.,Date of stay: February 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Southampton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ian595

To sit down there having a drink and listening to the piano player/singer brings you back to old times when people like Orson Wells and the like frequented Marrakech. All you are waiting for is Hercule Poirot coming in to take his afternoon tea or night drink...  Service is very nice as well as the whole atmosphere of relaxing on the search of the lost time.  This place is good for loading up for the drums of El Fna and it is as good for relaxing after an exhausting evening in the medina of Marrakesh.  Highly recommended.

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,raws_91 wrote a review Jan 2018,30,Not our best choice,"My husband and I spent 6 nights at this hotel.  My overall impression: They can do better for a 5-star hotel.    Check-in: Fast served tea and snacks. Upgraded to a mini suit (thank you!).    Room: Moroccan themed which was wonderful. However it seemed old and not very clean. For example the shower bidet was spotted and not very clean. The bathtub had an old dried spot. The rokm didn't have this overall ""clean and hygienic"" impression that normal 5-star hotels had when you first entered.  They had a huge closet towels bathrobes and other bathroom supplies were avilable.  - No tea/coffee corner. Water bottles not supplied.  - Fruits upon arrival in room.  - No iron in room    Laundry: Fast (given at night and received in morning). Clean and smelled good.    Spa: Good experience clean. I had a whole body massage. My only bad experience is that the masseuse didn't smell nice especially when massaging my head and face. Not too expensive either around 600 MAD.    Breakfast: Awful. Limited options for a five star hotel! Same dishes every single day. A small table for cheese products and meat a table for cereals veggies and yogurt break and croissants and eggs/bacon/steamed veggies/sausages/meat. And a lady who does omelette. It's a very tiny section.    Pool area: Heated pool but we didn't go for a swim. There's an area with a fireplace next to the pool that was cozy and great for chilling. There was also a closed room with a pool table and tv.    Other comments:  - Reception area was nice to be honest. It had a Moroccan theme.  - Check out: We waited for a while until someone came to get our bags. They did provide us with a taxi.  - Proximity to other areas: It was next to the old souk and Djama'a Al Fena. More modern shops were 30 minutes walking distance. We did not use a taxi a lot we walked all the time.    N.B In the photo of the bed kindly note that it was made for the purpose of taking a photo not by an actual staff member.

Breakfast was good with lots of fruit bread and juices plus a fresh omelette cooked to order. Ask for a room overlooking the swimming pool! The front of house staff were very friendly and helpful. The hotel organised a tour guide to investigate the Medina which was well worth doing (less hassle) and we visited some very interesting nooks and crannies that as tourists on our own we may have missed (town bakery lotion and potion shop with argan oil and so on). The spa/hamam in the hotel is perfect for a hard day as a tourist! There is a two day treatment that my friend and I enjoyed hugely (having the dead skin removed by a good rub down by a loofah on a marble slab and sloshed with warm water!

That said on entering the hotel you suddenly realise the quality of the reception area and the hotel itself.    The staff at check in were very courteous and helpful and ensured my room which was a Junior suite was ready even though it was only mid morning. Also on departure I was able to keep my room till 2.30pm without any cost.    The buffet breakfast was excellent and was available in the downstairs restaurant or on the patio terrace. Once again staff service was very efficient and the range of hot and cold foods was vast with plenty of different drinks to choose from. Also breakfast was available till 10.30am so no need to worry about early starts.    We also eat in the hotel Indian restaurant which is situated on the roof of the hotel. Once again first class staff service with food to match and great views.    Other facilities we used was the hotel spar which had a wide range of treatments at sensible prices along with the patio bar on an evening. The bar has a great feel to it with both background music and live entertainment on the weekend. The bar shuts at midnight but on the Saturday evening we found the waiters happy to serve drinks well past this time    The location of the hotel is ideal for everything in the centre of Marrakech with the advantages of being able to get to other places in the city very easy    I would have no problem in recommending the hotel for a business trip or a holiday getaway. I hope to get back to Marrakech very soon and this hotel will be my one and only choice when booking my trip.,Date of stay: November 2017,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Harrogate, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/520barryf

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,Amanda M wrote a review Nov 2017,50,Leisure trip,My husband and I had a wonderful stay at Les Jardins de la Koutoubia. It was our first trip to Marrakech and the hotel location could not have been any better. Located just a short walk from Jemmaa el Fina (the main square) it was ideal for our needs during stay. The room was spacious and very clean. The hotel also offers 2 pools- one in the courtyard on the ground floor and one on the rooftop which is heated. Interesting layout in terms of the WC not being in the main part of the bathroom. Hands down this hotel delivered in terms of location price and service versus the riad we booked for the end of our stay.

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,Ikkani wrote a review Oct 2017,40,impressive classic hotel,A big hotel with a very interesting interior. Stayed in one of its suites the room was very big with a separate living room. a big painting hanging on the wall. The service was excellent. Foods were amazing. Very close to the famous traditional night market Jemmaa el Fina. From my room I could hear the noises from the market. One drawback is that the hotel way is very narrow and it is surrounded by small vendors and shops. Another concern is safety due very large crowds around the hotel particularly at night.

The hotel suffered a fire on the top terrace which has resulted in the Indian restaurant to be relocated on to the terrace which has the roof top pool. Beds are in short supply and space is abit tight. This only a temporary situation has work was nearly finished on the new restaurant.

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,PeteD60 wrote a review Oct 2017,40,Anniversary treat......,We had booked a taxis from airport via hotel for 200 Dirham – met just outside terminal – easy journey until entering the medina when traffic congestion hit home – arrived down a narrow street to find unassuming entrance to hotel    Once through the doors the experience began – check-in formalities included form filling mint tea a sweet cake and back to the desk – some whispering followed and then it was announced that we had been upgraded from booked our mini suite to a junior one – then followed a trek from the old hotel through what appears to be a narrow street to the more modern extension to the room overlooking La Palais de Paris restaurant – thank you    We stayed in room 77 – otherwise known as Les Palmiers - first floor junior suite - for 5 nights from 11 October 2017 – set in its own block with a room below – as a result it was generally quiet    Being a junior suite it was spacious with a separate sitting area with flatscreen TV and what looked like a working fireplace – separated by a curtain is the spacious bedroom with very large firm but comfy bed opposite hanging and storage space with another flatscreen TV – separate toilet – very large bathroom with walk-in shower – good flow generally well controlled with decent toiletries and large soft towels – outside there is a terrace with deck chairs an awning and curtains for privacy    The air conditioning worked well and could supplemented by a ceiling fan - the passworded wi-fi did the biz and passed the newspaper download test – there is a decent size fridge and an Nespresso coffee machine offering expresso sized portions – there was a turn down service on 3 of our 5 night stay which was appreciated    Breakfast is served on the ground floor next to the pool – egg and pancake stations plus extensive hot and cold buffet – good coffee and juice served to the table – however during our stay service levels dipped and became erratic – fewer items were replenished – coffee arrived cold more than once    There is a bar and alcohol is served throughout the building which is not the case in many places elsewhere – whilst it is reasonably well priced it can’t beat supermarket prices – there is a Carrefour within a 15 minute walk away just past the Cyber Park – the alcohol section is extensive and is on the lower floor – well worth the walk    We had a guide arranged by the hotel – 300 dirham for about 2 hours’ worth of guiding and chat including stops at perfumery and carpet shop – good introduction to the Souks and the history of Marrakech and Morocco and its relationship to the wider political world and Islam – for first timers like us we got a very good introduction and enabled us to better understand the guide book    Where we ate more often than not in the hotel – best food was provided by the lunches – good choices and tasty – dinner less so especially in Les Jardins de Bala – we did eat dinner outside the hotel – Kit Kif – did not disappoint with great views across to the Mosque – Portofino – safe European option – and the Red House which was a good experience    The hotel is in a very central location within the Medina and within easy walking distance of Place Jemaa El Fna and the Souks but still directly accessible by car which many of the Riads are not    Drivers in Marrakesh appear to follow a Highway Code that defies understanding and especially in the Souks you have to watch out for motorbikes and cyclists who are threading their way through the crowds at speed    In the main the hotel was a good choice for what we wanted - the room was well appointed quiet and comfortable – the restaurants offered choice – service was generally ok if a little patchy at times – the prices for food and drink reflected the hotel status and local customs – it was very popular particularly with the French – thank you,Date of stay: October 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Ware, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PeteD60

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,Richard L wrote a review Sep 2017,40,Nice oasis,"I can't give this hotel 5 stars even though it designates itself five. A very solid 4 1/2 though. It is situated on the edge of the very noisy crowded and frenetic souks. As one walks back into the hotel the pool and gardens of this Riad are immediately in view and are most welcome.    The front desk staff were very helpful with all we asked (booking restaurants arranging tours and giving advice about prices and tipping). I'd advise availing yourself of such help since costs are remarkably fluid in Marrakech. Contrary to what I read on other reviews everyone on the desk and the restaurant manager spoke very passable English. Not as prevalent with secondary staff. A little French will take you far.    Pool was clean and refreshing with ample shady spots on the main level with a second lovely albeit less shaded rooftop pool.    Nice breakfast on the patio by the pool. We had dinner there one night and as good as most of the restaurants we tried in the Medina without the craziness of traversing the busy evening souks (or more imposing empty souk when side alley shops are shuttered. Main thoroughfare only was open and populated when we passed through post-dinner at 11:00).    Losses points on slightly tired finishings limited rooms with balconies no peephole in the door (helpful when ""someone is knocking on your door at 4:00am - ""Sorry. Wrong room"") no coffee in room and non-obsessive poolside service.

Given its central location we were able to get to all the main attractions within walking distance during our stay in Marrakesh.    However the location itself was not the only plus. Friendly staff nice and spatious rooms and the pool area as well as the inside garden did make our stay in Marrakesh an enjoyable memory.

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,James B wrote a review Sep 2017,40,Good - 4/5*,The hotel is perfectly situated in the heart of the Media - a 15 min taxi from the airport. Try to pay 140 dr for a taxi....they will push for 200+.    If you don't speak French or Arabic - you will really struggle as the staff speak basically no English. If i didn't speak French we would have had a very tiresome week of Falty Towers explanations. They need to address this urgently to justify 5* hotel rating.    Pools:  It has two good pools - they do get busy if the hotel is full. And the downstairs pool is only 30% sun at any time as in a courtyard. The roof pool was better in our opinion - more breeze and lots of sun.    PLEASE BUY A COUPLE MORE CDs - the music is on repeat all week!!    The lady who looked after the bar at the top pool was really lovely - but mostly they rest all hid in the bar rather than keeping an eye on the guests.    It would be good if the team helped with parasols proactively- you have to hunt them down and ask for help.    Food and Drink  The snack menu is fine but limited and a bit basic - sensibly priced.  The Relais is ok - not bad but not great and a bit soulless.  Breakfast is a simple normal hotel continental with fresh pancakes and omelettes - with the usual. Service is a little inattentive or chaotic - never once was a clean table ready for us to sit on. That said when you get to talk to someone they are all friendly and helpful.    Rooms  We had a mini suite with a little terrace. It was lovely. Best bathroom for a hotel in last couple of years with great shower.    AC was sadly a real let down - not cold enough and we raised it the management but nothing could be done to improve it - they did offer a new room but with a couple of nights to go it was more hassle than it was worth - our laziness!    There is free wifi but had hotel had huge problems with it this week and it didn't really reach our room. Gave us a 4G router which was perfect after we asked.    In summary - a great option due to location and pools. Better service (and language skills) AC and more variety on breakfast and menus would get it to 5*.,Date of stay: September 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E7103OUjamesb

Cost for 3 of us was 600 MAD for a day pass to the pool but well worth it. Call ahead before going since they will only have day visitors if they are not totoally full in order to keep pools at optimum for their hotel guests.    We had a misunderstanding when we arrived and paid. We were led past the pool in centre courtyard of hotel and inside. We thought we were being taken to the indoor spa pool.    We went back to reception and were able to get it all sorted..... they could not let us use court yard pool but were giving us access to roof top outdoor pool. Hotel treated us to mint tea after this misunderstanding cleared up.    This turned out to be better. Smaller pool but more private and some nice shade and good views of city.    We had lunch by the poolside which was excellent.    While day set us back 1000 MAD but pool and excellent lunch was really worth it.

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,TravelGypsy16 wrote a review Aug 2017,40,Amazing I wanted to stay,After a long transatlantic fight I was happy that I arranged for the hotel to have someone pick us up. The hotel is a short 15 minute drive from the airport which I greatly appreciated. I can’t lie when we initially pulled up to the hotel I was not impressed at all. The hotel is nestled in the middle of a city block that is lined with various shabby looking shops that are located right in the heart of Marrakesh right next to the Medina and the mosque which is a plus. I will admit that I was getting ready to be disappointed that is until you walk into the hotel lobby which I can sum up in one word BEAUTIFUL. The hotel was done up in lots of reds and very elegant. We were offered the traditional mint tea with tiny pastries as we waited to get checked in. Another nice touch was the cold scented hand towels that were given to wipe the heat and travel off NICE!!. After a wait of about 15 mins I was called to the front desk and surprised with a room upgrade HALLEJUAH!!!. We were taken up to our room which was spacious and had two twin beds with a living area that looked over the swimming pool. From our room we were able to get a panoramic view of the whole hotel and the mosque. The bathroom was beautiful and had a tub and shower separately the only problem was that our rainforest shower head didn’t work at all. Rather than complain we just used the detachable shower head    As English speakers it didn’t bother me that the staff assumed that we spoke French. We were able to communicate with them pretty easily using the little French I knew and the English that they knew so it was fine. The staff was very nice and accommodating and helped us get cabs when we needed to go somewhere. The hotel staff also helped with making sure that cab drivers didn’t take advantage of us by telling us how much the cab fare was to different places.    Food    The hotel offered buffet breakfast which offered your standard breakfast fare. It was decent    Amenities    The pool was very nice and clean and a good way to get away from the heat. Just remember to get there early every sun bed was always occupied as the saying goes “the early bird gets the worm” There is also poolside service for food and drinks which you could charge to the room.    The hotel had lots of rooms and areas in which to relax. There was a pool room computer room and various other rooms scattered throughout the property surrounding the pool area. There was also beautiful pictures of natives displayed in various times throughout the hotel which were beautiful.    Overall I really enjoyed my stay and would definitely come back as long as I have the same room (lol).,Date of stay: August 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"New York City, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelGypsy16

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,Sarah B wrote a review Jun 2017,50,Lovely day!,Staying in a Riad we fancied a relaxing day at a pool. I believe you can come for the day for 200 dirhams we did a day rate of 790 which was £63 each this included a two course lovely lunch and hour massage in the Spa which I think is great valve. The Spa area is beautiful with an underground pool too!  Lovely pool area such comfy sundbeds and nice pool on the roof too with views of the mosque. All areas are sort of a colonial feel and the hotel is not too big. The gold sinks in the bathrooms were looked after all day with fresh flowers and red rose petals in and around the sinks. The staff were very friendly and we had good service delivered to our beds and freshly cut fruit offered to all guests for free by the pool. Sometimes things are slower during Ramadan but we were not disappointed.    We did a trip to the Sofitel too but I preferred this hotel as far better service.,Date of stay: June 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Barrow, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sbuntie

To us THUS IS THE PLACE TO BE AT Marrakech:  Style of a Ryad but a bit larger.  Centrally located between Mosque Koutoubia and Place Jemaa-el-Fna - perfect.    Nicely decorated rooms - showerheads could be better taken care of as well as sinks stinked a bit even after flushing water.    Great pool (~20 m) at the patio with several sunbeds. Pool service for beverages and food? Failure - you have to search for them then they come with no motivation and no order within a week was delivered in full - always something missed.    Breakfast is served under the romantic arcades of the patio as well as inside. Offer is good as you may expect in a 5-star hotel.  Service - sorry which service? Asking 2 - 3 times to get all plates forks knifes and coffee on the table?  Chatting staff but tables are not cleaned... still chatting and we return from buffet with next plate - the old one's were still there - best we did was a stack of 4 plates. We didn't dare to complain as usually guest is kept responsible and we didn't want to hear ""you should not have gone four time to buffet"" or ""re-use the 1st plate so it doesn't stack on table"".",Date of stay: June 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Offenbach, Deutschland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SBohne

We ate at the realism de Paris restaurant once the food was good although the service not quite as good as at other areas of the hotel.

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,Wow wrote a review May 2017,40,A real Arabian Nights hotel !,"For my first visit in Marrakech I wanted to have a nice ""riad style"" hotel and after a friend's suggestion I spent a weekend in this hotel. The hotel is in a tiny little road very close to the Koutoubia (symbol of Marrakech) and it is very hidden just at the end of this typical noisy street. When you will find it ....just open the doors and then.......Magic!!!  You will find yourself in a peaceful and English-Moroccan-Indian style lobby full of charme welcomed by the personnel that will take care of you from now on. My room was on the inner side very calm and well prepared. Only problem for me is that the curtains are not dark enough and so I was waked up at 6h30 in the morning by the sun and singing birds...nice...but not if you are a sleepy bear like me...  The swimming pool on the roof is just fantastic flowers everywhere stunning view peace and sun !  Restaurant at the pool is nice but not with the same level of mistery and character of the rest of the hotel. Food is average to my taste I was expecting much better standards. Price for wines food and beverage very honest. Breakfast is room downstairs is just great food quality high you have to try the Moroccans crepes! (I had 5 of them...). The bar is also great the barman is very skilled nice mojito and again a lot of atmosphere you can play piano if you want! . In conclusion great hotel full of charme old and authentic with a real soul. I am a bit severe I hope it will be taken as a push to do better but I will give only 4 stars because of the food in the top restaurant and the curtains in the room not ok for a luxury hotel like this but I am sure I will come here again I have enjoyed every second of my weekend!

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,Debra K wrote a review Apr 2017,50,Peaceful retreat in the heart of the Medina,We stayed at the Koutoubia for 3 nights just prior to Easter and the hotel and staff were just delightful. As we pulled up to the entrance we were slightly concerned at the proximity to the busy streets which were noisy with traffic everywhere - the taxi driver could barely squeeze around to the entrance - however as soon as we stepped into the hotel all of the bustle from outside disappears and it is quiet and tranquil. We were checked in very quickly but our room was not available for another 30 minutes so we were shown to the terrace and served a lovely warm mint tea. When we went back to reception for our room allocation we were advised that our mini suite had been upgraded to a Junior and 'one of the best in the hotel' - nice! We were shown round to the room which was in a garden area of the hotel close to the patio area of the fish restaurant. The room was amazing it had an enormous bedroom and bed separate lounge area huge bathroom and a steam room and a small patio outside with table and chairs. The bed was scattered with rose leaves - and this continued on every night of our stay in various designs - such a nice touch! The room had a full size hairdryer toiletries a safe and mini bar - usual prices for drinks from there. The hotel areas are nicely looked after clean and very attractive with little nooks and rest areas everywhere. There are two pools one on the roof close to the Indian restaurant and one on the ground floor near to reception. There are a number of sunbeds in both areas with towels provided. We sampled all but one of the restaurants during our stay (we braved the fascinating chaos and atmosphere of the food stalls on our third night instead of the fish restaurant on site). The Moroccan Restaurant served traditional food such as tagines in both meat and fish versions which was great for my non meat eating husband. The snack bar for lunch time which had a variety of club sandwiches and salads available and the Indian Restaurant on another evening serving a variety of meat and fish dishes though we both enjoyed our meal here it was not overly remarkable. Service in all three locations was first class. We also had drinks one evening just outside the piano bar which had a mix of recorded music playing along with live piano sessions. Breakfast is served in the Moroccan restaurant each day until 1030 and there is plenty of choice for everyone. Hot selections fruit pastries and cakes as well as crepes and pancakes cooked freshly at a food station. The location of the hotel is great - a stones throw from the beautiful Koutoubia tower which serves as a useful compass reference point no matter where you are in the medina! You are also very close to the main square literally 5 or 6 minutes walk away and therefore all of the souks. We walked to lots of the city's museums landmarks and gardens from the hotel including the Saadian Tombs Marrakech Musuem Bahia Palace and Majorelle Gardens. There are lots of taxis around and horse drawn carriages if you choose not to keep your steps up! I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel for a stay in Marrakech. The staff here are so polite and go out of their way to help and offer great service everyone from people tending the gardens to the staff at the reception and entrance greet you with 'bonjour'/'bon soir' and it really creates a great welcoming feel.,Date of stay: April 2017,,"Battlesbridge, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/59debrak

It has the absolute perfect location in Marrakech and beforehand we were afraid of potential noice from the street and from the big mosque. We had one of the cheaper rooms facing the exterior - but there were no noise from the street at all - very calm stay! Rooms are spacious 2 toilets good bathroom with both shower and tub. Beds were large - but here is the first point for possible improvement: beds are too hard - so put a 8 cm soft top mattress on top of it and the bed would be perfect. The second point is: start moving towards a smoke free hotel by making th big majority og rooms for non-smokers. This is how things will move - so start doing it now.  The two pool areas in the garden and on the roof are both perfect.  Buffet breakfast could not be better.  This is a 5 star hotel - and it would get 5 stars from me too if they worked on my 2 points.

We stayed two nights and were kept awake both nights until after midnight with the music and singer in the piano bar. To management please either close the door to the piano bar or play music a bit quieter after 11.00pm. The prayers from the mosques in ther middle of the night also kept us awake but as this is a muslim country that is to be expected. Breakfast ( especially the olive bread) was delicious. I agree with other reviewers that the lady making the crepes in the breakfast room does look extremely unhappy but she is friendly enough when you order a crepe from her. Would highly recommend the food in the Indian restaurant Les Jardins de Bala. The food and service in the restaurant Relais de Paris was terrible. The fish we received was uncooked and had to be returned twice and the waitresses were more interested at checking their makeup in the mirrors than attending to guests. The bill then took nearly half an hour to appear due to ""technical problems"" Reception staff were friendly and efficient. Be careful of the men standing directly in front of the hotel who tell you that they work at the hotel have some free time and can show you around Marrakech. They are just after your money.

Room was upgraded and was lovely well decorated (super old black and white photo art) huge balcony large comfortable sofa fridge fresh fruit daily new rose petals on the bed and robes and slippers with both a large shower and a bathtub. Almost my favourite feature was the scent used throughout the hotel in the elevators and restrooms it was addictive. The rooftop Indian restaurant is excellent lunchtime grilled food there delicious the main bar is cosy and friendly and is perfect spot to end the night. The local rose wine served there (with pistachio nuts and olives) and on the rooftop poolside is refreshing and delicious and affordable. For a fancier night out also enjoyed the French restaurant. I loved the breakfast would agree with some others that the lady making the omelettes most days was a little grumpy but they were yummy as was the large selection of hot and cold meats fruits and cheese and the most delicious yoghurt I've ever tasted and I really really don't like yoghurt normally! Overall I found Marrakech delightful safe friendly. I only felt slightly out of place once in the main square late at night when it was a distinctly all male atmosphere but rest of the time was relaxing particularly enjoyed Sunday evening which seemed to be many local families out for a walk and dinner like the passeggiata.

Our 'Mini-Suite' overlooked a verdant courtyard garden with views from our private balcony terrace towards the Koutoubia Mosque. This became a sanctuary away from the hustle and bustle dust and heat of the Medina and Kasbah. The buffet breakfast was varied had a broad selection of European and Moroccan dishes and set us up for each day ahead. When we walked around the hotel we felt we were living in a different time and cocktails in the Piano Bar were a splendid way to end a busy but satisfying day. For two days we hired a private guide via the hotel reception. Each day we planned what we wanted to see and were not disappointed at the additional sites we were taken to. Dinner at the hotel's Moroccan restaurant was good (700MAD for 2 peoples - drinks. starter and main course) though dinner at the Indian restaurant was a disappointment - dishes lacked taste were served luke warm and were almost inedible (650MAD) . The only irritation to flag to other guests of La Koutoubia are the cost of taxi's. As with other international cities the taxi's are abundant in Marrakesh licenced metred and easy to hail However should you ask for a taxi via a hotel porter / doorman then you will find the taxi is either for private hire or the metre is switched off at which point the fare rockets from 20-40 MADs to 200 MADS. Just a minor irritation but something to be aware of. Would we return?

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,Matt wrote a review Feb 2017,40,"Wonderful location, beautiful hotel, a few inconsistencies",Hotel is fantastically centrally located with great views including the Koutoubia Mosque. Room was traditional if not a bit dated and overlooked the road outside which was noisy on occasions but benefitted from a small outside terrace. The main pool was excellent and we very much enjoyed relaxing with a beer overlooking the pool courtyard of an evening. The upstairs pool was delightfully quiet but too many chemicals in the water. The spa was also excellent. There was too much inconsistency between service / quality between different parts of the hotel. We thought the bar / indian restaurant service and food was great. Breakfast was poor the food itself was fine but tables were often left uncleared and on a number of occasions there were several tables available when we arrived but none cleared and gaining the attention of staff difficult. The concierge was really helpful with dinner reservations.,Date of stay: August 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mattcY767YB

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,Alina K wrote a review Jan 2017,30,Not a five star experience,"Stayed at Les Jardins de la Koutoubia for five nights.    We had a nice but not really warm welcome. I would have expected more information about the hotel its three restaurants the SPA and also some tourist-relevant information.  Anyway we got an upgrade and thus view to the court yard / pool.  Room is really nice clean and covers every need one might have. On top its really calm which we highly appreciated after having spent time in the bustling souks during the day.    The location of the hotel is perfect if you want to stay very close to the medina and its also just next to the famous mosque la Koutoubia.    Unfortunately we did not have a five star experience at Jardins de la Koutoubia. The common rooms and also some of the restaurants were very cold during our stay. I admit we were there during winter time but especially common rooms should be heated.    Breakfast was very disappointing. Every day the same boiled eggs white bread sweets small selection of fruits and unhappy faces from the staff. One would think that the staff would wish a good morning when entering the breakfast room - but no - thats not gonna happen. Omelettes and Crepes are freshly prepared but also at those stations staff is really unfriendly almost rude. On the food markets in Marrakesh you can find all sorts of fruits avocados etc but unfortunately they don't make their way to the breakfast at Jardins de la Koutoubia.    There is several cats living at the hotel. Even though I like cats I don't necessarily need them lying! on the chairs / sofas where I am having my breakfast. I found that really unhygienic and don't really know how guests with allergies cope with the cats in the hotel.    Due to the poor breakfast and mostly unfriendly staff I would have given the hotel 4 stars but unfortunately we had quite a bad experience during our stay. On our second last night some guests above our room played extremely loud music at 1am. After 30 minutes we called the reception. Only 1 hour later staff managed to make those guests turn off the extremely loud arabic hip hop kind of music - first they didn't want to believe us that the music came from within the hotel. The guests in the room above us turned off the music but didn't stop screaming and shouting and jumping. Then at around 6am again - loud music etc. After all we had a sleepless night and complained at the reception about that. The only answer we got was: ""Some guests are not well educated. We cannot do more than ask them to be silent"". Well to be honest - yes a hotel can never know what their guests will be doing but can make up for such a night towards other guests. No matter if a voucher for the SPA a massage or pastries - in such a case it would be the hotel's duty to make guests happy again - but no one cared about our sleepless night during our vacation.    So imagine you are allergic to cats or something unexpected happens - don't expect this hotel to take care of you or your needs.    For the ones coming for business or also the social media addicts - internet connection is quite poor and only at night you can have a proper connection.    It's a real pity that guests are not treated as such as the hotel and amenities itself are very very nice.",Date of stay: January 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Paris, France",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/203alinak
Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,Tyra R wrote a review Jan 2017,50,"Beautiful hotel, great staff",This hotel was a hidden beauty! At first when we pulled up outside the hustle and bustle area right near the Jamaa Al Fanaa we were a bit concerned but once we entered the hotel we were awed. The service straightaway was lovely they even had the hotel manager walk us around the hotel for a tour whilst they got our room ready. The decor is fabulous and it's very well maintained. Rooms are plush and extremely comfortable balcony was huge for even our standard room! Staff were over attentive even if you were walking by they would smile and greet you room service were always on point with our orders. We had lovely evening at the bar with customers singing with the gentleman playing piano. Great atmosphere the staff are an asset to this hotel. Only bad thing was the Indian restaurant at the hotel we looked forward to didn't taste very Indian at all! But that's expected considering the staff were Moroccan! It was apparently the only Indian restaurant in the area so disappointing for those of us who can't get any spicy food elsewhere! However that is a minor detail as they did other cuisines that were delicious and their buffet breakfast was very tasty. I would most definitely stay here again.

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,Louis-ji1 wrote a review Dec 2016,50,Lovely serene place in the middle of the medina,For the first time being in Marrekech the city can be quit overwhelming. Luckily we've chosen to stay in Les Jardins De La Koutoubia. When you step out of the hotel you'll get to experience a crowded colourfull impressive city. This is enjoyable when a hotel in the middle of the medina enables you to have a quit place as well. We were booked on to a garden suite(situated on one of the hotels patio-gardens) which was spacious and had its own covered garden. Even though you're just a couple of minuts away from the Koutoubia mosque the hotel with its serveral patio's is very serene. The rooms are build and decorated in Marrocan style.  If you'd like to visit Marrakech make sure you're a good negociator. In contrast to the Western part of Europe where we're from it's very common to negociate about amost everyting in Marroco.

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,Louise B wrote a review Nov 2016,50,Private elegant hotel in the middle of everything,Having never been to Marrakesh before let alone stayed right in the centre of things I read many reviews of this hotel and wondered how it would provide such an oasis of calm but we arrived and found it did! The staff were very helpful in arranging transfers for us from the airport and we were welcomed with mint tea and pastries as soon as we arrived. The patio rooms look out over the central quad which has a beautiful pool and lush vegetation. The hotel is wonderfully decorated lots of Moorish detail there are roses and rose petals everywhere! We felt so enclosed there in the best way; when we wanted to head out the hotel staff were very helpful and when we wanted to stay put there were lots of areas to sit. The rooftop pool was a real treat very private easy to come and go plenty of space. The hotel has many places to stop and enjoy the view every corner has been thought-though. The restaurants were a high standard gracious service the Indian the best. In parts the decor could do with updating but honestly this does not detract from the feel of the place.

We were only staying in Marrakech for 3 days so it was brilliant for coming and going. It's not much from the outside as you suddenly come across it on a very very busy street....but once you step inside its like a complete transformation.  So tranquil and very pleasant. Beautiful room...we had a suite which was worth getting . There was good choice of food if you wanted to eat in hotel and breakfast had a good variety also.  Very very close to main squareJemaa-el-Fnaa....so brilliant to go to and fro.  We asked reception to organise a guide for us which I would totally recommend. He took us on a walking tour to get us our bearings. It's a little daunting walking around as its so manic etc...so it was great to not have to worry as our guide basically looked after us. He was very handy if wanted to buy anything as a lot of people would get ripped off by sellers if you didn't haggle proper so he was great for advice on price etc.He saved us on spending €20 on a short taxi ride and got it for us for €4 instead!  He wasn't intrusive or anything and you didn't have to make conversation...he would just walk ahead of you and take you where u wanted. Well worth it and the guides are very reasonable.  The hotel also has a beautiful big pool but gets cool as sun goes off it...otherwise they have a smaller one on rooftop which gets the sun all day. Gets a bit crowded but it's lovely with view of the mosque.  All in all...I would definitely recommend staying here....clean stylish central nice food.

The hotel is no doubt utterly beautiful on the surface and I would expect a lot from the reviews I have read. We paid to use the hammam and pool which turned out not to include the outside pool which we were very disappointed with. The shower in the spa was broken and the plastic flip flops we had to wear made all the floors exceedingly slippery both my husband and I nearly fell on multiple occasions!! Once we found out our €40 didn't include both pools we decided to venture above ground and see what we could get for lunch and maybe how much we had to pay to use the outside pool.

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,Andrew M wrote a review Oct 2016,40,Great experience,Myself and my partner stayed at this hotel for 6 nights.    Firstly this is an excellent hotel in terms of location and amenities. I have travelled to marrakech a few times and i was surprised at how this hotel was so close to the medina and yet once inside the hotel it felt like you were in peace and tranquility. Whilst I know there are better hotels in Marrakech in terms of value for money location amenities and quality of service this is a winner.    We stayed in a city facing suite which was impressive and yet slightly dated although this is extremely common in marrakech. Veiw was not that nice however that fault is due to Marrakech as a whole rather than the hotel. Bedding was clean and rooms were ample in size. I really loved the large marble bathroom with a rainfall shower. Rooms were clean and bedding very comfortable.    Food wise breakfast is good though self sevice buffet. Large selection of fruit nuts etc and the usual omelette bar. The hotels restaurant's are good although we did not try the moroccan one as I knew quite a few other places in marrakech. We ended up eating twice at the indian/thai restaurant and once at the french. All in all food is good quality and filling however the only dish i was not inpressed with was a the chicken satay but thats was purely due to what i was used to and not the quality. Staff were very accomodating and freindly. Both restaurants are quite romantic.    The hotel has two outdoor pools and one indoor pool in the spa area. I was quite impressed with the size of the pools especially with the central location of the hotel. We spent most of out time by the terrace pool which had food and drink service (I would reccomend their club sanwich very tasty and filling) the indoor pool is in the spa area and heated. I cannot say how amazing it looks.    The fitness area is large however very few machines other than cardio. Would be better off swimming in the pool. But thats the story for nearly every hotel.    Overall staff were very friendly and accomodating. They were always there to help and never asked for tips. The hotel whilst stightly old fashioned has a great location and feel to it. I would definitely reccoment this hotel and would stay here again. I have given it four as a realistic rating as if you were to spend 3 or 4 times more you could stay in a better hotel. However that would not be sensible for most.,Date of stay: September 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/3earontour

The Indian restaurant is excellent while the Italian one is ok but had a great dessert. My wife enjoyed the spa.

The difference to back then was that we treated ourselves to a ""junior suite"".  What stands out is the roof top pool and especially the fantastic location. Just around the corner from the main square and you can basically pop in and out of the souks. It's a real little heaven when you enter the hotel from the bustling and lively streets outside. Having said that the room windows are so well isolated that you won't hear any of the noise from inside your room.  The Maroccan restaurant is good and the breakfast buffet great.  We stayed here for two nights before we left for the Atlas mountains and the dunes. On the way back to Marrakech to catch the flight home we stayed one night at the Sofitel.

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,FamilyThompson wrote a review Oct 2016,50,Superb stay at this lovely hotel,We stayed in late September 2016. We are a family with two children (8 and 10) and also travelled with our parents and other family members. Despite an earlier post the hotel is superbly well located a mere two minutes from Jama al Fna square and the souks at one end of the street with the beautiful Koutoubuia mosque at the other end. The staff were friendly and attentive bith to us and to our children. We loved the enormous mini suite as we had our double bed on the raised part of the room with steps down to the seating area which was tow very large and long sofas that became beds for the children (without cluttering up the room). The parents have a degree of privacy whilst knowing the children are snug in their beds a few steps away. The bathrooms were enormous - separate rooms for shower sinks/bath and WC all in beautiful stone. The children loved the enormous pool and we spent most of the hot afternoons around it (or the roof top pool). The Indian restaurant for lunch was delicious and the couple who run it delightful. We had an Indian banquet two days running which was a lovely way to spend a couple of hours on the roof top. Breakfast is at tables in the shaded areas around the pool with the tables interlaced between the palms/plants which was very nice. The buffet breakfast was extensive and again all members of the family found whatever they wanted. All the staff were friendly and helpful. Two members of our family and their 8 month old baby had driven from Switzerland and the hotel staff walked out to the Koutoubia mosque with us to try and find them as they had got a little lost. The baby attracted lots of warm and gentle attention and there was a high chair for mealtimes. The Caritas spa is another treat beautiful Hamman rooms enjoyed by me and my son in one and my wife and daughter in another. My wife had been to the La Mamounia Hamman the day before and whilst the decor at La Mamounia is unrivalled she preferred the Jardins Hamman as she felt the little Hamman rooms have a more authentic feel. Plus there is another enormous spa pool underground with loungers for relaxation (no kids allowed around the SPA pool which is fine as the children wanted to be in the large garden pool anyway). The hotel is clean and well looked after. It doesn't look much from the street (none of the Riads do) but it is wonderful to return to its gardens after a walk around the Souks. All in all a great stay loved by all the family and we would definitely return.,Date of stay: September 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Winchester, UK",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FamilyThompson

The staff are attentive and friendly. We decided to buy pool passes which were pretty reasonable at £15 for the day. We ended up visiting the hotel for a few days and always had a great experience. We also tried the good too which was tasty and well presented.

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,ChrisSP47 wrote a review Sep 2016,50,This hotel deserves a visit,This hotel and staff just get better with every visit. This is our third year in Marrakech and it is starting to feel like home from home. Even the simple things  such as recognition from certain members of staff a note welcoming us back from the management team and a tray of traditional cakes in our room.. Morocco is struggling at the moment due to the incidents in Tunisia France and Belgium but I as a well seasoned traveller wandered down side streets without any apprehension. Yes you will get the odd aggressive trader but the majority of people are welcoming and very happy to help.

The staff at Les Jardins De La Koutoubia made me feel at home totally comfortable and safe. I was given lots of advice on places to visit and a tour guide for hire to accompany me. My room was comfortable and clean on a daily basis with fresh flowers and petals on my bed. Breakfast lunch and dinner were always great.

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,SuproOnTheRoad wrote a review Sep 2016,40,Great property in the heart of old Marrakech,We stayed here for 3 nights in end-August and thoroughly enjoyed our time. The hotel is a 5 min walk from Jemaa el Fnaa yet provides a quiet private haven away from the bustle. The property is well maintained and the architecture harks back to Moorish times.    The great bits:  1. Rooms - We were in a Junior Suite (Room 172); it came with a living room and a bedroom... both were aesthetically pleasing (I especially liked all the prints and paintings depicting Moroccan life spread across the property). While we spent little time sitting around the living area does have a Nespresso machine which is handy.The bedroom was quite large(especially if you are used to travelling in mainland Europe) with a comfortable king size bed. The bathroom has both a bath and a rain shower cubicle and expected amenities like toiletries robes slippers et al.  2. Lovely pools (rooftop and main) - you would want to keep some time to just laze around!  3. The spa - we treated ourselves to massages/facials on 2 days. Rates are comparable to UK. The spa also has its own little pool which is great to wade around in. Note that the use of the hamman has a separate charge of MAD200. Drinks(smoothies and alcoholic beverages) can be ordered in the spa. The slight challenge we faced was with language. Most of the staff are conversant in French with very limited English.  4. Breakfast - Great spread by the poolside. Fresh juice and fruits were my highlights.  5. Service - the hotel staff were great. Always ready to help with a smile on their faces.    Could be better  1. Connectivity - wi-fi in the rooms is slow. Don't count on it for Skype or WhatsApp.  2.Piano Bar - We had a few mojitos at the Piano Bar and they need to do significantly better. (We also noticed that the choice of whisky is rather limited across restaurants in Morocco. Given the number of British tourists visiting Marrakech was a bot of surprise). 3. Les Jardins de Bala - We had starters and drinks at the rooftop Asian restaurant. While service was very courteous the food is rather sub-par. It lacked flavour and texture.  4. A few niggles in the bathroom which need fixing. Nothing significant.    To/from airport - We used the hotel pick up/drop off service for a charge of MAD200. Hassle free. Is a 15min ride to the property.,Date of stay: August 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Watford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SuproOnTheRoad

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,Sherene B wrote a review Aug 2016,50,"Great hotel, great food",We stayed here for a week. And we loved every minute. Staff are very friendly and helpfull. There are 3 restaurants you can chose from: Indian French and Moroccan. We loved both Moroccan and French the Indian not so much.    There are 2 outside pools. One on the main floor where mostly children play around and one on the roof where adults can find some peace and quiet during their holiday. You can also order some food and drinks at the poolside. Leaving the hotel is not even necessary as you have everything you need inside. During the day time it's way too hot to walk around anyway.    During our stay we had half pension so that meant each person can use up to 30 euro every night and chose whatever he or she would like to eat in all 3 restaurants. And believe me at the price of 30 euro you can have a starter main and dessert as the prices are very reasonable!    Rooms are clean and spacious room service is great and cheap compared to other hotels i've stayed at! Overall great experience would come back for sure!!    Tip: Before checking out ask for a copy of your bill and dubbel check is everything is correct as we were billed for things we didn't take out of the mini bar. And billed for drinks at a restaurant we had not eatin at.,Date of stay: August 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/277shereneb

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,Ruth Y wrote a review Jul 2016,30,Charming hotel but not a 5 star,We had a lovely welcome from reception with Moroccan tea and cakes. We stayed in a mini suit which was beautiful and immaculately clean. I couldn't fault the room which was decorated to a high standard and was very spacious. The rest of the hotel is not consistent in standard. Some areas are well maintained and inviting whilst other areas are shabby and over looked. There is free wifi although it is very temperamental. We were half board which included a free breakfast and either lunch or an evening meal in one of the hotels 3 restaurants. The international restaurant was sadly always empty. The food looked inviting but the quality was poor and the menu lacked edible choice for us E.g Cockerel goat and raw fish. We did not try the Moroccan restaurant so I am unable to comment on this. The Indian restaurant was very popular and was full every night. The food was delicious and the service impeccable. The menu was varied and accommodating to all pallets. The breakfast was a limited choice buffet of a low budget and quality. The staff were always very friendly and helpful. The pools were lovely and immaculately clean. The only complaint was that there was no waiter around the pool side to take your drinks order which meant that you had to leave the pool side and get changed in order to go inside and order drinks - this took away some of the comfort from the experience. Our room key cards failed most days which meant we had to go to reception to get them revalidated (according to reception they can not be in a pocket near metal or near a mobile phone device -practically near impossible at times). The hotel is in a very desirable location with the souks and market shops just a 5 min walk away from the hotel. The mosque is directly opposite the hotel and the hotel is generally quiet and peaceful. I have stayed in many 5 star hotels all around the world but would not rate this hotel a 5 star standard by any comparable standard. Whilst the hotel is very charming it could be improved greatly as it a 3 star standard at the very most.,Date of stay: July 2016,,"Cardiff, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ruthy2013

Prices are more than acceptable in the bar (13€ for a gin tonic and a Martini olives nuts etc. included) and in the restaurants (e.g. 25€ for a very nice bottle of red wine).  Interesting half board formula where you can have diner à la carte in one of the 3 restaurants and get a credit of 15€pp to spend on food not drinks. This allows you to have a starter and a main course at your choice. Free Illy coffee in the rooms. Pleasant breakfast buffet in the morning is included complete offer but not extended.

I came across Les Jardins de La Koutoubia by chance as i'd been messed around by Novotel Suites (see my other review). When the taxi pulled up outside I was less than impressed the exterior looked a bit tired and dated but as soon as I walked through the doors I was pleasantly surprised.    The hotel has a classic look and feel about it the gentle smell of Jasmine runs throughout. The staff were friendly and very helpful our rooms were clean comfortable and a good size.    There are two outdoor pools one on the ground floor and one on the roof top. I thought that the pool on the ground floor was the nicer of the two but found certain areas would become heavily shaded. The roof top pool looked a bit dated but the bonus was sunlight from all directions.    Location was great literally around the corner from Jemaa el Fna and a 5 minute taxi ride to the Guliez. Even with it's close proximity to the centre I found it amazing how quiet it was inside the hotel.    Breakfast was'nt great and the rooms didnt have complimentary water.

Really enjoyed our 1st stay here 2 years ago so we returned.    This time wasn't quite as good for 2 reasons. Firstly some works were going on in the rooms. Sitting round the pool during the day or outside the bar in the evening listening to someone banging with a hammer isn't as relaxing as it should be!!    Secondly and more importantly were other peoples kids. We went to relax and having kids shouting about is really annoying. One of the 2 outdoor pools should be adults only. A number of people were getting upset and we saw 2 couples complain. For the record it's not a great hotel for kids.    Breakfast and general service by the staff was pretty good.    Would I return?

Around the edge of the swimming pool is quite possibly the coolest pool table room looking out over the swimming pool.    Staff are friendly helpful and very accommodating.

I'm glad we listened it was perfect for us - a great central location between the old town of souks and the market and the new town of shops and boutiques. Also the mosque at Koutoubia is a great landmark if you're as easily lost as I am! The staff were welcoming and friendly and we were always greeted with rose petals on our bed. We had a suite with a lovely outside seating area as well as a large room and comfy (firm!) mattress.

The staff are absolutely brilliant the food superb and the rooms are sumptuous.The inner pool is nice and cold the upstairs pool exquisite. Loved the bar snacks...not too sure about the Indian restaurant (no chapatis??). Must say the in-house pianist was worth every minute. I've not heard anyone play piano with a backing track and adding his own style in many years. Laughed uncontrollably. The in-house spa is worth a visit with its underground heated pool excellent barber and easing massages. Outside a stones throw from the main square with all its hubble and bubble - the food is OK but there is much better to be found on the streets in the many café bars.

It turned out to be a lovely hotel with rooms surrounding the pool.  I read some reviews about the mosque azan being disturbing but I did not find it so. What was disturbing though was a singer that the hotel has by the pool early every evening and this was really annoying as you could not rest in peace after all the walking you have done during the day. His singing is loud and monotonous derwiche way. He got on our nerves.  Otherwise the rooms and bathrooms are spacious and clean. They bed is decorated with flower petals daily. The breakfast is decent but not OTT. The service is good.  The hotel is just at the edge of the big FNA square and walking distance to the maze of souks.

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,Kirsty MH wrote a review Mar 2016,20,So disappointing - on the food front anyway,"I must start by saying when we started planning our trip to Marrakech we did initially hope to stay at this hotel. Eventually we decided to have a bit more of an authentic experience in a Riad buried in the souks which was so interesting but we still wanted to visit this hotel as it looked beautiful and it was just as beautiful in person. The grounds rooms bars etc all look beautiful. Front desk staff very helpful.    We decided to have a meal in their restaurant. By Marrakech standards certainly not cheap so we were expecting some amazing food. Unfortunately I can not even slightly recommend the restaurant of this hotel. All bar one waiter were just plain rude. Food arrived cold or inedible (my lamb tagine had so little meat on it I left the restaurant hungry!) it was mainly grizzle and fat while my partners food was cold and quite tasteless - quite surprising from our other experience in Moroccan food. When we mentioned it no apologies or offers to heat his meal etc. Just practically ignored.    This rating is only a two for the look of the hotel - I could not recommend this hotel less for a ""treat yourself"" meal there are plenty of other lovely locations at a fraction of the price that won't leave you with such a bad taste in your mouth - literally!",Date of stay: November 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/missykmh

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,Skygirl53 wrote a review Mar 2016,40,Great location close to the Dmaa El Fna,I was in Marrakech for 7 nights and spent the first three in a traditional 5 bed Riad in the middle of the Medina (Riad Bleu De Sud reviewed separately). During my holiday I also wanted the option of staying in a more conventional hotel with a swimming pool but which was also located in the Medina and had character and charm so I booked 4 nights here. This proved to be a good decision and I really enjoyed my stay. It is located within a 2 minute walk to the main square but is very peaceful and tranquil. There are three swimming pools 1 in the courtyard in the centre of the hotel 1 on the rooftop (my favourite and a real suntrap) and a 3rd one located in the spa. The room was spacious with a separate sitting room and 2 lavatories. When I arrived in my room there were rose petals scattered in the bedroom and bathroom which I found charming. The walls are decorated with old photographs of people and places of Marrakech and were very interesting. Breakfast was served until 10.30am and was ok. There was an egg station and a pancake station with items cooked to order which were pretty good but other than that breakfast was just average. The cakes and pastries available were a little dry. Service was friendly and pleasant but nothing particularly special and I have no complaints. The exception to this was the lady working in the rooftop swimming pool restaurant. She was excellent very efficient warm and friendly. She provided the best service I received during my stay. I had a hammam scrub treatment with massage in the spa and really enjoyed this. The one issue I had following this wonderful experience was that they did not offer me a fresh dry bathrobe afterwards and I had to put on the one that was wet following the hammam scrub. I asked for a fresh dry robe which they happily provided when asked but it would be so much nicer if this was automatically provided. In my opinion this is a 4 star hotel rather than a 5 star but with a little work it could easily gain a genuine 5 star rating.,Date of stay: March 2016,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Dublin, Ireland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Skygirl53

Highly recommend this hotel. Upon arriving from the airport and taking in the first views of Marrakech city life the hustle and bustle and traffic I was found slightly daunting the prospect of a hotel located centrally and a stone's throw away Jema El Fna but as soon as you step into the hotel lobby your are in pure tranquillity and are greeted by friendly staff pouring you Moroccan mint tea and offering you sweet pastry on trays. You are lead to the courtyard pool side to complete paperwork in the sun. You are thoroughly eased into your vacation.  The hotel has 3 wonderful restaurants all serving fantastic food of different cuisines. Breakfast spread is equally impressive with a fresh omelette AND fresh crepe stand. The Spa facilites with heated jacuzzi pool is fabulous and the rooftop pool area is just as great with stunning direct views of the very nearby Koutoubia Mosque.  The ensuite rooms had a deep bath as well as a shower room within. The only small little criticism would be the fact that there is a window into the main room with a curtain and also the doors for the bathroom and separate toilet are not your normal type but more like a grated/grilled design.  This is such a minor issue relative to the broader brilliant experience I had staying here.

My tip is to ask the hotel to arrange arrange a taxi pick up from the airport as it is much cheaper (we paid 200 dirhams on our way in and only 100 when the hotel arranged the taxi!). We were ever so lucky as we got an upgrade to a suite with garden view. The breakfast is amazing and the stuff just helpful! I would happily stay here again on my next visit.  If you are thinking to explore the Atlas I suggest you to use the numerous agency dotted around the town. They will pick you up from the hotel in the morning. Make sure you get a deal (huggle if you have to) as prices will change greatly from place to place.

My fiance decided to book something 'extra special' for our last night of the week we were in Morocco. He alas chose El Koutabia.    a) this is not 5 star more like faulty towers in a beautiful building!    b) they argued with us at the beginning about how much we needed to pay by miscalculating the city tax by £50 then not apologising when we proved them wrong.    c) They upgraded us to a suite (something they threw back in our face when we complained at the end. Of course you're going to upgrade people when your massive hotel is practically empty).    d) black coarse hairs all over the room looking a bit like a weave. They did send someone to clean up after I called reception.    e) hotel restaurant is hugely over priced and not the best curry at all however sweet staff in the Indian restaurant.    f) many tired fixtures and lifts not working.    g) breakfast from 6.30am I don't think so. Expensive buffet breakfast which took them nearly an hour to set up and a lot of gossiping and paying no attention to the customers (just two of us!). After asking g for an omelette and them saying they don't do that until 7 we still didn't get it at 7.20!    We had had enough so I calmly went to reception and spoke to the only political and understanding young man who was on night duty. I explained what shame it was thatsuch a beautiful hotel felt like a hotel that was closing down and that no one cared anymore. And that all our experiences of Morrocans in tourism were one of the best. He advised me to put in writing my experience so I took the details.    The woman (I can't call her a lady) who came back on reception found it very very hard to take the complaint and proceeded in being very defensive. I thought at first it might be a lost in translation thing but her facial expressions reminded me of my middle eastern female family members when they are very angry! I knew from then that a letter to the manager would be absolutely useless as I would rather not slag off a place without speaking to management. However I am compiling a letter as I write this.    So in a nutshell do not go here as it will bitter your experience of Morocco and believe me it is no reflection of the Moroccans or the experience you can have.

Of the hotel's restaurants the Indian one (Jardin de Bala) is the tastiest. Not everything works perfectly though and something should be done about the extreme heat in the rooms.

It was my second time in Morroco but first at this hotel. After the stress of the wedding we wanted some peace and quiet and we certainly found it here. We stayed in a suite which was truly bliss. This hotel is crazy about putting rose petals on your bed everyday. Nice touch. The hotel is huge with an oriental feel to it. It's not corporate or bland you get a lot of character and friendly faces greeting you. The hotel reception is huge and comfortable to wait around in. We took day trips out and retired the hotel bar at night. The beer a Casablanca will set you back €6 and be warned the piano player is not blessed with the best voice.  Our room was really too hot at night which is the only thing that bothered me. They have some centralised heating system that comes on in every room and cannot be turned off. I opened our balcony door to find the noise of the water features kept me awake. Also birds can fly into your room if you leave the door open. I did not sleep the first few nights. The hotel manager was very accommodating and tried to assist as best as possible. I eventually adjusted and risked leaving the doors open at night. Morroco temperatures seriously drop at night. The three swimming pools particularly the heated pool on the third floor on the roof top made our stay. Oh the hotels jardins de Bala restaurant is awful Indian food.

Always inviting desk staff that are super helpful that speak fluent english french and darija (I'm sure there's other languages spoken here but these are the 3 I'm familiar with). Atay and Moroccan sweets at the desk any time of day or night. Room attendants more than friendly and genuinely attentive and caring. Hotel rooms well appointed super comfortable beds quiet rooms on the inside (cost a little more but well worth it to have the balcony overlooking pool or garden areas) bathrooms very large and roomy and always clean. Roof top restaurant (Les Jardins de Bala) by far the best restaurant I've ever eaten at. Breakfast buffet always a treat great variety of food and waiters/waitresses over the top helpful. Now to the spa....my favourite place of all. So beautiful you feel like you've been taken to another realm. Hammam experience absolutely out of this world (you have to learn to not be shy and get naked for the experience). Spa pool is quiet and inviting.

We drove here and parking though limited was not a problem and watchful security guards made sure the vehicle stayed safe.    The hotel is a lovely well maintained Merchants house with a choice of swimming pools and places to eat including a rooftop Indian restaurant with views of the Koutouba minaret.    We were upgraded to a suite which was massive with seperate seating areas two bathrooms and toilets and lots of touches that made a stay so enjoyable.    The bar was reasonable.

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,Abhishek S wrote a review Jan 2016,50,"Peaceful, luxurious with character",Take bus number 19 from the Airport bus stop is on the right exactly in front of airport. The driver or a helper asks each passenger about their hotel and suggest directions and which stop to get off.    We bought a return ticket of 50 dirham each valid for 20 days or so.    Get off at first stop walk towards left and into the first street on right. The hotel is only 5 min walk away no need for any taxi just ask driver for directions if required.    There is a fountain exactly in front of the hotel entrance.    You get a warm welcome as you enter the hotel and are greeted with a hot cup of mint tea with morrocon sweets.    The hotel's interior architecture resembles moorish palaces like Alcazar in seville.    Rooms are comfortable and the only noise you would hear would be the constant twittering of the birds . Our room was facing the pool and i would recommend everyone to opt for the same if possible.    There are plenty of roses and other flowers all around the hotel and it smells amazing one deep breath would rejuvenate your senses.    There are two swimming pools smaller one being in the terrace giving brilliant views of the koutoubia minaret.    We went to the Indian restaurant in the hotel. It is reasonably priced and has good quality but it failed to tickle our tastebuds. we only tried vegetarian dishes.    Staff was very polite and helpful.  Breakfast has a good continental selection.

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,JagXJR wrote a review Dec 2015,40,A beautiful oasis for the weary!,My wife organised this trip as a surprise. Well what a lovely surprise when we arrived. It was all she imagined and more than I could have hoped for. Not perfect but not far off. Just outside the entrance lobby you will find the busy buzzy noisy splendidly colourful and aromatic streets and squares of Marrakech but take a few steps into the hotel and you are transported into an oasis of calm and tranquility (except for the call to prayer at far too early o'clock!).    The hotel wasnt that busy as we understand that November is low season. Most visitors we spoke to seem to have been upgraded. We were rather unlucky in this respect as we had already upgraded our room at reservation stage. However the room was lovely and we had a beautiful pool view suite (after we had been given a garden view suite not what was ordered and they moved us the following morning). We couldn't really fault the room at all.    Breakfast was uninspiring but there was plenty of choice. The bacon was mostly like leather and far too overcooked (maybe this was for the American market - and we met no Americans at all!). Otherwise it was fine.    You should know that people seem to eat very late in Morrocco. We booked a table at the Indian restaurant one night for 7.00 pm and we were the only ones there for the whole meal. The food was fine but not overly authentic. I think you might be best to stick with the Morrocan restaurants off site and leave the Indian food for when you visit India London or Bradford! My wife ordered a Thai green curry and apart from the chicken in it and some small flakes of aubergine it was nothing like a green curry and should really not have been advertised as such. I strongly suggest that the chef looks at any Thai cookbook to see what a THAI green curry contains (clue: it isnt just green chilli guys!!).    There is an awesome looking spa in the basement but it is to be paid for if you want to use it not just for facials or massage but if you want just to have a steam bath or a relaxing swim. I thought that this was a bit much to expect of someone who has paid handsomely to stay in the hotel so we decided to give it a miss.    Go to this hotel and enjoy the calming nature and lovely people there. It is a joy but perhaps try out the local restaurants for truly authentic meals. If you get a chance to meet Marie co-owner of the hotel spend some time chatting to her. She is charming and loves to be of help.,Date of stay: November 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JagXJR

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,Joris Boot wrote a review Nov 2015,50,An oasis of calmness just next to Jemaa El Fna,"Location and getting about  The hotel is located in a small street that leads from the De la Koutoubia mosque to the Jemaa El Fna square; last bit is pedestrians only. The square is just a one minute walk away from the doorstep. Ideal if you want to have your dinner on the square at one of the small stands (a must do in our opinion; see our review about Jemaa El Fna). The hotel itself is an oasis of quietness with a pool and garden in the courtyard where you can choose to have your breakfast and hear the birds twitter.    The hotel  The hotel is shaped like a square (Riad) with rooms at both side of the hallway that leads through it. In the middle is a quite large garden with pool. There's a corridor surrounding it and leading you to the spa centre ""secret"" exit of the hotel nice seating areas and a pool room.  On the roof you'll find another (slightly heated) pool with a beautiful view on the mosque. Though there are plenty sometimes all the sunbeds were taken. On the other side of the roof is one of the three (I believe) restaurants of the hotel.  There's (password protected) wifi throughout the whole hotel but it is sloohoow and unstable.  We found the staff very friendly and helpful. We went to the reception a several times for inquiries and they gave us every bit of information we hoped to get. They speak both English and French.    The room  From the rooms on the inner side of the hotel you have a lovely view of the pool and garden. A truly wonderful sight every morning when you open the (double darkening very well) curtains. The rooms are very large; any other hotel would call them suites. There are a lot of cupboards a desk a ""living room"" part with a large seat a couch and a low table. Of course a safe a minibar and a tv are in the room as well.  The bathroom is very spacious too. It has a seperate bath and shower and yet a lot of room to move around. The shower itself measures about a metre by 15 I would say and has a rain head. The water temperature of the shower could vary a bit which was a little bit annoying. Naturally they provide you with enough towels and all kinds of toiletries.    Bars and restaurants  Breakfast starts at 7.30h (or was it 6.30h?) and is served untill 10.30h. Choice from the buffets is large. We liked to have our breakfast outside but there are more than enough seats inside.  The bar directly behind the reception has a very nice interior mixing grandeur with Moroccan influences. Later in the evening a man plays relaxing tunes on the piano. Prices of drinks are high. I believe 50 MAD for a beer and 60 for a glass of wine.  We did not have dinner in the hotel but the restaurants looked fine to us as did the menu and the prices.    Sight seeing  As said the square is very close by. Venture into it and the surrounding souk by yourself. No guide needed; we used Google maps after having viewed the street map using the hotels wifi. This gives you to do the square souk palace mosque and Dar Si Said museum which are all within walking distance at your own pace.  Outside the medina we did not found anything really worthwhile even the highly recommended Marjorele gardens (see our seperate review). You might want to book a tour of any kind. We did a very nice cooking class with Urban Adventures.    Weather  During our stay which was inthe middle of November we only had clear skies and day temperatures of about 25 degrees Celsius. In the evening it cools off quickly to about 15 degrees. Within the city we did not notice any winds what so ever. And obviously we had no rain what so ever.    Overall / In conclusion  In our opinion this is the place to ""come home to"" and escape from all the hustling and bustling of Marrakech. Enjoy the subtle luxury in every aspect. And when you have come at rest walk back into the city again. There is so much to experience. We stayed three nights (two and a half days) which still left us with the feeling we have to come back here again and do all the things we missed. For sure we will book our next stay in Les Jardins de la Koutoubia again.",Date of stay: November 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Willemstad, Curaçao",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JorisBoot

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,sl0wtraveller wrote a review Nov 2015,50,Calm in the Medina,An oasis of calm in the bustle of the Medina throughout the week we were there the effect of coming into the hotel with its calm spaces pool and extensive flowers did not diminish. we we lucky to be upgraded to a suite which constituted excellent value for what we had paid but as we were given free of charge the grade of rom we had booked to cover the period after checkout but before we had to leave for the airport we know that the booked room too would have been fine if not quite the treat we enjoyed.    There haas been some negative comment in these reviews about the attitude of the staff; we found them unfailingly helpful and friendly. From the one of two things that needed taking up we learnt that the issue seems to be that most of the staff have apparently good English which can lull you into thinking you are being fully understood most of the time you are but when it is about something unusual e.g. trying to explain about the low electrical hum in the room the day to day hotel English breaks down. In retrospect i wished I had used French more and as i had resolved to do. Small issue but i think it might go some way to explaining why some people found staff unhelpful; they were not  in our experience.  The biggest negative about the hotel for us was the Indian/Asian restaurant. Why should it work in Morocco? In our view it did not. The food was uninspiring the atmosphere dull and buy local standards it was not cheap. Altogether better was the Moroccan restaurant which ddi all the local staples to a good standard but we could have done without the belly dancer.  The hotel is ideally situated just of the main square only minutes from the souks and within easy walking distance of everything else in the Medina with the bonus that as it is so near to the minaret of the mosque which dominate the medina you can always locate where your hotel is.  we look forward to returning.,Date of stay: November 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Ludlow,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sl0wtraveller

The breakfast was not bad but considering the category of the hotel they could have more varieties and better service. Somebody seating near us called the waitresses three times and finally got their attention. If they can correct this I think that people will feel more welcomed and will enjoy better.

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,Chris M wrote a review Nov 2015,50,Room 24,This is a quiet elegant hotel located on a dead end street but just a 3 minute walk to the complete madness of Place Jemma el Fina the immense square teeming with people snake charmers fire eaters etc. The hotel has a gorgeous outdoor pool served by two bars many sofas and nooks a perfect place to have a drink before dinner. But what gets this hotel 5 stars is Room 24 the Koutoubia Suite. Do whatever you have to do to land it. I stayed at the hotel as part of a small tour. I asked for an upgrade of our room in advance. What I got was my own Riad on the roof a small house. It had a 600 square foot patio with a sofa chairs 2 chaise lounges and a large working fireplace. Out one door was the heated roof top swimming pool and bar that was hardly used and felt like our own private pool. Inside the room was probably 1000 square feet with a bathroom suite including a tub you could float a small yacht in. This all overlooked the minaret of the Koutoubia Mosque which is dramatically lit at night with the moon rising behind it. After taking stock with my wife we rated it one of the top 3 hotel rooms we have ever had. In case you are curious the other 2 were a suite at the Four Seasons in NYC with a 500 square foot terrace and a room at the Post Ranch in the Big Sur with a free form rock hot tub perched over a 3000 foot drop into the ocean. In short this was something very special. Now for the best part. The upgrade to this from a standard room with a tour discount cost us only $148 extra per night. In Manhattan this room would be the equivalent of a $3 million dollar apartment. I think the regular rate was around $1000 a night but if you are with any sort of tour carpe diem ask for the room and go for the upgrade.,Date of stay: November 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"West Hartford, Connecticut",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chrism2323

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,Anne H wrote a review Oct 2015,30,Disappointing given the fantastic location and the building itself.,Staying here for the second time this year and it is a lovely hotel in some ways. The location and the general ambience are indeed of a very high standard. However on this particular trip we are regretting not trying one of the other excellent hotels in Marrakech.    Be warned that the main swimming pool is not heated which means it has been pretty much empty every day. This is a real shame because around this pool is by far the nicest place to spend your time. The service around the pool is also less than attentive.    The much smaller pool on the roof is heated but has been full of children and it is not nearly such a nice space to hang out.    We have been particularly disappointed to discover that hotel guests can't use the indoor pool and spa area without paying 200 dirams per person (approx £15 per person). We were told we could spend the day for tha price but we only wanted to spend 30 minutes or so having a swim given the freezing pool upstairs. It seems a particularly ridiculous policy given that the indoor pool has been empty and it is currently raining outside!!    The hotel is quite dead in the evenings. I think this is because the main restaurant downstairs which serves Moroccan food isn't very popular. And the restaurant on the roof isn't that great either.    I am wondering if this hotel is resting on its laurels somewhat as it has had very good reviews in recent years. I am hoping that the hotel might raise its game because it has so much potential and some of the staff are very friendly and helpful.    I am yet to be convinced that I will be staying here for a third time…...,Date of stay: October 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Bath, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annehL8529EC
Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,kate19723 wrote a review Oct 2015,50,Fabulous hotel in a great location,I have just returned from a first time visit to Marrakesh with my daughter and we both loved this hotel. It is in an excellent position in the Medina just by the busy square and yet within it is an oasis of calm and luxury. We were greeted with mint tea and pastries and upgraded to a 2nd floor room overlooking the palm-fringed pool on the patio and with a view onto the famous Koutoubia Mosque. A nice touch was that the bed was freshly adorned each day with fresh rose petals. The bathroom was large with an excellent shower and we liked the separate toilet. Early evenings we enjoyed hearing the Moroccan musician play on the patio. The rooftop pool area was spacious and the food at the Asian restaurant on the same floor was superb. Friendly helpful service throughout the hotel and very good spa facilities. The only one small niggle was poor Wi-Fi but otherwise you would be hard pushed to fault anything about this hotel. We would definitely stay again!,Date of stay: October 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Uxbridge, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kate19723
Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,Jentheshep wrote a review Oct 2015,40,"Fabulous hotel, but some of the staff let it down",The hotel is in an excellent location with lovely rooms and facilities but some of the staff are less than helpful. On arrival we were upgraded to a suite and check in was efficient with really helpful people showing us to our room and explaining how everything worked. The room was very spacious with a large balcony and spotlessly clean. Room service later that evening was also very good. However the staff at breakfast were grumpy as were reception when we had a number of queries. The spa facilities are excellent as were the treatments that I had but again some of the staff weren't attentive and I was left to find my own way around. Service for food and drinks around the pool was slow and unfriendly but the girls cleaning the rooms were the very opposite nothing was too much trouble for them. On check out we asked for a taxi to the airport early the following morning but it didn't arrive and there was no apology. All in all a very mixed level of service but a very nice place to stay.,Date of stay: October 2015,,"Royal Tunbridge Wells, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jentheshep

Very good service. Liked our very comfortable large room with a very well appointed large bathroom w/window w/tub and separate shower and a separate toilet on the second floor overlooking the pool. The buffet breakfast was very good and plentiful with a couple of stations for hot plates. The hotel has a major spa. The hairdresser the manicure and pedicure were excellent.  The only negative are the corridors which need new carpeting and one of the elevators was out of order for some time.

Firstly it must be pointed out that this hotel is not 5 star possible 4 star at the best and possibly a excellent 3 star. The hotel is situated about a five minute walk to the Medina and Souk but as soon as you walk through the doors its like a sound barrier has come down it's so peaceful. Was upgraded on arrival so that was nice and although the hotel was full it didn't seem busy. A big must is to eat at the Indian and also the French the food is simply amazing.

Being in the heart of the medina you could not hear the hustle and bustle of the outside.

Two outdoor pools one on the roof with a pool bar/restaurant. In the evening this was an Asian restaurant which was superb we ate there 3 times. International restaurant had a good menu. Moroccan restaurant was good with belly dancing and music in the evening. We had lunch most days at the downstairs pool which we thoroughly enjoyed. All the staff are so helpful and friendly. It's a couple of minutes walk to the square and souks which seems to be buzzing all day and night.

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,Bibbbabe wrote a review Sep 2015,50,Stunning,Have just returned from 5 nights at this stunning hotel. We arrived relatively late evening and were dubious as we were driven through the dusty motorbike ridden mayhem of Marrakech. After being dropped outside the hotel we were met by the doorman who took our bags we sat down in the grand reception area and was served mint tea and pastries. Check in was smooth with staff friendly and polite we were upgraded to a suite much to our delight and was amazed at the decor both inside and around the hotel.  To say this hotel is a haven of tranquility is an understatement as soon as you enter the lobby area the hustle and bustle of the streets outside are immediately left behind. At times it was difficult to imagine that we were in the centre of the medina as there was little if any noise from the outside.  The hotel has two pools one on the roof top terrace and the other in the courtyard of the hotel both have sufficient sun loungers with nice towels provided by the hotel.  Housekeeping was of a high standard with our bathroom towels being changed twice daily.  We ate at the Indian restaurant on the roof terrace and the Moroccan restaurant by the pool both were reasonably priced and the food was good.  Service around the pool was efficient with drinks being delivered to the sun loungers with olives and snacks.  We would definitely return to this hotel but was.

So outside is the usual Moroccan hussle and bustle and inside it's tranquil. The hotel is built around a large courtyard with a central pool (which we didn't try as it was December !). The rooms were spacious suites and overlooked the central or a side courtyard. The breakfast was wonderful in the restaurant. We had one evening meal and while tasty it was quiet. I can only assume the guests were eating out (and there's lots of local restaurants to chose from!).  There's a spa underground which my wife says was very good. There's also a pool in what feels like catacombs - great fun. There's also an Indian restaurant on the top floor which affords great views over the city.

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,Zee wrote a review Sep 2015,50,Amazing hotel for couples and families,From the outside all you really see of this hotel is the door and a red carpet. It looks very unassuming however this is a gem in Marrakesh. Its situated just a minute or two walk from the busy market and bus stops however once you walk inside you can't hear a thing from the outside. Its just pure calm and serenity once you step through the doors. We were very luck as we got upgraded to a suite on arrival and I must say it was glorious. Overlooking the pool and patio area with generous space inside.    The location of the hotel is perfect. You're close enough to the market for it to be easily accessible however far enough away to not deal with the crowds.    All the staff were very friendly and happy to assist in any way they could. You would be wise to come here with some basic French or Arabic although some of the staff did understand enough English to get by.    Breakfast was lovely if a bit same-y after 7 days. I would like to see more of a variety of Moroccan breakfast items rather than just usual cakes and fruits.    We arranged a couple of tours with the front desk which was handled efficiently and we had a great time on them so they have good contacts in this regard.    My biggest grip albeit something not everyone will care about is the gym. It was very basic with 2 treadmills a cross trainer a cycle and a multi purpose machine. A decent selection of dumbbells would have been lovely.    Otherwise I don't have much else to say it was overall a great place to stay and one we will be returning to for sure in the near future.,Date of stay: August 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ZeeWonder

Moroccan restaurant and pool bar with NO or only 1 vegetarian option (pool bar vegetarian option only on fridays!). From 5pm to 7.30pm you can only eat if you call room service! They stop serving food by the pool at 5pm...unacceptable if you arrive by that time for a swim and can't order a drink or snack...

The staff at the hotel are very helpful and friendly the rooms clean and spacious  We loved the rose petals on the bed and in the bathrooms!  My daughters room which joined ours via a balcony was also a lovely room and each day the maids left a rose for each of them and arranged my younger daughters soft toys!  The restaurants were also of an excellent standard we especially liked the Indian restaurant on the roof ( there is also another pool on the roof) the main pool is on the ground floor.  We weren't sure when booking if this hotel would be family friendly but it certainly was providing very nice chicken goujons for our little fussy eater!

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,ramone022 wrote a review Jul 2015,50,. Fantastic hotel with great staff,On arrival we were given a room upgrade to a suite. This wasn't a room it was an apartment with panoramic views over central Marrakech. The standard of decorsize and general ambience was first class. I've stayed in 5 star hotels in the UK and this suite beats them all with ease. We even had our own patio complete with sun loungers couches and an electronic sun canopy.  In general the layout and amenities in the hotel more than merit it's 5 star rating. To be honest you need to experience it to get the full picture. Most of the photos understate the beauty of this property. For example the pool on the roof is much bigger than we anticipated and that's a general theme throughout. The pool in the central courtyard is stunning and surrounded by lots of lovely trees and little hide away's.  The hotel location couldn't be better so be sure to get out there and meet some of the local people. We've travelled fairly extensively and can honestly say the people of Morrocco are the most articulate humerous and genuinely warm people we've come across. At his point special mention needs to be made of the hotel staff. The manageress was highly visible and regularly checked that guests were happy with their experience the lady that prepared the pancakes had a beautiful smile and made my daughter Erin feel very special the waiting staff were attentive the grounds staff we polite the lady on reception had a lovely manner and the cleaning staff were a delight. It is people that can often make an experience good or bad and this hotel will stay in my memory for years to come for all the right reasons.  The food was excellent with choices to suit most tastes. The restaurants are very reasonably priced for a hotel of this stature. We have also stayed in Le Jardin de la Medina and this one edges it on a number of fronts.  I'll finish by saying I honestly can't find anything negative to say and we would like to thank all the staff for giving my family a stay to remember.

As soon as we entered we were met with Moroccan herbal tea and pastries. After sitting near the pool waiting for the rooms to be made but once the rooms were ready we went up and the hotel management went the extra length and decorated my sister's room with balloons and a poster on her door saying happy 18th birthday    The hotel has 3 restaurants all situated in different parts of the hotel the Indian cuisine is on the rooftop Moroccan is on the groundfloor next to the pool and french is in the second garden and pool. The indian restuarant has a wide range of items it is perfect for vegetarians. Unfortunately the Moroccan and french restaurants do not have vegetarian options apart from one or two dishes.    The food tastes great especially with the option of ordering whatever style of indian curry you like (e.g. Madras Tikka etc).    The hotel has 2 pools one on the rooftop next to the indian restuarant and one on the ground floor in the centre of the hotel. The hotel is in the a square shape with the middle being hollow.    Overall throughout my stay the hotel staff were always smiling and willing to help they even offered to get a henna lady in from the market to apply henna on my sister's hands as we were too tired to go find one in the market. The room service was good and they were ready to give you anything you wanted.    On our last day we took advantage of a 30% off massage voucher which we could use in their massage centre in the basement of the hotel. They had over 500 massages available for male and females with the added availability to give you a massage that may have not been on the menu.    The breakfast was amazing with over 20 selections of muffins croissants and cakes. Fresh pancake station that made pancakes to order egg station that made fresh omelettes fried eggs and scrabbled eggs with chillis cheese and other items you wished for.    Overall during the whole stay the management treated us well and were there whenever we needed them be it from calling a taxi to getting us something that was not available in the hotel i.e. balloons we wanted balloons and they went and got it for us. They even told us want sort of taxi fairs to expect so that we don't get ripped off.    We spent around £3000 including 2 night dinners 4 day breakfasts massages poolside drinks etc. thats £3000 between 4 of us which was quite reasonable.,Date of stay: July 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nikitp2014

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,piratepards wrote a review Jun 2015,50,Location location location,This hotel is an oasis - so close to the hustle and bustle of the square (2 min walk) and yet you walk through the door and its so tranquil. The hotel benefits from two fabulous pools (the largest one in the main couirtyard and a smaller one on the roof) and this is the reason I chose this hotel over a riad.    We were there a week and required the option of being able to cool off from the Marrakech heat so for this the hotel was ideal.    As we were staying a week we were also upgraded to a courtyard room.    Breakfast is great - fresh danish pastries (still warm from baking) and fresh fruit salad allow you to fill up and potentially not require lunch.    Tried the Indian restaurant - excellent but not particularly spicy.    Would throughly recommend Marrakech and this hotel.,Date of stay: April 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/piratepards

As i've been to Marrakesh before and although the Riad i stayed in was very nice the location wasn't very satisfying so i was expecting that sort of thing…a beautiful place but in the middle of the caotic maze of the Medina so me and my friend were very positivly surprised when we saw that we were just few steps away from the main square (Jeema Al Fna).  The hotel decor is opulent but not exessive with the most beautiful garden and a very relaxing swimming pool.  We really enjoyed the roof top area with the smaller swimming pool and the fantastic view of the Mosque.  We were upgraded to a bigger room very spaciousclean and with a beautiful view.  The staff has been very helpful and accommodating with special thanks to Simo the (taxi driver) that has been taken care of us.  Breakfast was served in the garden and it has been very enjoyble everithing was fresh and very tasty from the orange juice to the pastry and the delicious jams.  We alsohad lunch and nice fresh smoothies by the pool.

The hotel staff were all lovely & helpful except for Omlette lady who was good at cracking eggs but not a smile at breakfast!  Pool area is good.

The garden area and pools are beautiful but apart from the waiter by the roof terrace pool and the wonderful piano bar waiter downstairs the rest of the staff need to learn how to smile.  The breakfast is good but I wish the pancake lady wouldn't serve pancakes with her bare hands.  Riads are normally a place of calm and quiet to allow you to chill after the madness of the Marrakech streets and this was indeed the case on our previous visit but unfortunately on this occasion there was a group of middle aged English guests that played loud music and acted as if they were partying in Ibiza both by the pool and through the nights in their room. We did complain one night as we had to get up early in the morning but it didn't help. The hotel should have dealt with them properly and they didn't instead we spent half our nights awake getting more and more annoyed.

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,RutaVKriks wrote a review May 2015,50,Tranquility in the heart of Medina,Truly lovely hotel for a short stay.  Being situated in the madness of medina you would never expect to find such peace inside. The hotel is probably the largest one in the medina and certainly has the right standard to it.  To rooms are spacious with plenty of wardrobe space with a lovely bath which was decorated with rose petals everyday. Modern moroccan interior flows really nicely throughout the building and rooms. It has 3 swimming pools - the main garden one (get your beds reserved early) the roof one - perfect for all day sunbathing and one more next to International restaurant (not sure if you can sunbathe there).  The Spa. Really nice - treatments were great. I've tried 1 hour facial which made my skin feel soft and hydrated the massage my partner had was great as well. Very strangely you have to pay to use the Spa (pool and steam room) but it's complimentary if you buy a treatment.  Talking food - 3 restaurants with great setting. The international one - without a doubt my favourite. Very romantic and chilled outdoors setting food was simply great and perfect for modern european taste. Sadly cannot say the same about the asian and Moroccan restaurants even though the atmosphere was nice the food was rather disappointing.  All in all a lovely hotel that I would recommend to friends yet certain things were a let down - the air-con wasn't powerful enough for 42C!,Date of stay: May 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RutaVKriks

We had no regrets as upon arrival we were immediately offered mint tea (obviously) and upgraded to a mini suite. I'd be intrigued to know what the regular suites look like because the room we were given was spacious and luxurious.    It was a shame we still had so much to see in town because you could book a trip to this hotel not step out a ingle day and still have a great time. There are multiple dining areas three different restaurants at least two pools and various sunbathing locations with great views of the Koutoubia minaret.

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,mstraveller78 wrote a review Apr 2015,40,Lovely hotel in a great location,We stayed here for 6 nights we chose this hotel because of the location and good reviews. We ordered a car to pick us up the airport it was very expensive at 300 dirhams can only assume it was the hour. We landed at 1240am but other than the price it was a good hassle free pick up.    We booked a medina room and were upgraded to a lovely mini suite on the second floor which we were very grateful for. Massive room with a lounge area and balcony. I did specifically ask for a room away from the elavators having read reviews saying that they are quite noisy and they said that was fine so was abit bemused to find our room was next to one! but luckily not one that was used a lot so wasn't an issue. It was authentically decorated with big pictures a large tv that had some English movies channels. Fruit was replenished nice big shower with strong pressure just to note that the privacy of the shower area was only protected by a see through curtain so if you are staying with friends you might need to work out a rota!.    Two pools as has been mentioned the ground floor one doesn't really seem to be serviced in terms of fresh towels or people serving drinks. The rooftop one however the staff were far more attentive and the view is amazing. You have the usual problem of selfish people saving their sun beds with towels for hours before they plan to use them and spoiling it for others. The staff really should do more about this they have got some pool rules that prohibit this practice so they should enforce it as there aren't enough sun beds for guests. There is a restaurant by the pool that serves drinks and lovely food.    Breakfast was included I do love hotel breakfasts and there was a nice mix of everything. Lots of fresh fruit Lovely pancakes my favourite! ..The bread was very very dry so would avoid that. There was someone cooking eggs on a hot plate to order. Something I found strange was that they cooked plain omelettes on the same hot plate as ham ones Being a Muslim country there is expectation that you would haven't to worry about these sort of things but given my experiences I would just be careful what you eat if you have specific dietary requirements.    Other things I found generally the staff were friendly and attentive the location is great right in the middle of everything so there is no pressure to haggle with taxi drivers to take you anywhere unless you want to go further afield. I used the spa a couple of times and would definitely recommend a visit. Easy uncomplicated holiday in a beautiful hotel giving it 4 because it is 5 star hotel with 5 star prices so the expectations are higher!.,Date of stay: April 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Doha, Qatar",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mstraveller78

In the heart of the medina the craziness of the short transfer from the airport and then the unobtrusive hotel entrance we wondered about our choices! However stepping inside the hotel and into reception we could have been stepping back in time. Heritage and history of ancient Marrakech with subtle luxury was the feeling as we checked in. A porter in traditional dress gave us some sweet tea and then then receptionist urged us to go into one of the restaurants as it was late and she would check us in and have our bags sent straight to our rooms.  We dined in the Moroccan restaurant on the first night and with traditional live music in the background whilst enjoying excellent local cuisine we knew we had made the right choice with this fabulous hotel. There are three restaurants at the hotel and we ate in all of them with the Indian and french restaurants all so very enjoyable. Probably the best half board deal we have ever had not your usual boring repetitive buffet but with 300 dirhams credit per person we struggled even with 3 coursers to spend the money!    This hotel is authentic and a real oasis of calm and literally about a four minute walk away from the main square "" Jemaa el fna "" which is just too mad an experience to b able to accurately describe here... From souks where you you can great bargains for leather goods to 5 year olds selling biscuits snake charmers dancers musicians all with aromas of fresh cooking. A real assault on the senses This square has to be on your bucket List but is not for the faint hearted and you need to have your wits about you.    Location of this hotel is probably one of its best assets alongside its charmauthenticity quiet luxury and strange calm amidst the madness of the Medina.

Just 10 minutes in a taxi from the airport and a short walk to the main square where the night market is and the maze of souks which is great when you have just had enough and want peace and quiet.

Staff were a bit rude although you don't have to spend time with the apart from checking in etc and that's a bonus! You will enjoy this hotel for its relaxing pool and nice rooms.,Date of stay: September 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Sherbrooke, Australia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Partlyblonde

Close to everything at the centre of Marrakech.  Great experience a bit pricey but totally value for money.  I recommend this hotel for anyone who would like to relax and have a great time at this beautiful hotel.

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,aardvarktraveller wrote a review Mar 2015,30,Beware,We stayed at this property having stayed before some years ago. However if you are offered a mini suite you will NOT be in the main hotel. Clearly what has happened here is the hotel has acquired another adjacent former hotel which is accessed by a narrow alley off the main pool courtyard. Yes you will have views of the mosque (and the back of some other retail properties) the courtyard here is not up to the same standard though the rooms are nice. You can be sure about this as the previous hotel sign is over the entrance. We were disappointed as we had actually booked a room over looking the centre pool. Too late did we realise our mistake as we had already unpacked and didn't fancy moving again. The international restaurant is also in this part which is good. Breakfast is excellent and so is the Indian restuarant with lovely views. The location of this property is superb two minutes from the square and medina.

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,dieterlue wrote a review Mar 2015,50,Absolutely 5 stars!,The Les Jardins de la Koutoubia in the Medina is situated a mere 3 or 4 minutes walk from La Place and the souks - depending on how long and often you are slowed down by people wanting to sell their stuff or offer you a ride in the horse-drawn buggies. Relatively unimpressive front to the street the full charm of the hotel will begin to get you once you enter the lobby: elegantly styled it opens to one of the (three) pools ( one heated ). And all of a sudden you feel far away from the hassle of the streets.The room we were given was lavishly decorated overlooking the patio.  The service people are charming and very observant.  Of the three restaurants we visited only the Morrocan ( ok but nothing to shout about a little astounding the appearance of a belly dancer later in the evening ) and the outstanding Indian place on the 3. floor - excellent cuisine great local wines and the service a charming lot.,Date of stay: February 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Hamburg, Germany",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dieterlue

It is full of character and tranquility. Its location - literally less than a minute from Djeema El Fna - allows you to combine relaxing by the fabulous pools with shopping at the souk. The breakfast is absolutely outstanding and served in the perfect setting (you must see the photos) and for us it means no lunch as we always overindulge. The spa is our favourite anywhere that we have visited. We had a few issues with the room during our last stay in September and we couldn't have wished a better response from the staff. There are seven of us going back this Easter and we wouldn't consider staying anywhere else.

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,HermitageLondon wrote a review Feb 2015,50,Oasis of calm in Marrakesh Medina,My husband and I stayed here for a long weekend Feb 6th-9th 2015. The hotel is very conveniently situated near the Koutobia Mosque and right behind the main square of the Medina so you can pop out and walk to everything in the old quarter - we found it a perfect location.    The staff were very friendly and helpful. Our room was very quiet on the first floor overlooking the courtyard and swimming pool with a small balcony. We slept like logs every night and only once did I hear the call to prayer at 6.00 am. The breakfast was very good. I had the lovely fresh prunes figs and apricots with their yoghurt every day as they were so fresh and delicious. We only discovered the lady who makes the pancakes and flat breads on our last morning which was a shame as we would have liked to have had those each day instead of the brown bread which was disappointing and dry. The rest of the food was very good.. We didn't eat in the restaurants at all apart from our buffet restaurant as we went out each night. The bar was nice with a pianist on some nights and piped music on others. The housekeeping was excellent especially the nice touches of rose petals on your bed slippers and fresh roses on your bath robes! I would certainly recommend this hotel and would stay there again.,Date of stay: February 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HermitageLondon

No complaints about the room or the grounds which were lovely.    The front desk staff I found to be quite helpful when asked. The elevators need to be replaced and yes the furniture needs to be spruced up but you are literally right in the main square and the medina a better location you will not find.    Breakfast was large; we ate at the international restaurant and the Indian restaurant.

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,123pix wrote a review Jan 2015,50,Lovely Hotel in a perfect location,We thoroughly enjoyed our 7 day stay in this hotel which is in a perfect central location. We were warmly greeted at the reception and given mint tea and morrocan pastries whilst checking in.    The hotel is very clean and comfortable with lots of areas to sit in the shade or the sun. The decor is very traditional creating a wonderful authentic Morrocan atmosphere. Our room was lovely and spacious with a nice terrace facing the gardens and the Wifi worked really well. The roof terrace is fab with a heated outdoor pool the garden pool is also heated and great for a swim. The breakfast was plentiful and offers a good selection of hot & cold choices. All the staff in the hotel were very helpful and friendly. The bar is cosy and relaxing and serve lovely cocktails. The reception exchange sterling at a good rate and don't mind exchanging small amounts which is handy during the last days of your holiday.    We can highly recommend booking via the reception the hotel guide called Abdel Hamid Labyad. We booked 2 walking tours one for the south and the other for the north each tour was about 3 hours and cost 300 dirhams (this did not include entrance fees to palaces etc but they are only 10 dirhams each). Hamid was very friendly and knowledgeable and made each tour a very interesting experience. We went to several areas and saw many things that we would not of found on our own and having someone explain the meaning of it all made it so much more enjoyable and worthwhile.    For dining we enjoyed a lovely evening in the Dar Essalam restaurant which is situated in the souk about 10 minutes walk from the hotel. The decor is amazing good food and there are musicians and belly dancers making a really fun evening. This restaurant is also famous for its connection with a Hitchcock film. We also dined in the International restaurant at La Maison Arabe again about 10 minutes walk from the hotel towards the Hivernage area. The International restaurant is by the pool in a beautiful setting and the menu offers International and Morrocan dishes they also have a Morrocan restaurant in another part of the Riad. We first had a drink in their Jazz bar then went for dinner which was an all round excellent fine dining experience.

I booked a mini suit with 2 beds as I was traveling with my dad. When we got into our room it was a romantic couples suite with rose petals everywhere and a large bed. I said we booked a suite with 2 beds and the guy told me to just pull the beds apart. This is certainly not was I expected for 300+ Euros a night. I shouldn't have to pull the romantic couple bed apart to accommodate myself into a suite I booked. The room was big though and nice but certainly not very clean. I had to wear the slippers around in the room as the floors were dirty. The bathrooms were a bit dirty and some of the toiletries had already been used as the one by the bath tub was half empty. The staff in the restaurants and at breakfast were very friendly and nice but front desk service was pretty awful. They weren't very friendly and were a bit curt when they spoke to you. I encountered 3 different people at the front desk from the time I checked in and checked out in the 2 days I stayed there and they were all rude. They will help you get stuffed booked or done but they just aren't very nice about it. I booked this place based on location and that in itself is great. This is my second time to Marrakech and if I head back I wouldn't stay here again.

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,Tanksmon wrote a review Nov 2014,40,Great Location and a great hotel,Stay at this hotel. It has some issues but those are easily overcome by the friendliness of the staff the beautiful hotel layout and the location next to the Jmaa Fel Naa square. Our room was very clean the rain forest shower was very nice and the people were very friendly and ready to serve. They also spoke a variety of languages and my minimal French was not a problem. The breakfast layout was very substantial and they had something for everyone even halal and kosher meats. The coffee was to die for. At night they had entertainment both in the restaurant and in the open piazza next to the pool. We enjoyed the outside guy in particular -- he played a native stringed instrument and we liked his music so much we went out and bought CDs. He was very entertaining and interacted well with the small group by the fireplace. Despite these wonderful aspects the hotel has some drawbacks. The carpets are ratty and worn and the elevator door does not always open and shut properly. More important when we arrived at 10AM we had to wait almost two hours to get a room. This is OK because the lobby is nice and they provided tea (once) with cookies. But waiting that long when you have a reservation is not good. The hotel made up for it and gave our small group two adjoining rooms and a balcony that overlooked the courtyard. This made it very nice and we appreciated the hotel's effort. The only drawback to this very nice upgrade was the internet. I don't know if it was the room we were in or our technology but the internet was a constant problem throughout the trip. I am glad this was not a business trip and was very happy to be vacation. However if i remain true to my rankings with internet so important it will cost a circle if it does not work well. Something else that works agains the hotel is not having any coffee in the rooms. You have to go downstairs to get breakfast to get any coffee in the morning. For me this is a major inconvenience. You might also want to straighten out the indoor pool situation. The hotel advertises the pool but you have to pay to use it and then not for the week -- it is per visit. I thought this given the advertising was a bit misleading. Finally be careful when you leave the hotel. There are 'guides' and such that stand outside the door and will solicit you when you leave. Onc eyou get used to it it is OK but it is a little nervewracking walking out. Overall this hotel is an oasis of calm right near the chaotic environment of the main sqaure.

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,EdinburghWeesa wrote a review Nov 2014,40,Relaxing escape from the real world.,We stayed here 5-12 Nov and the remit was sun soaked relaxation with culture on our doorstep.    We were collected by friendly hotel driver from airport all seamless. 200 dirham return pp. it's a lot in comparison to local taxi's but saved us hassle.    We were booked into a mini suite which was ideal for us. A huge opulent bathroom massive bed a living area and a balcony (our view was the garden area directly above french restaurant). For the ladies: good hair dryer. The downsides though - the rooms are very hot which made it difficult to have a comfortable rest. Also the noise from rooms screeching chairs heels stomping around and the lifts was annoying. On a separate note we had a welcome bottle of water and fruit. I would think when one is paying £200 + per night a daily bottle of complimentary water is not too much to ask.    The hotel is charming and the architecture is simply lovely great pool area and we also liked the roof pool with the most breathtaking view of the Atlas Mountains.  The swimming pool however could cause a cardiac arrest!!    Lovely outside space pool table library and covered areas to take a break from the sun.    Great buffet breakfast - loved the fresh juice whilst it is continental it also offered hot food - omelettes pancakes bacon. We often took coffee and pastries back to our room to enjoy on balcony.    The restaurants are poor - on our first night tired from travelling we went to the Moroccon restaurant we had lamb and monkfish tagines bland and expensive. The Indian was also the same to be honest. The staff could do with slapping a smile on too.    The piano bar is great for a cocktail and comical/cheesy pianist though not intentionally (sorry).    All of the hotel staff Indian restaurant aside were so lovely to us friendly and welcoming. We had an issue with our bill at check out (someone signed for items using our room number and they handled it very well).    So I hope a balanced review and we do recommend this hotel - thank you so much Les Jardins our remit was accomplished.,Date of stay: November 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Edinburgh,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EdinburghWeesa
Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,drodfra wrote a review Nov 2014,40,The charm of the imperfect,"Recently stayed at this hotel with two friends for a long weekend with each of us having our own room. The hotel is in an excellent location literally on the doorstep to the Jamaa el Fna square and the Souks. The convenience of just being able to pop over to the Medina without having to deal with the hassle of taking a cab every time is hard to beat. The hotel itself has a great deal of charm and is decorated lavishly. If you look closely there's some of wear and tear but in a way it just adds to the charm a bit like an old aunt in a glamorous but slightly frayed ball gown. Nevertheless it's absolutely clean no dirt or bugs anywhere.    The rooms are all great but there are huge differences in categories. I was lucky enough to be upgraded to a mini suite and felt truly spoilt in a huge room with patio green marble bathroom and huge bed. There are some issues with noise however mostly due to the stone floors. One morning I was woken up by someone dancing tango in high heels in the room above or at least that's what it sounded like.    The staff is very sweet and helpful as well. You do get a smile from most of them and they're all quick to fulfill any requests. Special mention should go to the public relations manager who will listen to each of your concerns and will go out of her way to help.    Only let-down for me was the spa. The Hammam experience my friends and I booked was a complete yoke. From the 45 minutes the actual ""hands-on"" time was perhaps ten with just a superficial and very unmotivated scrub-down. Anyone who's ever been to a proper hammam can only shake their head especially for a price tag of 45 Euros.    In all I can definitely recommend the hotel and for me it would always depend on the available rate to decide if it's a good deal or not. It may not be a true 5 star hotel but with prices at around a quarter of La Mamounia it's a great experience.",Date of stay: November 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drodfra

We had to return the salad as it had not been washed. They did change it but then the omelette was very undercooked. We also went to the Indian restaurant to book and choose a table for dinner only to arrive later and it was taken and no record of the booking.

We were shown to our suite which was at the back of the hotel and had the most amazing view of La Koutoubia Mosque. We went for dinner in the Moroccan restaurant and had a delicious tagine - the service overall was very good - everyone was very pleasant and nothing was too much trouble. My only criticism is that there are not enough beds around the pools - the bottom pool loses the sun at around 4.30pm - whereas the one on the 3rd floor doesn't lose it till much later we managed to get beds up there on two of the days we were there the third day we had to take ones at the bottom pool and on the last say we actually reserved our own beds upstairs. If you are eating in the European restaurant at the hotel you must book - we were told that it was not necessary and when we got there the outside terrace was full but they did offer us a small table and went out of their way to accommodate us. The food was excellent. You are only a very short walk to the square where it all happens at of course the souks. We travelled with Kuoni and the offer a walking tour of the souks which cost about £15 per head for 4 hours but was worth every penny. We would stay here again as it is so central I do feel that some parts of the hotel could do with a bit of a tart up in places - the toilets by the 3rd floor pool were a little disappointing but overall it was comfortable clean and everyone was very helpful. Marrakech is all that you think it is going to be and more beware of the henna sellers in the square - my daughter got accosted by one who grabbed her hand and started drawing when we had not asked for it - she then demanded 800 dirhams and got a little nasty when we refused - she finally went away and took rather 20 dirhams offered.,Date of stay: October 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Liverpool, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KathT46
Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,Richard A wrote a review Oct 2014,50,"The Perfect Hotel For People Who ""Get It""",After booking this hotel and then reading some of the negative reports I was slightly anxious. However from the second I walked through the door at 1.30AM to my departure I have nothing but admiration for this hotel and its fantastic staff. Our room was upgraded on arrival and the room was fabulous. The pool areas are great especially the roof top with the bar and restaurant service. We ate at the Indian restaurant one evening which was also fantastic. Beautiful settings which was consistent throughout the hotel. When I read of people saying this hotel is 3 star 4 star at best and that the walls should be painted.......my advice to these people is stick to tacky hotels in Las Vegas or Dubai with no character or meaning. This is Marrakech you obviously don't get it. I'm amazed these people haven't also complained that there are no Pizza Hut Restaurants in Jemaa El Fnaa! This is an Aladdin's cave of luxury and the icing on the cake is the Spa. I challenge anybody to doubt this is not 5 star!! If you want to experience Marrakech literally half a streets length from the main hustle and bustle of El Fnaa but inside is a pure tranquil heaven....this is the place.,Date of stay: October 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Kingston-upon-Hull, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/555richarda

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,yorkwhite21 wrote a review Oct 2014,40,Top location,"To say this hotel is only seconds away from all the madness of Marrakesh it is just so quiet and peaceful a haven of tranquility. You wouldn't class it as European 5 star but overall it is pretty good. Rooms were clean and well equipped we got a double upgrade to a suite with two bathrooms and a large lounge but as it had no balcony we swapped it for a ground floor room in the new section of the hotel overlooking the French restaurant which came with outdoor seating and sun loungers too. Cant understand the recent visitor who complained the room was only made up once a day? I dont know any hotels anywhere in the world that make up rooms 2 or 3 times a day!  Bathroom was good we had bathrobes slippers and loads of toiletries all the time bed was comfy room safe and mini-bar and 40"" plasma though 90% of the programmes are in French but TV wasn't a big deal for us here.  Breakfast could be improved to say there are legions of staff always seemed to be a shortage of tables cleaned and set. French restaurant was ok without being outstanding we ate at the rooftop Indian first night as we arrived late and didnt fancy trailing out was ok but not a patch on Indian eateries we are used to.  Pool areas were spot on. There is the pool in the central courtyard and an even better one on the rooftop very well looked after by attendants who provide towels move the parasols and deliver snacks whenever you are ready. Mercifully you can get sunbeds even if you explore the city in the morning then want to sunbathe in the afternoon none of the early morning rubbish to reserve spots here!  Even though there isn't a vast choice of places outside the hotel to have a drink apart from restaurants the bar and courtyard areas were very quiet on an evening whether that was due to there not being many who liked a tipple being there during our stay or becuase the drinks were quite pricey I dont know.  I would recommend the hotel though if we visit Marrakesh again would probably try a different one.",Date of stay: October 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,boston spa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yorkwhite21
Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,RATSOMATIC wrote a review Oct 2014,40,Has the potential to be first rate but falls down in some areas,"I was torn between a 3 and 4 rating - but decided to be generous as it suited our purpose but not sure I would return.    The location and facilities are very good if you don't fancy staying in a riad in the alleyways of the medina but you do sacrifice warm hospitality personal service and attention to detail which I'm sure would receive in a good riad. We found reception staff to be acceptable - some more helpful than others. We did have a lovely mini suite with our friends in the adjoining one so we had a own private courtyard. However there were issues - a double bed and not the twin we requested (this couldn't be separated) and a bath in the bedroom and no bathroom door! (we went as a group of female friends). We were shown alternative rooms but they were not nice (paint smell and décor sparse) so we put up with the originals. One excellent thing was - it was so quiet. Maybe it was just our room but we didn't hear a thing even at 8am. Not sure many places in Marrakech are so peaceful!    We ate in the Moroccan restaurant on the first night as we arrived late - food and service not great. However we enjoyed the breakfasts - good choice fresh pastries and freshly cooked omelettes/eggs while you waited. However we couldn't understand why the pancake/crepe lady precooked them and just heated them up (while you waited) - this took just as long as cooking from fresh - she had a bowl of batter so why not cook fresh? - and they were tough and rubbery when reheated.  Some of the waiters/waitresses were positively rude - a couple of older male waiters were offhand and unhelpful at breakfast and one waitress was sullen and unhelpful when serving tea - how come a hotel which markets itself as 5* cannot find a biscuit or piece of cake to serve with afternoon tea?? We ended up (after complaining) with a plate of their ""pastries"" which are really petit fours - almonds/coconut etc bite size. There was plenty of cake at breakfast so why not have extra!    The carpets throughout (all red) look worn and tatty - there were being cleaned in the reception area but have no idea how often this is done. The ones in the corridors and in our room didn't look clean - it would be better (and more hygienic) to just have tiled floors. The uneaten ""pastries"" were left in the room for our entire stay and not replenished or taken away. Again not very hygienic!!  The gardens and pool are very attractive - our suite was lovely and some of the service was very good (the younger waiters were much more helpful and smily) - but with some improvements in the areas outlined above it could be a fabulous hotel.",Date of stay: October 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, England",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RATSOMATIC
Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,eleanor c wrote a review Oct 2014,40,Fantastic location - but sadly not 5*,"We stayed at the is hotel for 5 nights on recommendation of a family member who had stayed 2 years ago. On arrival we were greeted with refreshing mint tea. Reception staff were charming and helpful (as they were throughout our stay) . We were upgraded to junior suite at no extra charge.  Sadly the corridors leading to the room do not give great first impression - carpets are worn and threadbare. The suite was well equipped and spacious. Sadly the standard of housekeeping was not to luxury standards - drinking glasses that had been used were never replaced. Fresh fruit was not replenished and we shared the room with a very large cockroach for 24 hours. Despite putting the ""make up the room"" sign on the door the room was not freshened other than the standard once a day or the minibar ever refilled.  Breakfast buffet was adequate but was exactly the same on each day.  We ate at the Relais de Paris restaurant on the first night - the food was nothing special but adequate. The service was friendly but terribly slow and somewhat amateurish.  The facilities in the hotel are excellent - 2 wonderful swimming pools comfortable seating areas and an abundance of towels sun beds etc.  The location in the heart of the Medina and just a few minutes walk from the El Fnar square and the wonderful sights and sounds of Marrakech cannot be beaten.  Several members of staff do not speak english - this is not usually a problem as I speak passable french however for some this was still a problem. All the members of staff were pleasant and helpful but sadly they lack adequate training and experience that one would expect in a truly 5* hotel.

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,atennant wrote a review Oct 2014,50,A relaxing oasis right next to the marvellous madness that is Marrakech,"We returned last week after staying for 7 nights to celebrate my 40th birthday and I have to say I am so glad we chose this hotel as it was just perfect for us. The location is great as it's literally a 2 min stroll into the main square where you can enjoy the hassle and bustle with the reassurance your hotel is so close. The hotel manages to keep an air of serenity despite being based on a busy street we spent most days sunbathing on the lovely roof terrace complete with loungers pool and great restaurant service. It which was so peaceful you couldn't believe you were so close to the madness. The room was lovely couldn't fault the cleanliness and the staff always left rose petals and made shapes out of towels etc nice little touches breakfast was fine with good variety and staff in all areas were nothing but helpful and polite during our stay.    Some tips we found useful -    Visit the artisan ensemble complex a 5 min walk past the koutabia mosque on avenue Mohammed IV as this is a fixed price outlet so you can get an idea of prices you should be paying before you start haggling in the souks. It is actually a really nice place with a shop selling each type of traditional craft but they actually make the stuff there and you can watch them I.e. Rug making jewellery leather bags etc    Do eat in one of the pop up market stalls in the square for the experience the food is fine we ate from stall 26 with no ill effect!    Likewise the orange juice sellers are really friendly and fresh juice for about 30p is amazing    While you do see westerners walking around barely clothed I always wore maxi dresses with a pashmina and never once felt intimated and felt as though as though i gained more respect by dressing conservatively    Similarity make the effort and learn at least the word ""shokran"" thank you in Arabic it goes a long way    Finally PLEASE don't encourage the vile trade in monkey poaching from the wild and have your photo taken with the guys hauling them pitifully on chains for tourists to pose with - seeing a crate crammed full of terrified baby monkeys was the low of the holiday",Date of stay: September 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Runcorn, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/atennant

Although it is on a busy road as soon as you walk through the front doors its so quiet and calm you could almost forget your in the middle of the city. But in a great location just minutes walk away from the square which we felt perfectly safe walking out during the day or night.  On arrival the reception upgraded us to a suite which was beautiful fresh roses e.t.c however judging by the standard of the hotel i think all the rooms would be lovely.  The pools were nice - if not a bit on the cold side but very refreshing and cleaned daily. Comfortable sunbeds. The spa pool is nice however you have to pay extra for it so we did not use it.  All the restaurants are nice and romantic with roses and candles on the tables however we really liked the roof top Indian could of easily eaten everything off the menu if we stayed long enough food was excellent. Cocktail bar was also great to relax poolside in the evenings.  All the staff were helpful and friendly.  I read a few negative reviews about the hotel being outdated however we loved it just the way it was the building is 13th century and we found it traditional and authentic with beautiful Moroccan decor maybe if your looking for a ultra modern hotel don't book a traditional style riad or old hotel.

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,JMS84 wrote a review Sep 2014,30,"Poor service, needs a physical overhaul and better management","This ""five star"" hotel  quite away from being five star is located within a very old structure and is of noteworthy historical significance but is physically in poor shape with not very attractive decor. There is a sense of overall abandonment letting the structure itself and its very convenient location sell hotel rooms. Being objective the room I was given was an upgraded room which consisted of a bedroom a living area and an enclosed balcony which were quite comfortable. The bathroom was spacious  but the overall impression was a lack of luxury just heavy worn out furnishings of Moroccan style.  The breakfast was buffet style and while there were many offerings it could not be considered lavish nor high quality. The most interesting aspect of the breakfast were the three types of crepes offered however the breads and pastries were poor and flies around the outdoor sitting area were always bothersome.  The hotel's highlight is its poor service and I mean it! That is a lack of gusto to provide service. Yes when asking for something it is usually delivered but in a very reticent manner as if a favor was being performed to a person you dislike. This aspect of the hotel is what bothered me most. My feeling is that if the personnel resent providing service since it might be beneath them or a breach of their dignity then those individuals should be re-trained or replaced.  Providing service is what people seek in 5 star hotels and for which we pay dearly and just going through motions to provide service is not enough as there are other hotels which insist that personnel show the customer that they enjoy carrying out their duties.  The front desk service i.e. reception is rather surly with a very special negative vibe ""attitude"". The staff is rather poorly dressed and one or two had body oder. The staff at reception always seem to be bothered and hassled when approached. Are they fed up with tourism after so many years of catering to tourists.? If so perhaps they should consider how else to make a living just like doctors and lawyers and any other profession which might get fed up with providing services on a daily basis.  Notwithstanding everything which has been said I must say that the Indian restaurant on the third floor of the hotel was very good and provided excellent service in a romantic mystical atmosphere.  Also the gym facilities were quite good and three swimming pools within the hotel complex were also very nice although the one is the basement heated had an oder not very jasmine like.

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,SLKHook wrote a review Sep 2014,50,Struggling to find a fault,We have just returned from a 3 night stay at Les Jardins de La Koutoubia to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary. The hotel arranged for us to be met at the airport by their driver and we were then taken to the hotel at a cost of 100 dirham. Upon checking in we were given a free room upgrade we stayed in room 77 which was a stunning two storey room with two living rooms downstairs and bedroom toilet and bathroom with sunken bath and shower upstairs. We also had a patio and a balcony. After a hectic day sightseeing or in the souks there is nothing better than lying by one of the two large pools and enjoying a cold beer. The rooftop pool was our personal favourite and had a fabulous view of the Mosque. We had the breakfast every morning which was great and offered a wide selection to cater for all. One day we had a light lunch at the onsite Indian restaurant next to the rooftop pool which was also good and very tasty. This really is a perfect hotel a tranquil escape from the bustle of Marrakech - large enough to have all the facilities you need (the spa was fabulous too) but as it was originally a large Riad you still have all the beauty and traditional features of a Moroccan property. We would definitely recommend it and wouldn't hesitate to stay again if we return to Marrakech±,Date of stay: September 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Sherfield On Loddon, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SLKHook
Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,BrittanynYuvi wrote a review Sep 2014,50,Beautiful hotel,What a relief it was after driving through all the hustle and bustle surrounding the mosque and market to walk into such a beautiful hotel. Immediately upon check in we are offered traditional tea and cookies. All rooms are very large and have living rooms with large sofas. Traditional Arabic music is playing on the tv as soon as you are showed your room which again we find a display of cookies and fruits. Rose petals are scattered on the bed as well as in their spacious bathroom. Now you have to understand that this is still Morocco yes there is a slight smell everywhere the whole city smells different. Yes I think the red shag carpets in the hallway are out dated not pleasant to the eye and probably hold some of that odor however I think it's perhaps a cultural 'luxury' thing. Most ground/hallways are exposed to the outside elements so yes you will find some tiny ants here and there. Never in your bed or furniture mostly around bathroom. Nothing I feel to be alarmed of. Service is wonderful friendly and always accommodating! I do wish however that they had staff circling the pool area for guests who want to order food or drinks instead of having to get up. Food at the Moroccan restaurant and the Indian restaurant is great. Hotel is walking distance to the market. I recommend visiting the market during the day first as at night it can be a little overwhelming and intimidating. Don't shy away from food at the market I have a weak stomach and ate mixed meats at the market and it was amazing. I never got sick once I think it's due to the freshness of the meats and in America we are used to meats pumped the antibiotics and hormones. The 'new market' is a short distance away shopping mall etc. Never once felt unsafe. Don't be afraid to try new things.

The room was everything I could have asked for. Roses scattered all over the room created a wonderful romantic mood.Great size room with a seating lounge an ample sized bathroom with all toiletries that are necessary. Huge wardrobes however no iron or ironing board. Personally I always prefer one in the room but I'm sure it's available on request.    The hotel has room services and a few restaurants. The food is average slightly more expensive than I think it should be. The hotel is literally a 2 min walk away. Once you exit the hotel and turn right you will see the famous Koutoubia mosque and once you turn left you will see the market.  We found a great place next to the hotel. Turn left once you exit the hotel and follow the road round. On the right hand side is a small store that sells some great cakes and soft drinks called Laiterie Yacoute.  Also breakfast was plentiful and fresh. Plenty of choices and one of the best coffees I've had in a long time.    The hotel has a few issues it needs to address that would make this a top 20 hotel on tripadvisor.  The room service menu needs revising. It's far to bland over priced and uninspiring.  The air conditioning is not as powerful as it should be. Sitting at the restaurant near the pool at 2pm in 38 degree heat and not have an air conditioned room was unbearable.  The room booklet needs to be redone also. I realised on the last day that there was a pool table downstairs. A map and list of amenities would have been wonderful.  The hotel is slightly worn but I think it adds a certain character.  But please do not be put off by my little gripes as this is directed at management. I would not hesitate to book here again.

Overall we had a great stay at the Jardins de la Koutoubia but there is so much room for improvement it left us a little disappointed:    The pros:    - The location is great - 2 minutes walk to the main square and all the action  - We were upgraded to a suite on check-in though we'd only booked the cheapest room which was a nice surprise  - We were prepared to request a 'twin' rather than double room if asked at reception (2 guys travelling in a Muslim country) however no eyebrows raised and no questions asked and we were given a room with king size bed  - The room itself was very spacious with everything you need  - Staff at the piano bar were friendly and helpful as were the staff at the indian restaurant (the food and drinks at both were great)    The cons:    - Staff were generally unfriendly at the pool-side snack-bar and the breakfast restaurant. In particular asking for eggs was scarier than trying to negotiate a price for a snake charmer photo in the square  - We witnessed a bird drinking out of the orange juice jug (in fact it was inside the jug) and also eating fruit salad from the breakfast buffet - no staff around to do anything about it  - When I went to confirm my return transfer to the airport the staff couldn't find any record (despite my having a printed email confirming it). They happily booked another transfer though. The next day when we checked out we were ushered into a normal taxi?!  - Room needs attention to detail - shower bracket was loose and falling off drain was blocked and drained very very slowly air-conditioning was of the 'mild' variety  - Prepare for plenty of French tourists who love smoking everywhere in and around the hotel which they are allowed to do - there is no concept of a 'non-smoking' zone around the pool or anywhere.

The hotel is not perfect and the building is untidy in places and when we arrived a waterfall was running into reception from somewhere above but this was soon sorted out.The relaxing nature when you walk into the courtyard with the pool in the centre is lovely and makes for many a good photo.

We enjoyed lunch on 2 occasions but were slightly disappointed with the Moroccon restaurant for dinner as you got a more realistic experience at a better price out in the square.  Sitting outside in the evening with a beer and free bowls of nuts and olives finished the days off perfectly.,Date of stay: August 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"East Grinstead, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/steve0404
Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,-000Surf000- wrote a review Jul 2014,20,A Generally Disappointing and Uninspiring Stay.,I'd heard lots of good things about this hotel but felt that the hype didn't match the experience.    The friendliness of the check-in frequently defines the experience and the staff behind the front desk seemed unwilling or unable to welcome anyone in a genuine and friendly manner. The rooms were nice but thick and worn red carpets throughout the rooms and in the corridors gave the impression of a hotel that had seen better times. It felt as though the management were desperate to save money as our corridor was pitch black until you managed to trigger a light sensor that would illuminate the part of the corridor you were walking in. Walking out of your room and into the corridor at night was light walking down the darkest alleyways in the souk.    The staff in the piano bar were really attentive and friendly and the highlight of the stay but the piano player made a bad choice in attempting to play over an electro / synth style backing track - it was like Les Dawson versus the Pet Shop Boys. When we returned for a nightcap Les was still playing on the piano so we sat outside. The staff in the International Restaurant made us wait 10 minutes on the premise that they were preparing a table for us that in fact was already available and when were eventually seated we were asked whether we were English or French. The waiter handed us 3 menus said these are in French and left swiftly leaving us to figure it out ourselves even though badly translated English menus were available. The chef's signature dish was sliced steak drowning in his signature sauce and topped with chips. Rather like the best looking dish in a motorway cafe in the 1980's but not 5 star dining. Over breakfast (and under the fabric umbrellas covered with bird poo and general muck) one of the waiters asked whether one of the female members in our party whether she would like tea or coffee. She replied tea and he walked over to his colleagues gestured to my female friend and said tea tea very quickly which met with much laughter. I expected better than adolescent behaviour from waiting staff in a 5 star hotel.    The swimming pools are great and the hotel is in a superb location but this hotel would benefit from a manager who has the time to look at every aspect of this hotel in detail. The 3 clocks above reception are supposed to show the times in different zones but the fact that Europe is 2 hours and 10 minutes in-front of Marrakech and somewhere else is so many hours and 5 minutes behind reflect the lack of attention to detail that pervades this hotel.    I asked the hotel to arrange a taxi to the airport and the price was agreed before 100 dhs. When I arrived at the airport I gave the driver 120 dhs to include a tip. He looked at the money in my hand and said it's ok  but this big taxi you pay more 150dhs. Avoiding being ripped off in Marrakech should be an Olympic sport and I was hoping that getting a 5 star hotel to arrange the transfer would prevent this type of situation. Not so.    Undoubtedly great in its time but desperately behind the times now in so many ways. My advice - avoid and stay somewhere else instead until they've addressed some of their issues.,Date of stay: July 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Cala Ratjada, Spain",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/-000Surf000-
Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,Cchfamily wrote a review Jul 2014,50,Wonderful central oasis of calm!,We have just returned from a weekend staying at the above hotel. We flew easy jet early morning flight from gatwick and by 10 am arrived at the hotel. We took breakfast whilst waiting to check in. Nothing was too much trouble the pr lady was fantastic. She gave us a guided tour of the hotel and we were upgraded to a junior suite which was fantastic !  The rooms were clean lovely touches such as petals everywhere robes slippers etc. only downside to the room was that there was no kettle.  The pool area was beautiful lovely sun beds albeit in short supply. Hotel could defiantly do with adding more on the grass area. The poolside restaurant was nice only criticism would be could do with more snacks for the pool area as you don't always want a full meal at lunchtime.  We ate in the Asian restaurant on the first night which was disappointing. The location was great but to be honest I didn't rate the food.  We had treatments in the spa which was very nice and they have a huge indoor pool and relaxing area. I would recommend the massage.  All in all I would thoroughly recommend the hotel it's staff location and cleanliness.

It is hard to put into words the feeling that you get when you walk into this hotel and in particular the swimming pool area at night. It awakens your senses with the smells sights and peaceful silence that greets you. Even the lifts smell divine!  We were up-graded to a suite which was incredible and overlooked the main pool.

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,Syd W wrote a review Jun 2014,50,An oasis of tranquility on the doorstep of the medina,This is a great hotel in a great location.  Inside the hotel there is an aura of serenity and tranquility - but walk literally a few paces along the street outside and you are in the frenzy of the Jamaa el Fna and the Souks.  We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights in June 2014 and were fortunate enough to be upgraded to one of their mini-suites - which was wonderful. However we also looked at a couple of their standard rooms and these were also great looking rooms - all a little different and all with characater and charm. The hotel staff were mostly very friendly and very helpful.  We ate in the (Indian) restaurant on the roof of the hotel one evening and the food and service there were also excellent.  The hotel has 2 swimming pools - a large one in the centre of the quadrangle formed by the hotel buildings and a small one on the roof of the hotel. Both were well maintained and clean and neither of them were very busy.  Two small criticisms  1. Despite the numerous settings on the control panel in our room the air conditioning operated in only two modes - either full power or off! Hence the room was generally too hot or too cold.  2. The hotel reception forgot to pass on the message from our travel agent advising that our departure flight was delayed - until I approached the desk to inquire whether it was normal for our transit bus to be so late.  Notwithstanding the above this is a great hotel and I recommend it to anyone who is visiting Marrakech - although the serene and tranquil atmosphere might not work so well with boisterous children.,Date of stay: June 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Santa Fe, New Mexico",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sydw_13

The dhal was very badly made. We are Indians and know Indian cooking. Moreover we eat at Indian restaurants in New York City often and are familiar with Indian food as served in restaurants. When I complained the owner curtly said"" if you don't like the food you can leave there is the door"". I was shocked! We left and went to the reception and asked to speak to the hotel manager. The staff were resistant to calling the manager. When she came on the phone she was unhelpful and said she would speak to me the next day if I came by.  I am outraged by the conduct. The hotel has a nice ambience but the food and service will guarantee you a miserable experience.

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,RAC330CI wrote a review Jun 2014,10,Awful!,After a morning of exploring Marrakech we decided on the basis of a recommendation in DK's Eyewitness Travel Guide that the hotel welcomed non-residents to use their pool. So we took our tired & hot 4 & 7 year old children. Apart from the friendly welcome by the Concierge at the door it was quickly apparent that we were not welcome! My wife was accosted by 2 male staff waiting for her to come out of the toilet demanding the equivalent of £50 for us to use the pool! She tried to explain that we had come in good faith on the basis of the travel guides recommendation but they were very aggressive and not in the least understanding. As we left we were again admonished by the Reception staff providing us with our only negative experience of 10 days in Marrakech which was otherwise filled with warm friendly and welcoming people.,Date of stay: June 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Wilmslow, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RAC330CI

The moment we checked in we were accommodated by the super attentive staff. We had a suite with a beautiful balcony. The room was meticulously cleaned several times a day and the property and gardens were stunning! It's a stones throw from the mad chaos of the medina and most of the local attractions. Luckily the hotel arranged an english speaking local guide Abdel H'amid Labyad who was the best guide we toured with in our 10 day stay and experience with over 7 guides. We would highly recommend him to any one visiting Marrekech . Also the indian restaurant was beautiful and had amazing food we ate there 4 times and was a culinary high point for us since my husband loves indian food.

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,mariah001 wrote a review May 2014,50,fabulous roof top pool,We went to Marrakesh for a week and chose this hotel because we wanted to have a pool in the sun all day - many of the riads have pools but are often shaded in the afternoon as the sun goes lower and the walls block the sun. This hotel not only has a great pool in the central courtyard but a wonderful rooftop pool with views across the city and the Koutoubia mosque. The setting service rooms and food were excellent and the rose wine at the end of the day was both reasonably priced at about £16 per bottle and tasted good too! We did venture out to various restaurants at the hotels suggestion but found the hotel food to be the best quality. Apart from an Italian restaurant whose name I cant' recall in the modern part of the town with a wonderful pool in the middle of it - hotel I'm sure can tell you where it is and the name! We were initially disappointed with the medina and just skirted around the edges - our mistake - you need to delve in and the constant hassling to buy knock off goods stops and the exotic world of the medina opens up. We also found the casbah near the palace to be just what we expected of marrakesh and felt like we were on the set of a james bond movie - the strawberry milk shake at the cafe casbah was wonderful sitting on their roof terrace.

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,acekhan wrote a review Apr 2014,50,Believe all the good reviews - it's true,Our natural inclination was to go with a major chain but upon reading reviews I quickly got the sense that going that route would be a missed opportunity to experience a riad. If you want an authentic Moroccan experience skip the usual and go with a riad. Now most riads are small but well appointed. The Jardins de la Koutoubia is one of the bigger ones with all the luxury you would expect from a branded luxury hotel. The difference being higher level of service with a Moroccan ambiance. This particular riad couldn't be in a better location. I read a review that the morning prayer call was a problem. To be honest I never heard the morning prayer call from the nearby Koutoubia mosque. Every morning we were delighted by a full buffet breakfast. By the time we got back from breakfast our room had already been cleaned. Everyday the bed was decorated with fresh rose petals. During our 3 night stay I never saw housekeeping. This riad has truly mastered the art of being discrete as the go about servicing their guests. I really felt like a guest here. Always greeted with a warm smile by all staff. I could keep writing but do yourself a favor and book a room and experience true Moroccan hospitality. I really can't think of a single bad thing about this property.

WE LOVED IT. We felt chic we felt cared for particularly as we traveled with our 6 yr old daughter who was cared for by everyone there. Had awesome meals in the restaurant by the pool try the salmon. We also loved our breakfast in the Moroccan room. We also loved the piano bar (even our daughter had something there!). The front desk staff are the very best you can find. They helped us find a Spanish-speaking guide who took us everywhere inside the Medina (the tanneries and the silk souks are just amazing!). The room was outstanding (and they upgraded us so that our daughter could have her own bed). Perhaps the only thing we did not feel was 5 stars was the international restaurant (then again my husband is a Chef de Cusine hard to please). Otherwise I highly recommend the hotel for families.

Emailed the hotel before for transfers from the airport they were there holding a card. Charged 100dirhams each. Worth it. And took us back to the airport ?    We loved the pool rooftop the snacks were lovely and served so well.    We went quad biking for the morning once booked it via a little shop on the street  was one of the best experiences I've ever done would defo recommend it. It lasts for 3 hours.    We went to what they call the ""new town"" about 5mins away in a taxi for 50dirhams.  Basically it has newer shops and resturants. Ate at a place called mamma Mia's was lush and went to the sky bar this was so good. Had some old schoo fab songs and shisha. Defo worth a visit.    The souks are a must see the only day to really visit them is a Tuesday. Can get lots of spices.    They are some genuine good fake converse don't look any different from the real ones.    We went to le blue hammam spa was there for 3 hours proper traditional exfoliation massage pool defo worth a visit to one of them there are a few.    The mosque is over the road beautiful building even the sound of the prayer calling was so peaceful.  You very hardly get hassled not like Egypt or Turkey much more calmer and hassle free.

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,Awaywegoagain22 wrote a review Mar 2014,50,Lovely riad on the edge of the main square,I have stayed in Marrakech several times but always in large 5 star corporate type hotels. This hotel was a really pleasant change it was charming if a little tired around the edges but it did not loose any points from me for this.  Reception and concierge staff were extremely helpful and went the extra mile to please. It was a real oasis away from the madness of the surrounding area being 2 minutes from the main square.  We had a patio room this was spacious with a desk and stool plus a settee and 2 easy chairs it felt like a mini suite. Bed and bedlinen were excellent and it was a nice touch with the different arrangement of petals each evening. I also liked the fact that every morning on returning from breakfast our room had been serviced. The bathroom was enormous with bath and separate large shower however the toiletries were not very good - pity considering there was a spa in the hotel.  Breakfast provided a good selection of hot and cold dishes with freshly made omelettes/eggs and a pancake station. I did not tire of it for the 6 mornings so it was definitely of an OK standard. The waiting staff were attentive and coffees reordered efficiently.  The loungers and the pool area I a not sure would work so well if the hotel was busy as one side never got the sun. Loungers were very comfortable and the pool service was fine.  We ate lunch each day in the poolside cafe which was excellent - a good range of dishes well cooked and served by really pleasant staff.  It gave us exactly the winter sun break we were looking for and I will certainly stay here again.,Date of stay: March 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Awaywegoagain22
Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,ItinerantMedic wrote a review Mar 2014,50,An oasis in the heart of the Medina,We booked a couple of days' luxury here having spent the first part of our Marrakech holiday in a Riad. Well worth it.    It's very central just off the Jemaa El Fna central square and across from the main mosque. Taxis are easy to get outside but most of the Medina is walkable.    The central courtyard is lovely - peaceful atmospheric in the evenings with traditional music played and a wood fire in one of the luxurious lounge areas open to the courtyard. Cocktails are good (and not especially pricey by Marrakech standards). The pool on the roof terrace is small and shallow but is warm and has a lovely sun lounging area with an adjacent bar serving food attentive staff and a lovely view of the Koutoubia minaret and the mountains in the distance.    Our room (one of the standard rooms) was well furnished (if slightly in need of a refurb) with a luxurious marble bathroom and courtyard view. Rose petals on the bed and in the bathroom were a nice touch. Complimentary toiletries not great however.    Excellent buffet breakfast in the courtyard downstairs with everything I could think of (including lovely fresh fruit freshly cooked crepes and eggs) and good strong coffee. There are three restaurants on site. We tried the Indian upstairs (absolutely excellent) and the French place (good). Food at the poolside also very nice indeed.    Didn't use the spa which is in the basement level but looks suitably luxurious. The fitness centre is small with four cardio machines one weights machine and some dumbbells but wasn't busy.    Top tip: bring earplugs. The pre-dawn call to prayer is unavoidable anywhere in the Medina and the Koutoubia Muezzin is one of the more well amplified but less melodic!,Date of stay: March 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ItinerantMedic
Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,Donttravellightly wrote a review Mar 2014,40,Great Hotel in the Middle of Marrakech,This hotel is simply beautiful. It has a gorgeous garden pool as well as a heated rooftop pool. The breakfast was very nice to include a DIY egg boiler and omelet station.    Our suite was a little odd. It was rooms 112/114. However they are forever a suite because 112 has a nice tub and great rain shower in that bathroom and 114 has a bathtub and the only toilet for the suite in there. It was kind of odd having to go into our kids' room to use the bathroom.    The hotel is hidden away on a crowded side street just 150 yards from the Koutoubia Mosque and seemingly around the corner from the main square. It is very convenient to walk just about anywhere in the old town.    We drove down and while I'm not sure where other people park security had us leave our car parked right there outside the front door for two days.    I did use the spa which has it's own pool as well. I would rate the spa as average on technique and value but above average on decor.    Right now they are doing some renovation in the hotel. They start the loud noises at 10 am and stop at 5 pm.,Date of stay: March 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Stuttgart, Germany",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Donttravellightly
Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,chilledmum wrote a review Mar 2014,50,Luxury in the wonderful chaos that is Marrakech,We stayed here around 8 years ago and I'm glad to report things haven't changed. It's an oasis in the middle of bustling Marrakech in a side street just a stones throw away from the main square it is built in Maroc style there's a pool on the ground floor and a heated pool on the roof which is a sun trap from here you can see the koutoubia minaret. The breakfast is great our room was upgraded upon check in. Great maid service.  The only slight moan is that the service on the rooftop bar was a little slow but this didn't really bother us.  There is also a great Indian restaurant on the top floor.  We stayed for a weekend and hired a minibus for a trip to Asni and Emily - atlas mountain villages.  The minibus was £100 all in for 7 of us(10-3pm) we had a tagine lunch up in the mountains and was back in Marrakech by 3pm. I would thoroughly recommend doing this our children loved it.  The hotel isn't very child friendly there are better hotels out in the palmeraie to cater for younger families this hotel would be better for couples or for those wanting luxury close to the city centre.,Date of stay: February 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,Brighton,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chilledmum
Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,rosiealfie wrote a review Mar 2014,50,Peaceful haven in the heart of it all,If location is everything this hotel has so much more. Situated in the very heart of the medina it is steps from the Koutoubia and steps from the main square and the souks. Whilst the frenzy of Marrakech starts on the hotel doorstep inside all is the exquisite calm of unruffled luxury yet with the unique atmosphere of a riad. For a week in January we stayed in what they euphemistically call a 'junior suite' but is really so much more. From our balcony the size of another lounge and sumptuously furnished accordingly (even a retracting roof)we had a good view of the koutoubia.    The hotel is quite lovely cool walkways and quiet corners with seating abound and it is furnished and decorated in a traditional Moroccan style. The staff bring warmth and are genuinely welcoming and helpful.    We also enjoyed the room service and especially the hotel's Asian restaurant. This is a very well run quality and traditional hotel in a great location.

It was just marvelous to be able to come back at lunch time and jump in the pool or if we simply needed a break of all the noise and people.  La place is just one footstep away and it is very simple to find its way back to the hotel.  Downside were the looks of the boys at the indian restaurants when we were in bikini at the pool next to it and that all the taxis waiting in front of the hotel were triple the price the other ones at the place asked for.  The concierge downstairs in the lobby were amazing and the rooms were clean. A couple of cracks in the wall but besides that everything was gorgeous. The roses in the room were a nice touch.    I'm more used to hostels so this was very luxurious and lovely nice to have stayed there!  Best thing ever: BREAKFAST! sadly it was so hot I could never eat as much as I wanted to!!

We received excellent service from the concierge - who helped book a perfect trip to the beginning of the Atlas Mountains.    The room we got was a very big room with both a bathtub and a shower in very good condition. The breakfast was very good - with everything you could want and need.

Its ideal for touring the city right near the main square. I think no hotel in its class is as close. We had a huge room a suite really with a terrace in the Paris Relais part of the hotel (relatively new). The room was nicely furnished although everything was a little worn in a way that wasn't problematic but isn't what you'd expect in a ""true"" 5-star. Lots of light in the room and bird song from the garden outside. The facilities were magnificent in their day and worth experiencing despite being a little tired. The service was quirky but charming at the front desk. Room maid service was excellent. Room and bathroom scrupulously clean. Bathroom huge but use your own shampoo and bring conditioner (there's none).Rose petals in a different pattern on the bed every night. Our room was quite far from the main entrance so it proved a little easier to use the street that was ""privatized"" into the hotel when they bought up surrounding buildings over the years. Other comments: wifi weak breakfast (the only meal we ate there) adequate no better than that the front desk booked superb drivers for us at fair prices (!); front desk is charming but a little unreliable on wake-up calls messages etc.",Date of stay: February 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,NYC,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/philmNYC

We were thoroughly spoilt with rose petals arranged on our bed every day and a fresh rose it was definitely the most luxurious hotel room I have stayed in. Not only was there a bedroom and lounge there was also a dressing room and our own outside seating area. There are 3 pools but we used the lovely heated pool and sun terrace on the roof it had a beautiful view of the Atlas mountains for us to enjoy while we relaxed on our very comfortable sunbeds which an attendant had placed a towel on for us. I read reviews before we left that tipping was a problem at this hotel NOT true no one expected a tip and we gave tips at the end of our stay to the people we felt most deserved it. All the staff were very friendly and helpful I highly recommend this lovely opulent hotel. It is also perfectly situated with only a five minute walk to the main square which is very lively both day and night.

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,sickofripoffs wrote a review Feb 2014,50,Very comfortable,Les Jardins De La Koutoubia is a fantastic location if you want to base yourself right in the thick of it. The interior of the hotel is comfortable warm and a pleasant sanctuary away from the busy streets outside. The hotel does indeed have that 'worn' feel but in a plesant way you can tell the hotel in well maintained and it feels like a more authentic Moroccan experience. The large riad style makes you feel like you are in a Moroccan palace and I loved the roses and rose petals which are dotted around the place it's a lovely touch. There is gorgeous warm red and orange furniture/fittings and many places to sit and have a coffee and soak up the sun. Our mini-suite was great the room was big clean and very comfortable. The only negative was our terrace did not catch the sun at all so you may need to be specific about your room's position if this is a problem. We ate in the Moroccan and Indian restaurants both served beautiful food although you will pay more for your meal compared to many restaurants outside. The rooftop pool was great and was very relaxing. We had a half day hammam the staff were great gave us plenty of time to relax in between treatments and it felt like we had the place to ourselves. All in all this hotel is a pleasure however you do pay a premium for the central location.,Date of stay: February 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,Manchester,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sickofripoffs
Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,E M wrote a review Feb 2014,20,Nice place with quite some irritating aspects,The hotel is in an excellent location to explore the old city by walking. The facilities are very nicely decorated and create a nice atmosphere. That smoking is allowed in all public areas of the hotel like in the bar and all the restaurants is not to our taste.  Our room - a junior suite - was clean and cosy and well serviced. The very closely located minaret however provides a hard early morning wake up call.  The food was nothing to write home about. Mostly tasteless and not well presented.  We had booked half ward which turned out to be a big mistake. The daily rate (30 €/person)was not compensated when we did not go for dinner. Lunch was also not taken into account either neither were drinks. Eventually we paid much more by taking half ward instead of paying for what we ordered. This came as a bit of a surprise to us and the hotel administration showed an irritating lack of customer orientation here.

Extremely short stroll to the medina (passing a superb bakery just a few steps away). Rooftop heated pool was a hit with the kids...not to mention the joy at finding rose petals on the beds. Clean elegant nice piano bar and several food options at the hotel. Breakfast was a generous feast.    They only would allow one child in each room. For us no problem as we enjoy having a seven year old share our space. But something to keep in mind if you are 2 adults traveling with 2 young ones.    There was a spa but we did not use it.    We were also upgraded to rooms that shared a patio....so the kids were able to stroll back and forth between the rooms. For us...a really nice bonus.    Rugs in the hall were a bit tattered.

The bed and bathroom were covered in fresh rose petals which were replaced every day when the room was serviced. The bathroom itself was large and comfortable and although showed some wear and tear it was in keeping with the atmosphere of the Rhiad (some minor knocks and bumps in stone is only to be expected).  The staff were polite and attentive without being ""in your face"" - a pleasant retreat after the attentions of street marketers of Marrakech.  Eating wise the breakfast was lovely (and very entertaining thanks to a beautiful and playful kitten who enjoys saying hello to everyone in the morning - ladies watch out for any flappy bits on your handbags!).

It was actually quiet in the evening which was great. The room was spacious with fresh roses provided each day on the bed complete with rose petals. A very nice touch. The evening of my first day there a small set of tagines provided fresh chocolates. Bottles of water were available in the room. An in-room safe is provided.

It is not available in the rooms and speed and stability varied from time to time in the busy lobby area where the best (?) access seemed to be available. Need to improve this considerably.

Booked previously online at a discounted price which included breakfast.    Checked in which seemed to have taken such a long time however the front desk kindly upgraded our room which was nice we did see the previous room ‘medina view’ and would have been gutted staying there for the price we paid the mini suite we got upgraded too was gorgeous and very nice.    Location is the best location to be so close in the market but so quiet and lovely inside. The pools looked lovely such a shame they charge to use the indoor pool its pathetic after the price you pay to stay they charge so much to use an indoor pool!    Wifi was shockingly poor had better staying at a 2 star! Kept disconnecting after every minute I called reception and they apologised thats all they could do. I guess it is a common issue.    Hotel looks worn out and in need for refurbishment carpets tiles dust and generally.    The bathrooms have a see through glass so if going with a friend/family member be warned.    Breakfast had a very big selection of food but service was very poor they do not speak much English and not sure why they have to serve water and juice so you have to wait for a long time when you want a glass of water. But the selection was very good and tasty and filling.    Only reason not voted 1 star because we got upgraded and because of the location.

All said and done it is a bit hefty on the price even with breakfast included.

The service was a great plus to this place and people could not do enough for us. There were multiple restaurants and a roof top pool.    We would certainly have no hesitation in staying here again.,Date of stay: November 2013,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Youngklaus

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,BobandTina wrote a review Nov 2013,30,Lovely but overpriced,We stayed here one night as the grand finale to a biking trip. Our room and the surroundings were lovely. However it was overpriced and the front desk staff tended to be sullen. It was the first time in our 10 days in Morocco we had seen that type of attitude. My husband was quite ill while we were there so I went in search of some bottled water for him. No one showed the least concern but did manage to charge a very steep amount for the water. All that said the buffet breakfast is lavish and delicious. We had originally planned to stay n extra 2 days but the price pet night was over US$350 per night. Marrakesh offers many other options for lovely accommodation without this price or attitude.,Date of stay: October 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Vancouver, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BobandTina
Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,PTh wrote a review Nov 2013,30,Overrated and too expensive for what you get,The hotel has a really excellent location in the heart of the medina. But that's unfortunately about all there is that is positive. During our stay we found a lot of negative points: the elevator didn't work for 3 days (and the management didn't even care to post an out of order message) our room was not cleaned well (we spare you the details) the breakfast is not as good as you await from this kind of hotel and half of the time the tables we not cleaned properly and the napkins for meals were untidy.

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,hikers_11 wrote a review Oct 2013,40,"Fantastic stay, lovely staff",We had a wonderful stay at this hotel. We stayed here from 1st-5th September to celebrate our sons 21st birthday as a family party of 5 adults. When we arrived we were upgraded to a suite at no extra cost even though we had only paid for a triple room. The suite was really lovely. The following day we asked to move to a larger suite as we were sharing with our son this was not a problem. We were shown a number of suites and chose a 2 room one with balcony. (All the rooms we were shown were different which makes this hotel so different) We were prepared to pay the extra cost but the hotel manager said as it was our sons birthday it would be a gift from the hotel to us. The rooms were kept lovely and clean and toiletries replenished every day. The air conditioning in the room was fantastic especially when it's 35*c outside.    The pool area is lovely no problem getting a bed as the pool man puts clean towels out each time the bed is vacated. We only ever used the main pool on the ground floor but there are two other pools.    The breakfast was served around the pool each morning there was plenty to choose from wonderful fruit selection omelettes and pancakes cooked to order.    Most lunchtimes we ate in the hotel pool bar which served great salads and fish also great burgers. We found the prices very reasonable and really nice food.    We stayed in the hotel for two evening meals one in the French restaurant and one in the Moroccan restaurant. The meals were ok not fantastic.    The piano bar is great for cocktails and drinks in the evening you can sit outside in the lovely gardens or in the cool air conditioned bar. All the drinks are served with a selection of olives and nuts.  The hotel arranged for a guide (Hamid) to take us around the souks he was so knowledgeable and well worth paying for.    While the hotel is a little tired in places it adds to the charm it's quite shabby chic and individual which we loved. It is also a 2 minute walk to the Medina and the Souks. The staff were very attentive and nothing was too much trouble. A special thank you to Abdul who looked after our party so well nothing was too much trouble.    We would recommend staying here to our friends and will go back and stay again we loved it.,Date of stay: September 2013,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Ipswich, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hikers_11

The room was big but a tad worn (plastic toilet seats shower would not drain old carpets).  The major negative is the aircon. The hotel simply does not seem to have a proper ventilation system. We complained 3 times even the hostess who comes around at breakfast but nothing was done and nobody enquired if it had been sorted so they are very aware of the problem. I would not recommend this hotel in the Summer time because it gets very hot in Marrakech.  The pools were good. The ground floor one is not heated but the rooftop one is. Breakfast was nice too and we could get free internet in most places including near the pools. Great location. Service was ok.,Date of stay: September 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NatCLondon
Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,whitfies wrote a review Oct 2013,30,A little bit disappointing,We are just back from a 4 night stay at JdlK. We were in the cheapest room but for some reason we ended up with a suite which was really pretty big - bedroom separate sitting room and two bathrooms each with bath and shower. This was way bigger than we expected and we peeked at other rooms being cleaned and these were a lot smaller so I guess we were just lucky. There was zero noise from other rooms the a/c was great it felt reasonably clean and we were pretty happy on the whole.    The servicing of the room let things down a bit - despite two bathrooms we only had one set of towels and on one day the maid took these and did not replace them so we had to call for more. Our mini bar was not replenished once during our stay either.    I think other people complained about the service and while it isn't American or Asian levels of service we found everyone to be helpful - at the font desk changing money or asking for restaurant recommendations or at the restaurant by the rooftop pool where they were pleased to fetch drinks and food.    Breakfast had a good selection and choice including bacon which we thought they might not have. Oddly they had a toaster which took forever to basically turn bread into biscuits and coffee which was sludge and watered down orange juice. All unforgivable at a supposed 5* hotel I would say. It's so easy to get these basics right. We know they can do fresh OJ - we had it by the pool later on for 25dh (although it is for sale at 4dh in the main square!). We found poolside food and drinks to be a little more expensive than they should have been and one day we ate the obligatory club sandwich which was very poor.    On the final day we booked massages at the spa and expected to be able to use the full facilities while there. The only facilities we were allowed to use were the cold pool and were told we could not use the hammam. Quite why anyone would use a cold basement pool when there is a hot rooftop one is beyond me. No one was in the hammam and it was all on and we were paying £100 for two massages yet not allowed in. I feel this is poor. The massages were good though and they had nice changing facilities.    The hotel is excellently located just a few mins walk from the chaos of the main square yet immune to the noise.    So room was better than expected service was fine food and drink somewhat of a let down the spa was mean ... not good at what is supposed to be a 5* hotel. If this is 5* then I guess La Mamounia must be a 10*. We did have a comfortable stay though and the rooftop pool is nice. If they styled themselves as a 4* hotel my rating would be higher.,Date of stay: October 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/whitfies

We booked a standard room and were amazed at the size and the fact we had 2 bathrooms! turned out we had been given 2 rooms 103 and 104 which would be great if you are planning a family trip. The rooms are a little tired as is the whole feel of the hotel but there was nothing terrible..... oh apart from the man singing in the bar at night... I am not sure if it was a joke??? he was so bad it was amusing! They were a bit mean with the pillows and towels but we survived! The pools are fine with comfy loungers we found the rooftop pool the nicest place to sit and the staff up there were very friendly and and worked very hard looking after everyone. Breakfast was good enough however it's slightly irritating that they gave you cheap watery orange juice when you know you can get amazing fresh juice in the square for 4 Dirhams! The tea and coffee were bad too. We had lunch of times by the pools and it was adequate the Asian option being the better by the room top. We had treatments in the spa on our last day and the facial and massage were good. We were allowed to use the pool in the price of our treatment but not the Hamman which seemed a bit mean given the cost of the treatments.... the pool inside by the way is cold and not worth paying for additionally.

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,Mark wrote a review Oct 2013,50,"Lovely traditional peaceful oasis in the heart of the city, great rooms, facilities and staff","I don't get some of the reviews and ratings here. We have just completed our stay at the hotel and we've had a lovely peaceful time and the hotel and staff have all been great. We had a great holiday and the hotel was the perfect base. We were well treated and looked after perfectly.    It is probably one of the largest and best equipped hotels this close to the centre of the city. So it is perfect being only 5 mins walk from Jemaa el Fna the souks and nowhere in the medina is more than about 30 mins walk. If you want a large modern spa hotel then you'll probably be better off further out or if you want a small cosy riad then go for that - but if you want a hotel with all the 5* facilities AND be close to the centre then this hotel is perfect.    The staff were all friendly and tried their best to help with every request. They didn't always provide the quickest service but that was all part of relaxed atmosphere. The concierge was helpful and we booked two trips and a cookery class and all our transfers through the hotel - all of which worked out well.    The hotel is based around two large courtyards. The first courtyard contains the main pool and is surrounded at ground level by a lovely garden the entrance lobby the bar one of the restaurants the cafe and a whole series of quiet cosy alcoves and rooms. At night it is delightful to sit out with a drink to take in the glinting lights the gentle local music and the wonderful birdsong.    The other courtyard has a garden overlooked by the patio rooms and suite balconies and contains one of the three restaurants.    There are three pools the main courtyard pool the rooftop sun terrace pool and another in the spa. Three restaurants all of which were great although I think the Asian ""Jardins de la Bala"" was the best.    We had one mix-up. I'd emailed in advance to the hotel to arrange a transfer from the airport however the Moroccan government decided to change daylight saving time at the last minute so there was a misunderstanding about our arrival time. But it was resolved quickly.    As far as rooms are concerned we were upgraded to a mini-suite so we had a super large bed then down some steps there was a large seating area - we had a balcony overlooking the garden courtyard and the bathroom was lovely traditional 'old Moroccan style'. The bed linen and bathroom were clean and well kept and were very comfortable. The rooms had a lot of light and storage space which is often not the case.    The one gripe was a shortage of accessible plug sockets.    One thing highlight though was that on arrival the rooms was beautifully decorated with roses (actually there were roses all over the hotel) water some nice fruits and a selection of Moroccan pastries.

Thankfully very little has changed and i still rate this hotel as one of the finest in Marrakesh for location service levels qulaity and standard of rooms and general all round appeal.    There have been a lot of neagative reviews on TA regarding this hotel and to be fair everyone is entiltled to their own opinion however i feel that some of the reviews are far from justifield.    The staff are extemely helpful and accomodating having emailed the hotel prior to our visit they were kind enough to arrange a taxi for us which was waiting at the airport as we arrived. Check in was simple and efficent and an upgrade to poolside suite was most appreciated. The hotel is also spotlessly clean.    The room itself was stunning very large comfortable bed big lounge 2 bathrooms and 2 sets of patio doors which opened up to the view of the pool. attention to deatil is wonderful from the fresh fruit in the room well stocked mini bar selection of complimentary toiletries right dowm to the rose petals laid out on the bed after the room has been cleaned    We used the roof top pool where we found the poolside bar staff to more than helpful there is an excellent choice for lunch and the food it lovely very weel cooked and presented and not partucualrly expensive for a hotel of such quality. Sunbeds are plentiful and very comfy and the sunterrace is just a lovely quiet sun trap    Breakfast is great plenty of choice and again well cooked and dinning on the terrace by the pool is just a great way to start the day. There are also the hotel restraunts which have been revieed seperatly    In all if you want a very relaxing quality hotel just a short stroll from the medina but set in its own completly tranquil setting this hotel is peerfect and highly recomended,Date of stay: October 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,bolton,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OLILIDS

We arrived to stay our last day in Marrakech in the hotel to be greeted by a very unprofessional staff but specifically one in particular who is working in reception. The woman working at the reception desk was completely unprofessional in handling both our check in and check out. She was very rude indeed and had a very disrespectful attitude and tone. At check in her unfriendly mannerism took us by surprise and we thought she might be having a bad day. However during checkout when asked did we take something from the mini bar under the assumption that the water was complimentary we said no as we were leaving she ask the porter to call us back into the hotel and across the hall yelled out that we did not pay and that we have lied. When I confronted her and asked her to speak in a politer manner she continued her unprofessional yelling and hand gestures that I have never seen a receptionist in a 5 star hotel behave! My partner had to also ask her to lower her voice and speak to the clients with some respect. I was about to tell her that we are not trying to save 20 dirhams on a water bottle when we have paid around 3000 dirhams for a room but refrained from making this obvious comment.    It is unfortunate to have to experience this at a luxurious place like Les Jardin de Kotoubia we were very much looking forward to spending our last night in a nice place which in our case was really dampened by this woman at reception.,Date of stay: October 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bubu0
Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,Ahajtrip wrote a review Sep 2013,30,Great location but not five star,Great location by the main square and souks but as others have said far from five star. In need of major upgrade of some rooms and most corridors. To be fair work was happening on the top floor- sadly loudly during our stay! Our children were given an updated room which was lovely with a good bathroom. Our next door room was old and pretty disappointing with the bathroom floor flooding every shower due to ill fitting shower head and curtain that was too small air con that rattled loudly unless on full power which made the room too cold. Service and food very variable but that true of everywhere we went in Morocco- we live in Asia where service is generally considerably better. Certainly expected a little more leeway on checkout time. We asked for an extra two hours for one of our two rooms but this was denied. Wish our room had been cleaned so promptly during our stay! We were surprised that the third indoor pool was not free. One MAJOR problem for us was the poor wifi. The computers in the computer room were wifi reliant and we could not find anywhere in the hotel where the wifi was reliable. Unfortunately though on holiday wifi was necessary for us on a couple of days and there was none available for many long stretches during our stay. It would not take much to really improve thus hotel and the staff. We visited a smaller riad for dinner which showed what could be done and where the rooms just looked more cared for and where service was excellent with management very visibly monitoring service levels.,Date of stay: September 2013,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Hong Kong, China",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ahajtrip
Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,Lindsay B wrote a review Sep 2013,40,Overall a super hotel with great facilities,First impression is not good - the hotel entrance is on a rather horrible narrow road full of vehicles motorbikes donkey and cart (yes really!). However as soon as you enter the hotel it opens out into a lovely setting around a stylish pool. Despite organising our pick-up from airport the hotel said that since it was after 4pm we had to pay the driver ourselves in local currency - which you can't get in the UK. Hotel therefore paid driver and asked us to to re-imburse them in euros. What a faff! Why could they not simply charge our room account? Anyway without asking our mini-suite was upgraded to a lovely junior suite. Large marble bathroom separate bedroom with sitting room opening onto large balcony. Room needed a bit of maintenance eg poor sealant round bath sink not draining etc. Le Relais and Jardins de Bala restaurants are great. Fillet steak costs around £14 and nice local wine at £11 a bottle! Moroccan restaurant was not too great and we were not the only diners to be less than impressed. Hotel reception could not give me change of a 100 note (ie about £8) and we had to wait for a porter to nip round to a shop. Shows that they still have a bit to go to be a 5 star European standard hotel. The Spa is very good and a full one hour massage was about £50. Heated rooftop swimming pool is lovely and was never that busy. Staff at the hotel were all friendly and helpful. You are very close to the mosque and if you are a light sleeper get ready for calls to prayer at various times of day and night. 5 minute walk to the main square if you can be bothered - you will either love it or hate it.

The staff are so kind polite and really go out of their way to ensure you have a first class stay. The Riad is beautifully decorated with quiet rooms to sit and read a book or take in the birds singing in the foliage. The centre focal point being the swimming pools and dining area. We tried all of the restaurants and they were equally fantastic the food was cooked to perfection and served in the same manner. We were unfortunate to be there while building work was on which was slightly off putting hearing that each morning but it didn't spoil the holiday and everything else made up for it. The location of the hotel is perfect if you wish to explore and we took one of the hotel provided trips to Essouria which was a fantastic cultural but tiring day out. I booked a luxury suite and it was total luxury with a beautiful and spacious bedroom balcony over the courtyard seperate living room and very large bathroom every morning rose petals were placed in the the bathroom and on the bed their attention to detail is noticable in all they do.

It really was a warm welcome and we were ushered to our room very quickly due to the lateness of the hour. At breakfast all the old faces came to say hello and the pancake lady had a long chat with our 11 year old daughter. The rooms are excellent with service to match. At lunch the chef even made us a pasta dish as suggested by wife. This is much more then I can say for the ""Indian"" restaurant on the roof of the hotel. The first time I we had a miserable experience. I thought I would give the chef a chance to improve and tried to explain to him how we would like the food cooked - he was not interested and even questioned why I would want to eat there. This was a huge favour as we were recommended the original Riyadh Restaurant (Maison Arabe) by the receptionist. The Hotel is well suited for families and the kids were having a fantastic time in the pool. It is even better suited for walking everywhere due to its very central location. Ideal for the square and souk as this can only be visited in short bursts. In between one can enjoy some fantastic cocktails in the bar - I would recommend the Mojito. There have been reviews questioning the 5 start status.

We booked a standard room but was upgraded to a mini suite. The hotel facilities were excellent and the staff were extremely polite pleasant and helpful.    The hotel itself it excellent had a really old worldly feel about it (hence the faded colonial glory) and you could imagine what it was like in days past.    There were 3 pools but the main one was my favourite. It had a wonderful relaxing feeling and staff ensured that if the beds weren't being used then they were cleared for others. The pool on the roof was an absolute sun trap (perfect for topping up your tan.)    Not only was the hotel beautiful but it was also extremely close to the Souks and the Medina.    Whilst there were a few minor issues (mainly around our room looking a little tired) I would definitely stay at this hotel again.,Date of stay: August 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Leeds, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DannyK183

Arrived at the hotel 16th August @ 12.30am.  Fast Check in by Abdul (hotel Manager).  Room was beautiful clean contemporary spacious.  We booked a standard room but was upgraded to a mini suite.  Buffet breakfast served with a poolside view waiters wonderful polite and cannot fault the professionalism.  Roof terrace pool & further 3rd pool available if other pool is busy.

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,CliveCFC wrote a review Aug 2013,40,Very Relaxing,This was our second stay at this hotel and it was just as good as the first time. The hotel is very well placed for the Medina only a few hundred yards to the souk. We went for the sun (lots of) and a relaxing time the hotel did not disappoint. Some of the areas could do with abit of updating  i.e around the roof top pool the decking is getting abit tried and some of the fittings in the room could of been better. It was abit hit or miss with pool side service one day good the next not too  clever ....different staff. Norman in the piona bar was very good and also as we went during Ramandam he explained the holy festival to us which made the experience very moving. We would not go again during Ramandam as it limited the times you could go the souk.    Overal we will be going back in few years as we find the hotel and city a very interesting place to visit. Yes you can get abit of hassle but it's nothing to worry about if you go as a couple or more.,Date of stay: July 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"East Grinstead, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CliveCFC

It has a lovely feel to it as its very ""colonial"" and one really feels as you are staying in a traditional Morroccan hotel. They say there are 3 pools but you can only use two properly. The other is a plunge pool by one of the restaurants and you cant sit around it. The hotel is literally a 5 min walk to the main sq and souks you couldnt really be any closer. The food is good and its worth asking to be upgraded as we got a free upgrade to a junior suite. The air conditioning was very good and the breakfast was superb.    There is a however and apart from a few individuals the staff were appalling. We were not made to feel welcome either by the reception staff of the waiting staff. If any of the management read this review they really need to upskill their staff in customer service especially as they advertise this as a 5 star hotel. Our check out left a sour taste in our mouths as well. We had paid our bill and then came rushing out to tell us that they hadnt charged us for our mini bar after I had paid our bill. They were neither apologetic nor friendly about this which really annoyed me. We asked for an air conditioned cab which didnt arrive until 25 mins mins after the time that we wanted and left us running late for our plane again they were neither apologetic or didnt really seemed that bothered.    In short a really nice feeling hotel very authentic close to everything but appalling customer service.

It is the perfect location on your way to or from the main square of Marrakesh/the souks or other sights. We loved the entry into this oasis of calm when just a hundred or so meters away there were thousands of people out and about. We would stop for pre or post-dinner drinks or a lunch or just to calm down before returning to our riad a bit further away. Always enjoyed the somewhat colonial atmosphere if that that description is allowed beautiful setting with the pool and lights good service nice snacks served with drinks and cool decor.

We booked a junior suite and were very pleased when we saw our room. A 2 room suite with plenty of space for the kids. Everything nice and clean and with ""authentic"" Moroccan decoration. The room overlooked the garden restaurant and had a wonderful balcony.    The hotel is a demonstration in french decadence in both service and guest. It's great to see a few french guests sitting at the breakfast terrace restaurant smoking Gauloises in the pleasant mornings.    For the kids the roof terrace pool was great. It is heated to compensate for the cool nights and big enough to play in for hours. Some guests are not too happy with loud noises from kids but were able to make nearly everybody happy with the balance between noise and happy laughter.    The pool in the courtyard is not heated and a good place to go to if you want to avoid noisy kids - although when the days are hot the pool is ok for a swim at the end of the day.    It only takes 5-7 minutes to walk to the Djemaa el Fna which makes this hotel perfect with kids since they can quickly come to see the wonderful crazy life at the square quickly see a little of the Souk and then return in good shape to the hotel.    The garden restaurant is perfect for a quick dinner. The food is ok and the garden is beautiful in the evening. Can also be recommended for guests not living at the hotel - the same of course goes for the famous cocktail bar which is a decadent pearl of cocktail bars in Africa.",Date of stay: May 2013,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Copenhagen, Denmark",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BluestarAirlines

Entering we were immediately in an oasis of peace and tranquility. We had a mini suite which was very clean and quiet. Breakfast is fine even for someone not liking eggs! Oranges are every where in Marrakech but the orange juice at breakfast was guarded like the crown jewels - and your glass of juice was poured at your table rather than being self-service! A basic I thought was missing was complimentary water in our room - plenty in the mini bar to purchase but we found it much cheaper and plentiful outside the hotel. Evening meals - menus offered a very limited choice!! Position of the hotel was perfect and minutes from the main square - handy to drop off your shopping.

We have no complaints everything was super and attentative there was always a lounger available at the pool the lifts were free and available (one of our party uses a mobility scooter) the food was great breakfast fresh and pleantiful etc. The only place the hotel falls down is in the slightly dated decor and the carpets in the halls with were rather thin. Also a room service tray near our room was left on the floor for almost 12 hours. Having said that given that we visited in June with temperatures of 40+ this is the only hotel with lifts and two beautiful pools which were needed come the early afternoon so close to the medina and I would gladly stay again. A huge thank you to all the staff who were so very accommodating to our scooter user. Also the hotel is happy to recommend autorised tour guides - we had a lovely chap who charged 20 euro for 3-4 hours and knowledgeable and thorough and defrfinately worth hiring.

He recommended water park oassiria but when I explained we wanted something smaller and more comfortable a hotel with pool and grounds etc he simply changed the name of the water park to a hotel name and sent us on our way (at a 50% taxi premium).  So we didn't stay here or visit here and this may sound like sour grapes....but if you are thinking of using the spa or pool book ahead - I'm sure it is lovely - but don't get scammed or fobbed off with a water park which is more expensive unless you want flames and wave pool etc (see my separate review) and you can also get a free minibus.

The hotel has a traditional older feel and is very comfortable. What was really impressive was how quiet the hotel was particularly as the hussel and bussel of the streets was just1 minute walk away. The central swimming pool area was incredible during the day - the pool is great the sunbeds all new and modern with cooling misting machines which cool you down with a light spray of mist every minute - they really had thought of everything!    The service around the pool was also fantastic - as soon as your glass was empty a member of staff was there to ask if you needed anything else.    There is also a number of places to dine on the top of the hotel which looks out over the city - great champagne bar too !    We were eager to see the hidden bits of the city and reception arranged us our own personal tour guide who showed us around which worked out at about £30 for two hours! The guide spoke fluent english and was great when at the market as he really had our backs.    Being a health and fitness fanatic I was very impressed with the gym and spa facilities. The gym lacked free weights but the cardio equipment were good.

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,pinkpashmina wrote a review May 2013,40,Peace & vintage luxury,A great experience in Marrakech previously stayed in Riads but decided to try a hotel and we were not disappointed. It's not much to look at from the outside but when you go in its like taking a step back in time in a good way! It's a mix of classic morroccon and western decor.... Service was quick efficient & friendly and once our rooms ready..... We were not disappointed we had been upgraded to garden view rooms and had a beautiful view of the courtyard pool. We were on 2nd floor. Our room was beautiful with rose petals spread across the bedding and in the bathroom. Had a separate living room area with a partition. Only negative about the room was the bathroom in the 1st day they were having problems with the water and it appeared to be a red/brown substance which had us worried! But this was soon rectified and no other problem the rest of the time. Spent the first few days at the rooftop pool which got quite busy from about 11am onwards there is waiter service there but if it's just water you would like better of going to a shop beside the hotel and buying a few bottles to keep with you in the hotel. We did order food at the rooftop pool and the Thai chicken salad was delicious! Highly recommend it!! We ate in the Moroccan restaurant in the hotel 1 evening and the food was lovely with traditional Moroccan music and belly dancing. Must try a cocktail in the Piano bar also although the pianist would be better off not singing.... The mojitos were divine! But my favourite part of the hotel was breakfast! So much choice! From fresh fruit cooked breakfast pancakes omelettes breads and pastries there was something to suit everyone's taste!! Overall my friends and I had a great experience we found the staff to be friendly and helpful plus it's a great location to the medina! And the main square. Would we go back?

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,LondonMonty wrote a review May 2013,20,This is not a 5* hotel,There were so many faults with this hotel that I don't know where to begin. We had arranged for the hotel to collect us at the airport. The car didn't show. The rooms were claustrophobic and of really bad quality. There was a red rug on the floor and I had the feeling that it had never been cleaned. The bathrooms were sub-standard an awkward shower over the bath which flooded everywhere and the water would turn hot/cold in a second. The free products were tacky and it was obvious that they were 'filled' daily! The towels were rough and cheap. I had to phone twice for a bathrobe which was missing and Reception insinuated that I was blind. TV is boring only 4 English speaking channels and 2 of these are news only. There is one lift in the hotel which is always full of staff and maintenance people. The main pool is nice but has brown stains on the bottom. The service around the pools are almost non-existent. On day two I couldn't find a sunbed and was told to come back the next day! The menu for lunch is basic the food always served 'warm' and not hot. Moroccan restaurant very nice but I had to ask for my wine glass to be changed twice as it was filthy. The staff are ok some a little surly. The one redeeming feature is the Clarins spa - now that is 5*. This hotel has so much potential as it is a beautiful building with a good location but there are way too many faults and it should be graded as a 3-star.,Date of stay: May 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,london,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LondonMonty

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,Jill0400 wrote a review May 2013,20,Location isn't everything...,Our travel agent said this hotel was a 5 star but in our standards it was more of a 2 or 3 and we rarely stay in hotels that are 5 star. This hotel is located in the old town near the medina and markets (souks). So it was close enough to not need taxis or other transportation. If that is what someone is interested in then it's a perfect location. But to enter the hotel one has to go down a small narrow lane crowded with people donkeys and carts cars scooters and trash. The outside is dirty and unimpressive. The inside was quiet and welcoming and felt very safe.    The hotel staff was nice at the front desk and in the restaurants. The breakfast was plentiful with a good variety of food. The room was tired worn and far from clean. It had two bathrooms with one toilet....strange layout. They provided robes and slippers which I appreciated as I would not have gone barefoot. The pictures in the brochure made the hotel look plush but it was far from it. It was a gross misrepresentation. Even the pool looked worn. The tiles on the floor were brown (see pic). However the pool attendants were very accommodating and it was nice to get out of the mayhem on the streets outside the hotel.    We didn't complain to the hotel as that's not our style but as we depend on recommendations we felt it necessary to let other readers know. I don't really know if the cost represented the standard or not.

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,Tripmonster wrote a review Apr 2013,10,Catalogue of errors by this hotel ruined our stay in Marrakech. DO NOT STAY HERE!,"Chose this hotel based on other trip advisor reviews as I normally do. We are lucky enough to have stayed in Marrakech several times for business and pleasure. Our first choice hotel ""Dar Ayniwen"" was fully booked and we had to travel at short notice so needed another good 5 star hotel with pool spa facilities etc. On paper this hotel looked great - sadly that's where it ended!  Our customer picked us up from the airport and drove us to the hotel he was not impressed with the service we got on arrival at reception and had words with them. I turned a blind eye to this as was tired and looking forward to getting comfortable in the room and freshening up. We were pleasantly surprised with a room upgrade to a suite. Good start I thought. Walked through lovely gardens to our room. Can't fault the setting and layout of the hotel. The room was large and seemed fine at first glance so we tipped the porter and started to freshen up and change ready to meet up again with our customer and guests for dinner. Had a meal in the Brasserie restaurant and the food was good. They did however serve our Moroccan customer with the wrong dessert which he was understandably unhappy about and it wasn't remedied. We had cocktails in the piano bar afterwards then said our goodbyes to retire to bed. This is where the real catastrophes began!  Our room was really hot so my OH put the air conditioning on. Didn't seem to make any difference and there was no air to breathe. We didnt call reception as it was the early hrs of the morning so resorted to 'sleeping' outside in the patio area on the plastic seating out there. On top of that when we went to get a cold drink from the fridge we found that it wasn't working and the drinks were warm. Obviously hardly any sleep was had at all and not a good start to our 4 day stay.  My OH reported the faults to reception in the morning and was told that he must have turned the heating on in the room as no air conditioning was available in the hotel til next month??!!!! a) the switch was turned to the icicle symbol as on all a/c units so how could this be the heating? b) why was a/c not available in a 5 star hotel at any time of the year and especially when outside temperatures were so high??!!! c) why weren't we advised that there was no a/c available and fans provided in the rooms??!!! d) how dare they blame my OH for the temperature of the room!! I would never have booked a hotel without air conditioning.  They told us that the fridge would be fixed whilst we were out that day. We were shown a standard room to look at but it was tiny and we were told nothing else was available as they were fully booked so decided to see whether it would be ok to remain in the room without 'heating' and with a working fridge! We went to check out the rooftop pool. As we were so exhausted from no rest the previous night we fell fast asleep sitting next to the pool and got badly sunburnt. We travel extensively and have never burnt before so yet another disaster to add to the list - due to complete exhaustion from the room situation.  Went out for dinner with our client again that evening but had to leave early missing the evening show at the restaurant due to tiredness and my OH feeling unwell from his sunburn. We returned to a boiling hot room fridge still not working and now the toilet wouldn't stop running after being flushed! Another extremely uncomfortable night on the patio with no sleep. The room although large was also very tatty electrical wires sticking out no handles on the bath to get in/out very cheap toiletries bland black & white badly photocopied prints on the walls poor mattress etc. What a farce. No way that this is of 5 star standard. I think in fact they had most probably been overbooked and shoved us into a room that isn't usually used rather than being 'upgraded'!!  As you can imagine we were fuming by now. 2 nights stayed but not a single night being able to sleep in the bed in the room!  After more complaints and trips to reception my OH was told that another larger room had magically appeared and we could move into that. Of course that meant that whilst he was out on business I was left to pack all our clothes up wait for a porter and unpack it all in the new room. (Whilst this was happening yet another workman was trying to fix the fridge and remove it from the room!). So that was a day completely wasted for me - no trips to the souks or relaxing to be done. Great! We were meant to be dining together in a restaurant we had booked before leaving the uk but had to cancel that as were both far too exhausted. My OH booked me in to have a massage to cheer me up and try to soothe my exhaustion and stress. We ate later in the Indian restaurant at the hotel. The meal was ok but certainly nothing to rave about. And so to bed... Still no a/c of course but at least the bed had a wooden fan above it on the ceiling. I managed some sleep but my OH again was too hot and had to try to get some sleep outside on the balcony. This room was more up to date and also had a working fridge!  We tried to salvage our last day by shopping in the medina to be followed by what should have been a lovely evening dining in one of our favourite restaurants. We'd pre booked the restaurant through the hotel and had received emails from them confirming the booking.  A young guide was chosen by reception to walk us to our restaurant through the winding corridors of the medina. He said he would leave his telephone no. at the restaurant so we could call him to guide us back to the hotel. Nice touch we thought. At the restaurant they were very surprised to see us and asked whether we had booked. Of course we had and showed them the email confirmation of the booking from our hotel. Well no surprise by now to learn that our hotel hadn't booked the restaurant! In fact the restaurant would never have taken a booking for that time as there is only one service which started an hour earlier. At this point I just couldn't take any more and burst into tears. How could our hotel have even ruined this! Thankfully the wonderful staff and chef at GastroMK saved the night and made a special place for us (see separate restaurant review).  The hotel guide hadn't even left his no. at the restaurant so one of the hosts kindly walked us back to the hotel. The guide then greeted my OH with sneering and wanting payment - no chance! The GastroMk host had words with reception as he was very angry that they had messed up our booking like this. When he had gone the receptionist then laughed. I would gladly have strangled him had my OH not firmly guided me away!  Next day we packed and went to the rooftop to have lunch. Yet another cock up. I ordered lamb chops and was presented with a type of kebab and had to wait another 15 mins for it to be resolved by which time my OH had finished his meal. I couldn't wait to leave this god awful hotel.  Praise where it's due however to the Clarins spa. I had 2 massages as was suffering from stress and exhaustion as well as a very sore back. Both were excellent and the staff there were wonderful.  How on earth can a hotel get things so wrong one after another after another??! This could be a fabulous hotel as the setting and position is amazing. We were treated appallingly - absolutely no sense of customer care at all. This is the worst experience we have ever had at any hotel that we've ever stayed in.

Best value/price in the area.  Excellent location; 5 minutes walk far from the Medina area and square. Very convenient; no need to take taxis to visit the area.  Service was superb; very kind and helpful. They also recomended us Jawad a professional guide (he speaks 6 languages) to help us visiting the medina casbah and surroundings and also some touristic areas close to the city. He was very nice and professional with us and helped us with all our shopping.  The hotel has a very nice warmed pool on the roof with very nice view of the Koutoubia tower and the Atlas mountains. Gorgeous view.  They also have a cute bar to enjoy drinks and mint tea. Only they allow smokers ;-)  Breakfast buffet was good. Orange juice was superb; and the rest was a standard European breakfast buffet. Including bacon and eggs and also ham and sausages.  I'll stay there again if I come back to Marrakesh.,Date of stay: April 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Campello, Spain",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PedroL942

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,Phil C wrote a review Apr 2013,50,Perfect spot to explore Marrakech,We stayed here at the beginning of March and it is the perfect base to explore Marrakech. It is one street away from Djemaa El Fna which is the main square where all the action takes place and a 2 minute walk to the Souks. The main Mosque (Koutoubia Mosque) is pretty much at the end of the street - so if you don't want woken by the early moring call to prayers probably best keep your window closed. The hotel itself has 2 pools (one rooftop) and an indoor spa and pool. The piano bar is very atmospheric and all of the staff are very friendly and helpful. We really enjoyed it - felt it was much better value than the Mamounia which is also inside the Medina (and worth a visit for a beer). Other hotels are outside the Median and are all very pleasant but you really want to be in the heart of the city and the Koutoubia is the perfect spot .,Date of stay: March 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Stamford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PhilC295

The Hotel is very centrally located yet it is very quiet and one is only a short walk away from the Djemaa El Fna. The hotel rooms are very clean extremely delightful decorated and bright.  The central pool area is the diamond of this hotel the real oasis where one can relax under palm trees and listen to the birds. A real treat after a few hours full of live in the Medina of Marrakech. Every time we went through the hotel lobby it felt like all 100 TV channels of Marrakech life have been switched of and we entered another world.

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,AltPeter wrote a review Mar 2013,50,fantastic,We loved this hotel and stayed for 7 nights. We had room 75 which is located on the ground floor in the annexe next to the restaurant. It has it's own private archway entrance from outside to what could be described as a conservatory with furniture. The room was huge with another suite of funiture and the bathroom palatial. All beautifully decorated with roses or rose petals every day it felt very clean. I was concerned about getting a noisy room but this room was so quiet without neighbours a real haven. The central pool area is fabulous and beautiful both night and day it was just great to be there. The last few evenings were warm and it was nice to have a drink before going out to dinner. If you aren't staying here I would recommend calling in for a drink as it is so special.  We ate at the Indian on the first evening and it was perfectly enjoyable but not amazing compared to places at home. Breakfast is very good with a good choice.  The best thing about this hotel is that it feels very Morrocan without having to rough it and much. much nicer than a typical chain hotel which could be anywhere in the world. My wife says that we can not go back to Marrakech as it could never be as perfect as this trip and we would never get a room as nice again.,Date of stay: March 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Altrincham,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AltPeter
Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,Casssie1 wrote a review Mar 2013,50,Pleasant oasis right in the centre of the medina,The location of this hotel is absolutely amazing! You are right next to the Koutoubia which means as soon as you walk out the hotel you are in the hustle and bustle of the city. It still amazes me how it can be so noisy outside the hotel but as soon as you walk in you are in a peaceful hotel!    Breakfast was good with fresh crepes and eggs and omelettes made to how you want them.  We had dinner at the Indian restaurant which was called Jardin de Bala (i think?) where the food was nice but a bit salty and the atmosphere was a bit stuffy. We also ate twice at the french restaurant Relais de Paris which was nice service was amazing and food also quite nice.    The reception was incredible for the trip we asked them to book taxis restaurants and day excursions and were generally very helpful with all of our queries.    The fitness centre was well equipped and the spa was amazing! The piano bar was nice but I think it would be even nicer if the piano man didn't play to a soundtrack as I did think it was a little cheesy.    However I do agree that in comparison to an English 5 star hotel this hotel is not the same level however it still is very luxury!,Date of stay: March 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Casssie1
Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,Sueash52 wrote a review Mar 2013,50,Beautiful haven and sanctuary from crazy Marrakech,We stayed at this hotel for our anniversary weekend. We have been to Marrakech on 3 other occasions and each time we had lunched here so it was for us the perfect place to stay. Our room was overlooking central courtyard and pool it was lovely waking up to the birdsong. Everyday our room was cleaned and fresh roses laid out on our bed which was a lovely touch. The tv was also useful for one particularly rainy day as one channel showed back to back films. We had wifi in all areas including the roof top pool! We ate in the India restaurant La Bala which was ok and had lunch in poolside restaurant which was fine. The thing about Marrakech is that you need to appreciate the hustle and bustle smells and attack on all senses. Therefore staying somewhere like the Koutoubia helps you refresh and regroup before venturing out into the square.    I would also add that the breakfast was fab! A whole range of foods fresh crepes if you wanted them and also omelettes and fried or boiled eggs. Plenty to fill up on when you have a full days exploring ahead and nothing was too much trouble for the staff. There was a bit of work going on while we were there but it was discreet and we didn't let it affect us! It costs more than other places but with the surge in building and new riads/hotels cropping up in the city the Koutoubia is fast becoming as iconic as the Mamounia.,Date of stay: March 2013,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sueash52

We only had 3/4 days and wanted to stay in the thick of it but still have some peace and pool time and the Koutoubia fitted the bill perfectly.    Main attractions for me:  Location - just a few mins from Jamaa el Fna (main square)  Courtyard - gorgeous and peaceful unexpected considering hectic surroundings  Pools - both fab great having roof terrace pool for uninterrupted ray catching  Food - decent food in the hotel restos breakfast crepes were ace.  G&Ts - really nice to be able to get a good drink overlooking the lovely courtyard.    Downers:  Couple of moody French mulling around with noisy kids and the room was a tiny bit tired and not particularly inspiring.

The hotel is beautiful  just a short walk from the square. The setting is stunning  we were there when it was dark so the pool area was lit beautifully. We had a little walk around outside deciding if to sit outside or in. We chose in as it was a little cold. The staff were welcoming.    The Piano bar was quiet apart from the man singing at the piano. The bar staff were very friendly and chatty and we ended up sitting at the bar on three stools. We had our cocktails whisked up in front of us and they were delicious. Nuts & olives were flowing and used shells whipped away without us noticing ! We were celebrating a birthday and the man on the piano and the bar staff all sang Happy Birthday in English  French and Arabic !    We had a real laugh and would of stayed all night had we not had a dinner reservation. The cocktails were 70-80 Dh each  so about £5 - £6 cheap compared to London prices and worth it for a special start to an evening.,Date of stay: February 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,buckinghamshire,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kazza67

I booked last minute and in the rush it seems we double booked but once we got to the hotel the receptionist was happy to clear one of the rooms for no charge and no fuss. I hadn't told them I needed a car but once I arrived I called them for the address and the woman tried to see if they had one available alas they didn't but not a problem.    The location is insane. Jmaa El Fna and the Koutoubia Mosque are 3 steps away and the surrounding area has cash machines restaurants and the traditional souks to enjoy yourself in. You are right in the action.  When you enter the hotel however it is different. Well-secure high class and an elegant place with a fantastic piano bar and two great pools. The staff at both bars were so friendly and the indian restaurant was great.    To end with the value for money is good. We stayed for three nights made phone calls abroad used a laundry service which was fast and constantly used the concierge to make us bookings and what we paid was well well worth it.

It's not in the class of an internationally recognised 5 star hotel but for Morocco it is a class above mostly everything else. Lovely to see rose petals and roses used in our room. Staff were very friendly and attentive.    We had a room in the new/recently renovated Relais de Paris section. You had to actually go outside to get to to this normally not an issue in Morocco but for our stay it was cold and wet! Also the room had a strong smell of paint/paintstripper one day - I think they're doing work across the hotel as we heard occasional banging too but the smell went away and the work wasn't obtrusive. I couldn't connect my iPhone or iPad to the wifi in the room but could connect in the reception area.    We ate in all 3 hotel restaurants (rather than chancing our luck finding something outside or around the square) and we were very happy with them all. Yes they're more expensive than outside but we found the quality to be very good. The outside heated pool on the roof was nice if a little shallow to have a proper swim but the views were impressive.

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,jenny12368 wrote a review Feb 2013,40,Slightly shabby splendour but great location,I would agree with previous reviewers that this is not really a 5 star hotel more like a 4 star. It just doesn't have quite the luxury and attention to detail that I would expect for 5 star although some rooms are better than others. We had two rooms for our party of five which were next door to each other. However the room my parents were in had a terrible smell (a recurring theme on reviews) and they had to complain. They sent up the maintenance men and the smell got better but then recurred. In the end they moved my parents to what was a much nicer room but over in the annexe by the Relais de Paris restaurant. Lovely room but to get to it you had to go out of the hotel and down a short alley so they were miles away from the rest of us. We gathered from speaking to the public relations lady at the hotel that problems with smell are not uncommon. So if you have a problem I would suggest you just raise the issue with reception straight away and ask to be moved.  So saying this is still a lovely hotel and it's like a tranquil oasis when you come in from the city. It's so convenient for the square and for that reason if no other I would definitely consider it again. Breakfast was lovely loads of choice and we always found the staff to be friendly and helpful. We were there with two children and it was great to have so much space inside the hotel complex where they could safely roam and also things like the heated pool and snooker table.  Ate at the Moroccan restaurant at the hotel on the first night but this was expensive and the food was much less good than that which we had at the Marrakchi restaurant off the main square on a later night. Also the Imlil snack bar is really expensive for what you get.  All in all a lovely hotel but don't quite expect 5 star. Well worth considering though just for the amazing location.,Date of stay: February 2013,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Blackburn, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jenny12368

The waiters give excellent service and make very nice cocktails and table snacks always served. These are hotel prices though so be careful how many you have. It's a lovely looking hotel and seems to be a well kept secret as not very busy bearing in mind most restaurants in the area do not serve alcohol ad in sight if the mosque.

There were at times dust flying around constant banging drilling and workmen shouting. At one point we had no electricity in our room as it had been turned off (without warning) due to the fact that workmen were working on a lift. Staff at this hotel were very helpful if you gave them a tip! On checking our bill on the day of our departure errors were found and had to wait until these were rectified. Our credit card was handed over only to be rejected this threw us into panic as we have a substantial limit we then had to pay cash. Upon checking with our credit card company on our return home our credit card transaction was authorised in the UK but somehow the Morrocan system rejected it for some unknown reason.

Stay away from the Relias de Paris restaurant at this hotel staff need management direction none to be found sadly here. Chef thinks that if he ladens his food with salt it will taste better. Steak was as tough as old boots. The Asian/Indian restaurant on the rooftop of the hotel was a welcome delight all the staff and management were always pleasant caring and attentive.

Though it has surely lost its former grandeur the public spaces are still quite impressive and it retains plenty of advantages: its central and convenient location right near the Jemaa el Fna; enormous rooms with their own bath ""complexes""; a great hammam (though admittedly I have nothing to compare it to) with a beautiful heated underground pool (in addition to two outdoor pools); and a very extensive breakfast buffet (including made-to-order omelets as well as pork products). Everyone was nice the grounds were lovely and the staff at the front desk and restaurant spoke good English. On the down side it's hard to imagine why they keep the ratty red rugs in the hallways which make the place look like a flophouse. Simply replacing the rugs would do wonders! Similarly the extra touch of using fresh flowers everywhere was ruined because they are using dead roses. The room had multiple sets of interior doors (one to the toilet room another to the changing room) all of which had clunky pendant knockers that looked pretty but created a racket whenever you moved through them. In the winter the concrete bathroom and toilet room were quite cold. You had to go through two sets of doors to wash your hands after using the toilet. It took quite a long time for check in (we had to wait about 30 minutes to get into our room) but by the same token (and probably for this reason) they were quite generous about late check-out. If you're coming to Marrakesh for a honeymoon or to hang out in your room this is probably not the place for you.

We all had beautiful very large rooms very well appointed quiet and with roses refreshed every day.  The hotel pool with a great view of the Koutoubia is a great asset to bask in the winter sun. The pool itself is a little shallow to properly swim and is rather overheated at 32°C. For those who like to have a proper swim there is the large pool on the ground floor which unfortunately isn't heated so only to be used by polar bears in wintertime.  Being situated around the corner from Place Djemna El Fna the hotel makes a great place to venture into the medina. After strolling around the hustke and bustle of the town it is great to find this oasis your home.  Service was impeccable all over including all four restaurants. The Parisian pool restaurant and the Indian restaurant on the top floor are all excellent. The Moroccan restaurant comes out rather weak in comparison to the many good Moroccan restaurants in the neighbourhood.  We traveled with Jetair and our package included half pension. The breakfast was very sumptuous while you could choose to either use your main meal a la carte at one of the four restaurants either lunch or dinner.

It's a 5 minute walk from Jemaa El Fna and the sights and sounds of the city but once you go in it's an absolute haven. We were upgraded to a suite in the new part which was huge spotless and beautifully decorated Moroccan style- there was even an indoor fountain and rose petals were put everywhere. Sheets changed daily and service across the board was polite and very smiley. There are 3 restaurants- we were half board and it was a very good deal. Few issues for a vegetarian coeliac but I had a lot of omelettes and veggie tajines Indian restaurant was particularly good too. We had great weather for Jan and the heated pool on 3rd floor was a blessing as was the Clarins Spa. We did a couple of trips with a guide via the hotel which were just us so pretty laid back- 2 long days 1 into Atlas Mountains and 1 to Essouiria. They were good value and well worth the drives which were in very comfy 4 wheel drives. Loved the souks as ever and also the Marjorelle Gardens and a day of tombs storks and palaces- got lost but no-one anything but helpful. I reckon there is far less hassle then 10 years ago and people are just trying to make a living. A lot of smiling and polite thank yous go a long way wherever you are in the world.

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,ItalyFrancy wrote a review Nov 2012,50,AN OASIS IN THE HUSTLE AND BUSTLE OF THE MEDINA,This was our second stay. It is not a riad but an hotel. It is not new and to be honest it reflects this in some parts. Our room (2 adults + 6 year old child) was very big. It is close to a mosquee so you can hear the muezzin calling at 5.30 in the morning but it was not noisy it just added charme to the place. On the first day we found both our bed and the child's one covered with roses and petals and some fruit to be eaten. Good breakfast with also an egg station and a crepes one. Close to the swimming pool on the first floor there is the international restaurant where you can have salads and burgers for lunch. Before dinner we enjoyed a Negroni and a glass of wine (they brought some peanuts with them) in front of the swimming pool before having dinner in the Medina (where alcohol is forbidden in many restaurants beware!). The location could not be beaten; you turn the road and you find yourself in the Djeema el Fna but you are also close to Mohammed V avenue where you can catch a taxi to go wherever you want. The location of the famous hotel Mamounia is not at all so good as this one. Staff was very nice: a bee stang me one night and one of the piano bar waiter was so helpful to take off the bee point from my arm and to bring me some ice without even asking,Date of stay: November 2012,Trip type: Traveled with family,ITALY,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ItalyFrancy
Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,culturaDJ wrote a review Nov 2012,50,A true palace in the heart of the medina,This is a truly outstanding hotel. First of all it is huge but it never feels that way. The different sections of the hotel are all well furnished decorated and kept brilliantly. The rooms are huge (we had two fully equipped bathrooms!) and fairly quiet. Fairly because (as in many hotels) the cleaning crews start early and if that is in the room directly above you might as well get up - the noise! That same crew makes a pattern with rose leafs everyday on your bed - very romantic.  The hotel ouzes old world charm without it being opressive. The breakfast is great with fresh juices fruits all types of bread and anything you could wish for. The ground floor restaurant is also good but not outstanding. It is however on a much higher scale than any restaurant in the vicinity of the hotel so if you're not willing to walk in the dark medina or take a taxi you might as wll eat here. They make great cocktails (especially mojito's) in the pianobar but both me and my wife where wondering if there was any alcohol in them as we couldn't detect any. The location of this hotel is absolutely superb - right in the thick of it just a minute's walk from the main square. It is arguably the only five star hotel in the medina and that might well be true. The staff is attentive but not intrusive.,Date of stay: October 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Amersfoort, Netherlands",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/culturaDJ

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,KT_1000London wrote a review Oct 2012,40,"Excellent hotel and bar, service a bit hit and miss",The hotel is walking distance from the main square but you wouldn't know it once you're there as its so quiet and peaceful. It's a beautiful setting and very old school Marrakech.    Hotel decor is of good quality and the rooms were excellent although we were lucky and got an upgrade. This was a room along a passageway from the hotel and was actually above one of the restaurants which at first seemed a bit odd but was not a problem the especially when we had a bigger room and you couldn't hear a thing    Reception staff were mixed one chap was great and very helpful the woman there wasn't so helpful or knowledgeable which a bit frustrating when we were asking her advice on which restaurants to go to/how best to get there. You should watch out for the taxi they use outside the hotel (Mustafa) as well as he turned out to be a bit of a rip off - we nicknamed him Must-haffa-more-money!    The spa was excellent and reasonable value surprising for a good quality hotel which normally charge the earth. They were very accommodating with me moving appointments as well    The breakfast was average the service was too some of the waiters were a bit surly but it was a pleasant place to sit in any case with a coffee    Lunch - a fairly limited menu but it was all very nice. Again some waiters/waitresses were better than others -it seemed they were easily distracted and forgot to bring things we'd asked for so didn't exactly ruin the experience    The bar is great and probably worth a visit even if you're not staying as its such a lovely setting. The head waiter there was really good very attentive service all round.    We ate in the Indian restaurant which was very good we didn't go to the other two. The Moroccan one looked ok but we preferred to go out of the hotel to some of the more highly recommended restaurants arund the city.    Would highly recommend the hotel we really enjoyed our stay and its beautiful. It was full of various european visitors mostly french rather than British so you really feel like you've found a gem.,Date of stay: October 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KT_1000London
Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,2Hippos wrote a review Oct 2012,50,"Quiet oasis in the medina, well worth it's price",Writing this while still sitting in the hotel courtyard after four nights. Our experience couldn't have been any better. From the moment of arrival from the craziness of driving in this city (certainly wouldn't recommend that to anybody) in this oasis of calm and quiet and pleasant smells and very friendly as well as attentive staff until now we enjoyed every minute.    Don't want to repeat what other positive reviewers said as I can only confirm with their assessments. But to give a couple of examples of the attentiveness: previous guests of our room (very beautiful and very spacious junior suite) seemed to have taken the antenna cable of the TV as well as the hair dryer. Once we called the reception they replaced both within minutes. Nomad the bar waiter was together with the lady concierge (sorry don't have the name) the most friendly ones. We truly felt at home here.    If I would change one thing in this hotel it's the pianist who really isn't that fantastic however by not being that great he is very entertaining as well.    After reading comments about supposedly inattentive service I can only assume that these guest must have been the ones who are in general unfriendly with anyone working in service and not willing to tip. A couple of dirhams make things go a very long way in Morocco. Don't forget that people in the service industry are making a fraction a month of what you spend in a hotel like this per night.,Date of stay: October 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"New York City, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2Hippos

The hotel is as many have already described an oasis in the middle of the mayhem that is Marrakesh so location is perfect.    Room excellant and restaurants all apart from the International not actually connected to the hotel are worthy of a visit or even two. Indian and Paris are top notch and reasonably priced for 5*.    Quiet and relaxing no question and I found the staff friendly and helpful also....... albeit and only because we are talking 5* somewhat unattentive when it comes to the service around the pool area.

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,Aoife W wrote a review Oct 2012,40,"Traditional experience, great location",Stayed here with a group of friends/colleagues for 3 nights in early October. The hotel is lovely - traditional in style service is excellent and all staff are polite professional and courteous.  The hotel is not uber modern but still in good condition and very clean. If you are looking to stay somewhere with a more authentic feel this is a great option. There is a lovely courtyard in the centre with a pool lots of trees and a gorgeous smell of jasmine. The roof top pool is great and gives you sunshine all day long whereas the pool in the courtyard has shaded areas.  The spa I assume is a recent addition as it is much more modern than the hotel itself. We were accommodated for appointments for massage/hamman/etc at short notice which was great. The courtyard and bar are nice settings for evening drinks. There is plenty of choice for breakfast the food is all very fresh. Hotel is in a central location near the souks and other attractions but not at all noisy. The beds were the best part for me - I slept like a log!  We did a number of trips with a tour guide named Khalid Amor - he was fantastic and took us to places you would never find on your own as a tourist. The restaurants we visited were the best in Marrakech - Yacut being my favourite. Traditional Morrocan food (lots of it) with amazing views over the Medina. Dar Moha Bo & Zin and Jad Mahal were other restaurants we visited. The first being a traditional Morrocan restaurant the other 2 offered Asian and Morrocan food. Jad Mahal has traditional belly dancers which were very entertaining.

We were a little worried because we had seen mixed reviews but we need not have been. It was so much more than we could have asked for.    Hotel was stunning and the rooms were big and well appointed. We had no problem with air conditioning as has been reported in the past about this hotel and we ended up with two rooms as we were given a courtesy room on the last day of our stay as we flew in the evening and check out was at 12. (this was offered by the hotel and we were stunned to have been given such a service with no charge)    The hotel staff discover it was my birthday and surprised me in the restaurant on our last evening with a birthday cake and flowers.. again this was not something we had advised of or requested and it was a fantastic touch!    We loved being here. The spa was sensational    I would say that there are many great places to stay in Marrakech. We have visited a number of times and stayed in a lot of Riads.

The pool areas are loveley and we especially enjoyed the roof top area which is just perfect for sunbathing and lazing around.

It’s a very gentile quiet spacious place with lots of room to sit outside or by the two pools. We enjoyed speaking French (English is spoken but French felt more natural for all) and the service was excellent but not intrusive if you don’t ask you don’t get but that’s good for us we didn’t want to be bothered all the time. The breakfast choice is superb hot and cold with freshly cooked omelettes and pancakes and lots of fresh fruit and yogurt and honey etc. All the food is very good and not too pricey options immediately outside the hotel are limited so we ate in a lot and the poolside service was a special treat. We spent many hours happily sunbathing reading swimming or eating in between visiting the delights of the medina which does need escaping from after only an hour or two. The main square is a mere 2 minutes walk so popping in and out was easy and we liked knowing we could be ‘home’ the minute we decided enough was enough for our fragile European souls!,Date of stay: September 2012,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Dorset, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nmnewman

On arrive we were greated by our personal Kouni Rep very good english polite and incredibly helpful. We read reviews and was grateful that we got a room with working and quite air conditioning. The rooms was lovely large very clean and confortable 6 ft bed was great. The pool areas was delightful especially in early evening with a G&T. It was a wonderful feeling coming from the chaos of the market and souks entering the hotel door to find calm and peace. We ate in all three restaurants all good particularly the french restaurant; prices were very similar in all three and were as you would expect but not too over the top. All staff were helpful and friendly; service was good. We were pleased we only stayed here for three night not because of the lovely hotel but because of the hussle and bussle outside. we met Brit coming into the restaurant to eat who said that it was much better than their 5* in Merrakech. We then moved onto Agadir which was completely different. If we were to return to Merrakech we would definately come back.

For instance when we arrived at reception we received no greeting at all and the receptionist preferred to answer the phone rather than give us her attention. No concierge was available to give us any assistance and the maitre'd did not welcome us at breakfast. We were not supplied with water in the room and the air con was almost non existant.

So four of us tried.

That proved more difficult than we'd imagined... After 10 minutes of being ignored by two waiters I went to ask for menus. After another 10 minutes I went to ask them to come and take our order to be told to go back and get the order myself and bring it to the waiter. I did this like an idiot but when he suggested that I come back to collect the drinks and take them to the table myself even I balked.

When our room was ready at 930..the bell man took us over to see the upgraded room and to ensure we were happy before bringing our bags. We were given a suite but it was in a separate building which we were unsure of..so they showed us our original room and let us make the choice...how often does that happen!? Again a very nice touch. After checking in we throughly enjoy both pools very relaxing. No need to get up early to save loungers...there were plenty! Also the food at the restaurants was very good in particular the Indian one on the roof we ate there twice.  We found most of the staff very helpful and pleasant who were happy to give us directions and advice on pricing in the souks..what we should pay for certain souvenirs..which really helped in  our negotiations.

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,Neesa wrote a review Aug 2012,50,Lovely Hotel hidden in the city!,Along with my friend we visited marrakech for a week in July 2012 and it was hot!! Nearly 45degrees almost every day! So we loved our hotel because it was an amazing escape from the intense sun during the high sun.  We arrived at marrakech airport on a sunday afternoon and bought our currency at the airport from a buerue de change. We then went to get a taxi to the hotel which for the two of us with 2 small cases was 250dirhams. Now im sure we got ripped off but we were expecting to (think it should be no more than 200 dirhams so we didnt get ripped off too much!)  We arrived at the hotel after about 15 minutes and it was lovely!! There were bellboys at the door (we had no change for a tip but they didnt look like they would badger you for it).    The hotel is two floors of hotel rooms and the ground floor with restaurants spa etc. It is a jardin so there are pretty plants providing shade and breeze and in the centre there is a pool - this was perfect for the intense heat!! There was also a roof pool but we found in that heat it was too hot - we only lasted 10 minutes up there with no sun umbrella! They do have umbrellas and beds and towels for the pools however the roof one can be abit busier.    The hotel room was very nice although previous reviewers are right the air con is poor. However they do have fans above the beds so this is enough. To be honest the aircon in alot of hotel rooms are poor - you can see how they would struggle in such heat! Another negative point was the water - we had a bath with a shower over and it was standard - not power shower or a constant temperature however it was by no means a turn off for the hotel i would still go back and stay there again.    The main selling point for the hotel is that firstly its a family friendly hotel - from the pools to the food in the restaurants offering spaghetti and fries! Secondly the pool is a little oasis in the middle of marrakech! And thirdly the location. The location was amazing!! You could walk to new town in about 20 minutes though in that heat it took us about 30-45 minutes if we sat along the way. There were lovely icecream parlours on the way (Dinos was amazing) and a mcdonalds in the new city. Koutoubia was literally 2 minutes down a road. Opposite that road a 5 minute walk took you to the main square for yummy fresh orange juice. We often went there in the evenings and ate in one of the restaurants overlooking the square/markets and people watched into the late evenings. And going opposite to the new city for about 20 minutes took you to the palaces. The only thing we took a cab for was the majorelle gardens which were beautiful.    Breakfast was included with our trip and it was a light buffet lunch. they had pancakes fresh fruit yoghurt cereal dried fruits toast eggs (though they sometimes undercooked this for us) - it wasnt a full english but there was enough to be had for sure. And orange juice - plenty of it!    We took two excursions from the hotel via an expedia tour agent - one to trek the atalas mountains and eat at the berber village where the tagines were to die for (~1.5hr drive; trainers needed not for the light hearted) and the second to the ouzaid waterfalls which was stunning (3 hour drive well constructed steps take you to 3 levels of the waterfalls; do not need trainers and low fitness should be fine)    We took about £200 each to exchange into dirhams and due to the excursions and the continuous thirst we found we actually needed £250 each for 6 nights in marrakech. That was plenty for food drink excursions and souveneirs.    All in all i would recommend this hotel and go again.,Date of stay: July 2012,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Neesa

In fact the square is almost outside it. Yet when you enter the front door you are met with total calm tranquilit and professionalism.    The rooms are excellent and as the photos on here show the housekeeping staff keep them clean and enticing with rosepetal and towel formations!    There are three restaurants. We tried them all and found the food to be tasty and well presented. On occasions the service was a tad random but we found that was so in many Marekech eateries. It becomes part of the charm.    The hotel staff were very helpful and knowledgeableand if small niggles arose (like no water in the minibar) they rectified this imediately with no fuss.    The pool area is well maintained and one can laze about there to be served with snacks drinks or towels!    We met several people who were on return trips to the hotel because they had enjoyed it so much previously. We woul dreturn without hesitation.    I have to mention the piano bar.... we were in hysterics most nights as the piano man coul dneither sing nor play the piano really. WE went to the bar each evening for a Koutoubia cocktail very yummy and to play 'guess the tune' form the piano man. Priceless!

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,Londontannedd wrote a review Aug 2012,40,An Oasis in the Chaos,It's fair to say that this hotel is in probably one of the greatest locations in Marrakech. We were looking for a hotel in the old town with a proper pool; while there are many amazing hotels many of them don’t have anything more than a paddling pool on the roof. However this hotel is approximately 250 meters from the Square and the souk and slap bang in the middle of the crazy life that is Marrakech.    We were upgraded on arrival to a suite which was very kind and unexpected the room was very spacious clean comfortable. We did think that being so close to the hustle and bustle we would hear the outside noise however we heard nothing (not even the call to prayer from the main Mosque which was only a couple of 100 meters away. The only slightly downside was that the aircon in the room seemed to struggle with the heat and at night it was warmer than you would like however it was 46oC during the day so we weren’t really surprised!!  As for the hotel yes it is a bit dated but it has a wonderful colonial feel to it. The pool area is great to spend the afternoon relaxing. The Spa is great (top end prices though) the food and drink within the hotel is great. The staff are so friendly. If fact I have pretty much nothing negative to say about this hotel.

Situated in the cities old-town (The Medina) I knew I was home as soon as I walk though the front doors. I checked in for 7 nights and never looked back... blissful could only describe the well kept surrounding of this larger than normal boutique hotel. In anyone’s standards this was truly 5 star. I met several of the hotel guests during my stay; some of who were British American but most were obviously French.    The hotel has several outdoor swimming pools as well as a wellbeing underground pool in the hotel's luxury spa. The main pool area was situtated in the hotels courtyard area. It had plenty of clean comfortable sun-loungers shaded with Palm-trees. The noise from the hustle & bustle from Marrakech's noisy streets was completely blocked by the shape of the hotel... With only the sound of birds in the overhanging palm-trees I had to keep reminding myself I was in the middle of a busy city. Marrakech Square is only 5 minutes away a place everyone goes of an evening. The Souk’s busy backstreets surround the hotel from all areas. To soak-up the Moroccan experience I had picked a hotel ‘right-bang-smack’ in the perfect location.    A full breakfast service was available to all guests in the hotel’s ground floor restaurant and poolside terrace. By day… soft drinks coffees teas beers light lunches & ice cream were served to you by the pool our nearby restaurant’s terrace. Of an evening the hotel’s three truly wonderful restaurants opened for dinner. The main eatery was the ground floor Moroccan Restaurant. Close by the hotel’s gardens were turned into a wonderful international restaurant serving tasty meats chicken fish and vegetable dishes. On the hotel’s rooftop terrace restaurant we were delighted by the flavours of Asia… the ‘Les Jardin’s de Bala’ Indian Restaurant. By day they served light Asia snacks and meals either in the restaurant or by the rooftop poolside but by evening the ‘Les Jardin’s de Bala’ burst into life… ‘Indian style’. The food and service were wonderful in all restaurants.    Our hotel suite was clean modern & very spacious. It had a large balcony overlooking the hotel’s garden 2 large wall mounted LCD Televisions with a few English speaking news and movie channels plenty of wardrobe space large bathroom with separate bath & shower... but most importantly of all... a very comfortable bed.    My stay at the 'Les Jardins de La Koutoubia' was perfect in every way but its friendly staff made my visit most memorable a special mention to ‘Kareem’ one of the hotels young concierge staff… he was so welcoming friendly & helpful when we arrived. If I ever return to Marrakech I will most definitely stay at this hotel.,Date of stay: July 2012,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Ballymena, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R_Kernohan

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,Jenfez wrote a review Jul 2012,50,Perfect.,My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel for 5 nights in July and absolutely loved it. I don't really have anything negative to say about it.    The hotel has an excellent location right next to the main square. It is on a very busy street but it really is incredibly relaxing and quiet inside. The pool area was very quiet and clean and you could order food and drinks (there are two outdoor pools-one in the central courtyard and one on the roof-both were lovely). You could also get a bed by the pool easily anytime.    The room was lovely with small moroccon pastries in the room on arrival. It was nice and clean with a lovely view out to the central courtyard and pool. It was also nice and quiet. It is true that the air-conditioning was not very strong (there is also a ceiling fan) but we were there in July and found the temperature at night with the air-con and ceiling fan on was fine.    The hotel itself is lovely and in a traditional design. The bar area and seating outside were nice and we enjoyed having a drink there in the evening. The cocktails were really good. The staff at the bar were also very friendly and attentive.    Food- we ate at both the moroccan restaurant and the indian rooftop restaurant in the hotel and had really good meals in both. We also ate lunch in the poolside bar and the food there was really good and reasonably priced compared to other 5* hotels in Marrakech that I have visited.  We also ate out in Marrakech and the hotel reception were very helpful in recommending places and booking tables for us. They were also very helpful in getting us a taxi out in the evening if we needed it. I found that everyone working there had good English.  Breakfast was pretty good with all the things you need and they also make crepes.    We would definitely stay at this hotel if we return to Marrakech. Overall i'd say that it had a nice character and the staff were really welcoming and helpful so we really had a great experience.,Date of stay: July 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Bern, Switzerland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jenfez

The lobby is quite impressive specially when you see the swimming pool area outside.  Breakfast is ok but they have a bar on the roof (with another swimming pool) where they serve indian tapas. OMG! Try them!  In the evening try their delicious tagine (careful huge portion).  The rooms are good and their spa is just like heaven.  Super location maybe even too close to the market :)  Be careful with some strange people coming and offering to take you to a tour. The hotel has some people for that and they are really good. One of them took us shopping on the good stores hidden and interesting spots for a really fair price.,Date of stay: August 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Zurich, Switzerland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnDreams84
Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,Pablo A wrote a review Jul 2012,50,Nice Hotel Boutique...,Location Location Location....  This beautiful Hotel is located next to the Medinas and the main Plaza. You can feel really safe visiting the traditional market and the Plaza late at night.  The Hotel layout follow traditional Morrocon architecture meaning all spaces are open towards a central patio this time filled up with a gorgeous pool.    Room sizes are large enough to accommodate an spacious sitting area and a comfortable queen bed daily decorated with different rose petals. Bathroom area has a separate toilet room.If you travel with friends the corner rooms shares a terrace perfect for an evening email check (internet is free) and night activities planning.    The staff is very friendly and fluent in French English and some Spanish and in Morocco that's a plus.    Breakfast buffet is well provided and satisfies diversities from plain cereals to elaborated pottage. In house you can choose from three different restaurants Morrocan Indian and International with hi end setups but lacking a very short menu and almost no wine options    The Piano Bar is well provided and with elegant sitting areas perfect hideout where you can enjoy a generous drink while waiting for your wife to get ready.    The Clarins Spa is great make sure you call in advance to get the Vapor room ready... it's a must !!,Date of stay: June 2012,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Miami Beach, Florida",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pallamand
Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,taz9123 wrote a review Jul 2012,40,More a 4 star than a 5 but great location,Awful start to a holiday when you exit an airport and the taxi cab drivers shout abuse at you for not wanting to pay 4 times over the odds for a cab ride. 80dhm is approximately what you should be looking at. Absolutely roasting at the mo with humidity at about 100%. Good long daylight hours with hot nights. Didn't see any mozzies. Great location for the hotel- needs more attention to detail to bring this up to a good 4 star. Most hotels do themselves a dis-service by overselling themselves. Structurally beautiful with high ceilings and authentic furniture pieces. The B.A Rep was selling very overpriced excursions which you can pick up for alot less anywhere else (NB. haggle) Pool side drinks are very expensive- especially when they are being presented in just a can. An advantage if you can speak french/morrocan as very little english is spoken by key hotel personnel (reflected in cable tv channels- only 2 in english). Internet works sporadically. The pool side is un-manned for 95% of the time. Towels are limited on a first come first served basis. Sun beds were comfortable with plenty of shaded seating areas. The pool and surrounding areas were kept clean. I had read on other reviews that the a/c didn't always work; unfortunately this problem continues. It really is no joke in those kind of temperatures. We did have a lovely big room with 2 a/c units the one nearest the bed didn't work properly and sounded like a drilling machine. Nights were very uncomfortable as the ceiling fans only moved the air around and the beds are made up of a duvet when a thin sheet is all that is required. There is no view to speak of as the curtains need to remain drawn to keep the sun out. The curtains are made up of a heavy material and a black out curtain. Nothing inbetween which would allow you to enjoy looking out over the pool; as soon as you draw back the curtain you are looking directly into someone elses room. Very intrusive. This also meant that the windows remained closed and the toilets had very poor extraction fans. Not a very plesant aroma. A cool box would remain colder than the fridge. There is not enough hanging space in the small closet and no hooks to hang towels up in the shower room. The bedside lights didn't work on the left side of the room which was annoying as the whole room would then have to be lit up when reading at night. Breakfast is clean and plentiful with a large variety. Ask for Nescafe if you can't handle the local gloop. The orange juice is delicious. Bewarned that pick pockets and beggars are rife outside/in the market. Be warned to keep your wits about you when outside the hotel; you'll get jostled spoken to rudely dismissed with a hand gesture and ladies WILL get groped. Personal space is not respected. Be aware when eating outdoors as we were duped/lured into a restaurant only to be told that they served a 3 course set menu at an extortionate price (after they'd sat us down and taken drinks orders) The price for a carriage ride should be around 200Dhms for the hour irrespective of how many of you get in the carriage. Everyone is out to put one over on you needless to say I wont be going back. The food in the hotel pool bar is definately worth the price. Well presented fresh and authentic. Chocolate milkshake is highly recommended. Be warned the lifts regulary break down. The spa seems very over priced therefore empty.The points I have made all seem small but when you put them all together a 5 star hotel it does not make...BUT a lovely 4 star which I would recommend.,Date of stay: July 2012,Trip type: Traveled with friends,Staines,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/taz9123
Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,jrh2020 wrote a review Jun 2012,40,"Great physical property, horrible attention to detail",This hotel is a complete enigma. On one hand you have a beautiful physical property that is perfectly situated and provides a sunny oasis from the bustling city. Pool scene is quiet and luxurious restaurants are delicious and relatively high end piano bar offers refreshing cocktails by the pool western style brunch...all pretty solid. We were even upgraded to a mini-suite upon arrival free of charge. But I've been fooled on first dates before. As I got to know the property better say on day 2 and 3 I began to encounter a frustrating and at times off putting lack of attention to detail. Where to begin? Day 1 my air conditioner unit did not work and my room was unbelievably hot. Repairmen came but were unable to fix the problem. Day 2 we switched suites into a unit with a balcony (upgrade?). Although we got the balcony we also became proud owners of an undrainable / overflowing shower an ant infestation a repeatedly dysfunctional keycard for our door and spotty wifi at best (actually didn't work at all in new room). Also the spa and pool area is very nice however the tiny 2 machine gym is legitimately a safety hazard for adults over the age of 25. The 100 degree gym temperature might be bad enough but when combined with a humid sauna and no circulation it is essentially a heat death trap waiting for some overweight 50 year old man to stroke out. Still all this aside - I actually want to really like this hotel. We spent a few overall very pleasant days by the sultanesque pools (main and roof deck) and ate two really great meals in the garden and roof area. The manager was very helpful when I asked for help both in switching my room and in booking us a great tour guide. He is doing his very best to make it a great experience but the hotel simply needs a bit more money to focus on some details. Overall perfect location in dead center of city for site seeing great pool and restaurant scene friendly staff BUT pathetic lack of attention to functioning of a/c units showers ants keycards gym and other small tidbits. I'm giving this 4 stars because it's a great oasis but really it's a 5 star property in location and room size with 3 star attention.,Date of stay: June 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,New York,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jrh2020

This hotels is special in the way that we automatically felt like ""at home"" when we arrived. We had already been there for a fe drinks in a previous trip some years ago and we really wanted to come back.  The location is excellent very close from the koutoubia and from the Jema Elfna square : convenient for going out and also to find the way back!  The hotel has the shape of a riad with an inner garden and pool with birds and flowers... its like an oasis after a long day outside around the medina or in the souks under 35°...  Very relaxing.  It is true that there is not much variation for the breakfast or for the snack menue but I think this is the same in every hotel (it is difficult to reinvent brakfast...)

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,Dlmmcfadden wrote a review Jun 2012,40,Hotel ratings,Hi    My partner & I stayed at the Les Jardins de La Koutoubia hotel for 4 nights before heading to Casablanca.    It is a lovely hotel and the main advantage is location..location...location. The reception staff were nice but we had to ask for things about 3 times cause they were busy.    Lack of wi-fi was a pain as we had to move around to gain access to the internet. It was doing our heads in!!!!    Hotel - is clean & serves fab cocktails around 80 dirhams each..expensive but good for a special occasion or if you wish to relax by the lovely pool. Breakfast is fab. They serve everything you could possibly want. You must ask them for more orange juice which was a pain considering we paid 5* prices & they should constantly top your glass up. This is a minor thing really.    People staying there - was a complete mixture from your model types who hit the trendy joints of Marrakesh @ night & lots of couples as well. Mainly French of course who dress to impress. Dress code is very relaxed as I was causal throughout.    Fridge - our fridge wasn't working but we didn't complain. Overall a lovely hotel with a great location..fab breakfast & nice staff. It is very clean which is my main concern.,Date of stay: June 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Guia, Portugal",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dlmmcfadden
Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,SEAsiafan145 wrote a review Jun 2012,30,"Great place for a day visit, otherwise overpriced and in need of better management and maintenance",We stayed at this hotel on a friend's recommendation having spent a few previous days in a stunning Riad in the Medina. In hindsight we should have stayed in the Riad. This hotel has beautiful grounds and public rooms full of bird song and flowers around a large lovely courtyard with a swimming pool. It has a great location as well. We would recommend it for a day visit as you can pay to use the pools and access the public areas and restaurants on a 'day pass'. The Indian restaurant on the Terrace with a great view of the main Mosque was very good.  However we would not recommend a stay here as it is very over-priced for what it is now as  the hotel appears to be suffering from a lack of effective management. Our rooms were large and nicely decorated. However it had poorly functioning air-conditioning which despite three requests for attention and intervention left our rooms hot and stuffy at night making sleeping difficult. It was also venting air from the kitchens below so the room smelt of stale oil. The shower sumps did not drain properly and the carpets whilst cleaned daily were clearly in need of replacement. Our request to change rooms was gently batted away by Reception. The hotel is generally very clean the common areas are certainly beautiful and aesthetically pleasing. However it is the small things that let down a hotel of this nature boasting 5 stars. At early morning breakfast which is a very good buffet the cleaning staff were still out mopping sweeping and vacuuming amongst the hotel guests. Something that should have been done at 6am before breakfast service has started. Despite this evidence of cleaning the sun loungers by the pool were never lifted for cleaning and a carpet of discarded nutshells cans and other detritus could be seen from eye level when swimming in the pool. Not nice.  Definitely worth a day visit but avoid staying here it is not worth the price despite the fantastic location.,Date of stay: June 2012,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SEAsiafan145
Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,MMK3 wrote a review Jun 2012,40,convenient position and attractive grounds,We spent a week here in May; the weather was perfect and this our most convenient hotel in all our four visits to the city over recent years. It is a stone's throw from the Jemaa el f'na and souks as well as the Koutoubia mosque and gardens. It's not far from the Mamounia either if you fancy an expensive drink and a spot of Russian oligarch-spotting in the beautiful gardens! Food in the restaurants was good and the staff helpful: we had a 6am start on the day we left and they arranged a light breakfast for us with coffee and rolls.  The only drawback was the airconditioning which gave off a strange and unpleasantly stale smell; as it was early in the year the ceiling fan was enough to keep the room cool but it would be a different matter in high summer.,Date of stay: May 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London EC1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MMK3

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,minibreaker89 wrote a review Jun 2012,40,Well located for key sites and a welcome oasis from hustle and bustle,As other reviewers state this hotel benefits from a brilliant location - immediately next to the main square souks Koutoubia mosque and gardens. When the activity outside becomes too much it's great to step through doors into calm interior. Public spaces are spacious our room was great - very large with a beautiful bathroom with large bath and shower very large balcony with sun shades (an 'inner patio room' in separate patio area that annexes the main hotel building). A lovely touch was different arrangements of rose petals on the bed each night. We ate at the Indian restaurant and found the food flavoursome and we also enjoyed the salads at lunchtime in the restuarant adjoining main pool area. The main pool is reasonably large with plenty of sunbeds (the pool attendant was pretty good at clearing used towels and freeing up beds) plus an unexpected pool on the roof. The spa facilities were good although my husband objected to paying for use of the steam room.,Date of stay: May 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,london,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/minibreaker89
Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,Vaquitalekker wrote a review Jun 2012,40,An oasis in the city,The Hotel is very beautiful and close to the Jemaa el Fna souks and all the attractions that this magical city has to offer. Indeed its location was one of the best assets helping us to escape from the hustle and the heat whenever we wanted.    The staff in general was very friendly and accommodating. They were fluent in French English and Spanish making everyone in our party feel welcomed.    The Hotel has 2 wonderful outdoor swimming pools: one in the main patio surrounded by palm trees and cushioned lounge chairs and the one located in the rooftop with direct view to la Koutoubia tower. In both areas pool butters offer towels and drinks but it is better to retrieve them since they take a long time to deliver them. Nevertheless we highly appreciated the complimentary fruit skewers offered while sunbathing.    The rooms are clean and surprisingly large; we never expected to have separated living area to sit and enjoy a lazy afternoon. Even more surprising our room had a second bathroom! Airco is mild so do not expect to have polar air even if you set up the temperature to zero.    We have a nice experience with our room with rose and petals decorating the bed the bathrooms and the living. However my friends suffered different problems with their room: first with the not working airco and second with almost two days without electricity. The Hotel was fixing a general problem in that floor but they did not inform the guests about the work in progress and its consequences. Because the Hotel was fully booked it was not possible to move them to another room.    Breakfast was great boasting different pastries breads rolls crepes omelettes fresh fruit great coffee and different type of yogurts. We sat everyday outside the pool to enjoy the warming up morning and the birds chirping in the patio. Super...    The Hotel boasts 3 restaurants: one French one Moroccan and one Indian/Asian cuisine with good food and attentive service. We enjoyed our Moroccan dinner with live music and a belly dancer.    The bar at the patio is great for an afternoon drink while the one in the roof is good to chill out along the swimming pool.    The Clarins Spa is great. We had the traditional Hammam ritual and it was fantastic. We were so pleased that we brought home some of the products. The hairdresser also did a great job caring for my hair. In addition there is a third pool inside the SPA but only available for a fee or free of charge if you are taking any of the treatments.    In general we had a wonderful time in Les Jardins de la Koutoubia and I probably will go back.

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,Hushahlondon wrote a review Apr 2012,50,Lovely oasis of calm and tranquility,We stayed here in the peak summer season and chose it because if its locality and reviews.  Indeed it was a fabulous place to retire to once the expeditions of the jema el fna were over for the day. It is painfully close ( literally a 1-2 minute walk) to The Place yet exudes auch calmness that you feel like you have left that hustle bustle so far back.  Once inside the hotel you can enjoy brilliant service from reception and concierge service. The pool is just ahead through the doors that divide the riad style courtyard from the lovely reception area. The rooms we stayed in was a junior suite and was lovely with a outside seating area next to another pool and the french themed restaurant Relais de Paris- lovely food and waiters.  There is a spa and hamam service available with Clarins and was also a lovely experience. A small clean gym area is located near the spa. The breakfast area is by the pool or just inside if you like to stay near the serving area and the staff again more than happy to assist. The breakfast though repetitive is nice and filling but of kot much variety- continental.  There is a piano bar just besides the reception on the right and is quite nice in the evenings. Besides the pool areas there are several rooms for ones relaxation and a pool table with tv too.  On the terrace there is another pool and is quite popular during the summer. There is a nice indian themed restaurant too - a little pricey and service can be slow but the food is delicious.,Date of stay: July 2011,,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hushah

On approach to the hotel entrance we wondered what we had gotten ourselves into. But you walk through the doors into a lovely oasis. The grounds are very pretty and the service was wonderful. We were upgraded to a suite and the room was gorgeous. And everything was spotlessly clean. The hotel is just around the corner from the main square so the location is excellent if you like to be in the middle of the action. We ate lunches by the main pool and although simple the food was good. We ate at Narwama the restaurant between two sections of the hotel and really enjoyed our meals and the atmosphere.

We didn’t use the spa because it was ridiculously expensive: extra expense on high room rate no thanks. Free wi-fi works only at the reception lobby and hardly even there. Hotel’s Moroccon restaurant was bad experience very expensive and just a poor and tasteless food we got better food at Jemaa El Fna food stalls.,Date of stay: March 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Helsinki, Finland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Saija_67

The hotel is nice and pool is between trees a real pleasure. Staff is very kind and helpful. Rooms are not very big but are nice decorated. Although there were some bugs (bathroom is made of stone and wood) and breakfast was a little poor I have to say that location is perfect and the hotel is nice and comfortable.,Date of stay: October 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Madrid, Spain",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cristinaallendesalaz
Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,angelakstone wrote a review Mar 2012,50,Another excellent stay,This is our 4th trip to the hotel - so yes we love it!    It's extremely well situated a couple of minutes from both Koutoubia Mosque and the square. The style is traditional Moroccan so if heavy wood tobacco coloured walls old red rugs and an eclectic mix of local artwork ornaments furniture and subtle lighting aren't your thing this may not be for you.    Reception staff are very helpful and if you've booked without a travel company they are excellent at organising anything you might want to do and providing any information you might need. The receptionist picked up that while we were there it was my birthday so I was surprised with a birthday cake at breakfast!    Our room was delightful we had a suite with a small sitting area and a patio area outide. All amenities are in the room except tea and coffee making facilities. So no need of a hairdryer shampoo etc. Safes in the room are roomy and there was lots of strorage space.    Breakfast is a good spread with lots of variety: an egg station fruits cereals and yoghurts bread cakes and some hot food. We occassionally eat lunch around the pool which might be considered expensive but the food quality is excellent. We tried all 3 restaurants (French Indian and Moroccan) on this trip and weren't disappointed with any. Food variety is good well cooked and the service of the restaurant staff is excellent.    The piano bar is lovely for a drink to unwind after the chaos of the square and the staff are both polite and attentive.    There are 3 pools included one which is heated and a Clarins spa (though we didn't visit the spa)    All in all an excellent 5 star hotel if like us you prefer to avoid the chain hotels.,Date of stay: March 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Manchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angelakstone

From outside the hotel looks ordinary but inside it has great character. We were met on arrival with a cup of mint tea while our registration process was completed and were upgraded to a room overlooking the square around which the hotel rooms are located. The square contains a good sized swimming pool with very comfortable seating areas and there is another pool on the roof top where you can sunbathe even in February. The rooms are well furnished with a large king sized bed rather firm but pleasant.  The bathroom is well equipped and the TV has numerous channels in English. The hotel has 2 good restaurants one serving Moroccan food the other French. In the evening there is a piano bar and outside a fire was lit for us to sit around the pool. Staff are incredibly helpful and friendly.

Unfortunately our room was not ready for half an hour so we relaxed for a while.  Room was lovely rose petals everywhere !!(only on the first day). Everything you needed including an easily operated safe!  The setting was lovely we overlooked the main pool and the sun decks and heated pool on the roof was great.  There are 3 restaurants we ate in each of them over the 3 nights we stayed. Food OK not a great choice and would get bored if we had stayed longer - perhaps the menus are extended in busier times. The French restaurant was a let down in terms of service they forgot our starter altogether and when reminded delivered it with the main!  Breakfast was great and the hotel staff were excellant.    The hotel is slap bang in the middle of things so be prepared to be jumped on the minute you set foot onto the street.

We stayed in a mini-suite which was spacious and very well-equipped with a comfortable seating area and balcony overlooking an inner garden. It was very quiet and a welcome retreat after a day walking in the souk etc. The breakfast (included) was an excellent buffet with a chef making omlettes and cooked eggs to order and plenty of fruit bread cereals etc. We also enjoyed dinner our first night at the hotel's Moroccan restaurant with a good choice of dishes.

Got a great deal on a Patio facing room and breakfast by searching hotel booking websites. Room was large and well appointed with separate seating area and good sized bathroom. Public areas are reminiscent of the type of hotel you expect Poirot to appear in! Lovely large pool with pretty gardens on one side which house a delightful restaurant where lunch is served. Hotel has 3 restaurants for dinner - we ate in the french one in the modern annexe and in the Moroccan one where we were lucky to have traditional musicians and a belly dancer. Piano bar does a nice range of cocktails and we thought the breakfast was excellent - try the pancakes with fresh figs and fig jam!! The real plus for this hotel is the location - 2 minutes from the square and the Koutoubia mosque.

But aiming at a confortable and elegant hotel not too big centrally located in La Medina with a set of very nice relaxing areas like a Spa and 3 swimming pools one of them in a splendid terrace looking the Koutobia Minaret and the red roofs of this enchanting town Les Jardin de la Koutoubia is the ideal choice.  I found a very good level of service nice and wide rooms elegant common areas with a deep touch of moroccan design also if not extremely refined.  The only contraint is that the SPA use and especially the use of internal swimming pool is not included in the rate of the room.  Breakfast instead included is in the average with not a wide range of choices.  Overall taking into consideration the position the service level and the fantastic outdoor pool on the roof especially pleasant for europeans during their winter time and the appropriate (but not low) price Le jardins de La Koutoubia has fully satisfied our expectations.,Date of stay: November 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Milan, Italy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lionitaly

The international restaurant downstairs had a romantic setting and the food was good.. Breakfast was fine although some mornings the staff were very slow in replenishing the buffet. I think it's more of a 4 star hotel as far as service is concerned.  The air conditioning worked well-in fact i had to turn it off in the middle of the night. I got woken up by the early morning chants but it didn't last long.  My only complaint is the piano player-he just can't sing and play the piano and most of the time he wasn't in tune.

We were there for a special anniversary week end and were upgraded to a suite on the top floor and our daughters to a junior suite and I had already negotiated a very keen price. so don't be afraid to ask everything in morocco is negotiable!

The room (we were lucky enough to have a junior suite) was spacious clean very comfortable and well decorated aswell as having a private patio area.

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,Emma7272 wrote a review Aug 2011,40,People love to moan.....,Just arrived back from a 4 night stay at this hotel. Firstly let me assure you that we have travelled all over and are not novices.    I cannot understand some of the previous reviews on here at all. The hotel is great and so tranquil. It is literally on the Medina yet once inside you cannot hear the noise or smell the traffic fumes. We were never woken up by the mosque at 5am (I am a very light sleeper). The staff were fantastic and we did not once find them unfriendly or unhelpful in fact quite the opposite. The room was lovely. The pools are lush with beach towels provided. We had a couple of things in our room break / go wrong but they were fixed immediately.    The food in the restaurants was great and breakfast was also very nice standard for anywhere abroad. They even had bacon!    My only complaint is the air con as others have mentioned. It is not just particular rooms but speaking to other guests is standard in the hotel. I am afraid it is just not good enough when it is 43 – 49 degrees!!!! There was a ceiling fan and that with plenty of wine/beer enabled us to sleep. I would not recommend this hotel for the summer months. It is the worst air con I have ever experienced in the world!    However the hotel is absolutely charming and kind of a boutique style with lovely little chill out rooms off the pool area. Full of character etc. I am normally hard to please but I would definitely go back here – but not in July / Aug.    Marrakech was an experience! Not really for me. Too crowded hot polluted smelly and with blatant displays of animal cruelty that I prefer to pretend does not exist.    We ate in the hotel mostly and when we did venture out to eat on the stalls in the Medina (as recommended on TA) we ended up with food poisoning! Note: The airport when trying to leave is an absolute nightmare BTW. Maybe we left on a bad day but it took 2 hours from once checked in to get to the gate!!!!,Date of stay: August 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,England,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Emma7272

Beautiful swimming pool with very comfortable sunbeds!  Despite other reviews I found service to be very good at reception and in the restaurants cleanliness of the hotel was excellent however the maid didn't mop the bathroom floor once in 7 days as we had a few bugs which met a grisly end that were never swept up!  Breakfast was plentiful even if it was the same every day we were half board and ate at the pool bar moroccain and the Indian all very nice although some didn't open til 8pm a little late sometimes.  Drinks were expensive £4 a small beer but wine starting at £13 a bottle better value.  All in all this is a great hotel very boutique style to it right in the heart of the medina a bit noisy with mosque every morning at 4am tho! I got a great deal as I work in the travel industry so I'm not sure if it is worth the advertised £350 a night for the suite but if you can get a good deal I would definately give it a try.,Date of stay: July 2011,,"Southport, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trolleydollyjo

The bottom line is that we will not be returing to this hotel. Here is the good and the bad:    The Good  • The location is definitely as convenient as advertised on two fronts. First it is literally 2 minutes from the medina and main square. You really cannot be better located. Second it is located right across from the Koutoubia Mosque which is an ideal landmark for the geographically challenged in the ever confusing streets of Marrakech!  • The spa...the spa. Brittany described it as the best spa experience of her life.    The Bad  • The hotel has definitely seen better days -- like during the Chirac Adminstration. :) The furniture and red carpets are worn. We were left with the impression that this place was the hot spot in the 1990s but a lot of time has marched by since then. Unfortunately it is priced for its 1990s glory rather than its current state.  • The front desk staff could be described as unfriendly - and worse as willing participants in the ever present ""shakedown"" of Marrakech. We were actually overcharged upon checking out of the hotel. It was probably only $20-40. However it was irksome when the reservation agent acknowledged there was a mistake and then told us to handle it with Priceline - or call back later. He made no attempt to fix the problem.  • The food in the hotel provides variety - Indian Morrocan French International - but unfortunately nothing is special about the food. You are better off eating at Cafe Arabe (http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293734-d1070587-Reviews-Cafe_Arabe-Marrakech.html) Terrase des Epices(http://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Restaurant_Review-g293734-d1740685-Reviews-La_Terrasse_des_Epices-Marrakech.html) or elsewhere.  • We were supposed to have complimentary breakfast with our reservations but the hotel would not honor -- even when it was clearly marked on the confirmation.  Btw we had absolutely great experiences at all other hotels/riads in Morocco.    Happy travels!

It’s a charming property on the edge of the Djemma al Fan’aa square. The pool area is an oasis of calm in this otherwise frenetic city and the rooms are comfortably furnished the staff generally cheery and helpful and the three restaurants each serve a fine menu of International Moroccan and Asian dishes.  But - and it’s a BIG but. After I had settled the bill (of something over 1000GBP) we took a taxi from the hotel to the airport. On the way the driver took a call on his mobile and handed the phone to me. It was a girl in reception telling me (quite wrongly in fact) that I had failed to pay for a beer at the pool area and what was I going to do about it. I was speechless. In 10 years as Travel Editor of a UK National newspaper I have never been treated in such a humiliating fashion. This crass incident soured an otherwise enjoyable trip and I shall never go back to the hotel. Try the charming Riad Kniza near the Bab Doukala instead.

There are several restaurants and bar.    The reception desk was under manned and one always had to wait but the staff were friendly. Breakfast was mediocre and room service menu was very limited.    I had a suite overlooking the pool which was very roomy with a bathroom with bath and shower - the shower was blocked and despite having asked three times for it to be unblocked it never was so I showered in the bath. The second bathroom had a basin and WC.    This hotel is not 5 star by any means due to lack of attention to detail - more like a three star but i did enjoy my stay there.

The rooms are beautiful the hotel has three swimming pools and many other break out / chill out rooms all gorgeously decorated. The feel is very much of a large riad than a 5* hotel. The location is fantastic literally a 5 min walk from the Souks and the main square.    I found the breakfast a bit limiting and felt there could have been more choice. The attitude of some staff members was a bit hostile (e.g. lady who made the eggs in the morning!).    Some members of our group experienced a sewer smell in their room at certain times of the day and no running water which was not pleasant to say the least. However I made a complaint to the manager and we were compensated with a free spa treatment and entry to the spa pool (access to the pool I think should be free to guests anyway) - which I have to say was AMAZING.    One small point I was disappointed that the manager did not bother speaking to me in person - which is important for customer service.    On a final note my sister enjoyed her 40th birthday and the hotel did organise for a gorgeous surprise cake - which was lovely and generous.,Date of stay: April 2011,Trip type: Traveled with friends,United Kingdom,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChanderK37

The negative experiences with hotel staff however will ensure that we never return. In general we found that the staff were unfriendly and appeared ticked off if we asked for something (a spoon at breakfast information about a taxi). One experience with the concierge was very negative - he gave us a price for stamps and when we brought it to his attention that he had not given us enough change ranted about how we could go out to the square to get stamps if we wanted. He pulled out a calculator to show us the cost...the result of his calculations verified our position that he had not given us enough change. He yelled something in Arabic and left the room. Yikes! The front desk staff were less-than-helpful on other occasions also making us wait for them to finish laughing at a joke or wait while they looked at something on their cell phone. Very unprofessional. I do not recommend this hotel. For the service that you get it is way overpriced.",Date of stay: April 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,HI,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelsforfunHi

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,louisehertfordshire wrote a review Apr 2011,30,Housekeeping needs improvement!,The hotel has a wonderful central position and feels an oasis of calm after the madness of Marrakesh. The lobby chairs are old and tired. Our VIP(?) garden room had a chair with a stain on the side the soles of my feet were black from walking on the tiles without shoes and the room needed a thorough clean! I spilt face-powder on to a window seat and when I tried to remove this with a damp towel - the towel was black!! Breakfast selection could also be improved and often the burners under the food were not switched on and tomatoes/potatoes were cold.    Staff in the Piano Bar were very pleasant. The saving grace was the superb staff on Reception. I think we will book a good Riad next time round.,Date of stay: March 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Cambridge, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/louisehertfordshire

An oasis to return to after activities elsewher in the city or surrounding area. Get a balcony room its worth a little extra. Drinks are a little expensive food in its 4 (?) restaurants is generally good. Nice rooftop pool with view of the Koutoubia Mosque about 2-300 metres away. Spa is also good and a little cheaper than many equivalent European spas.  10-15 minute transfer to/from the airport. Usual warnings about souks apply.

It is dark dowdy and rundown. In the absence of a refurbishing it needs aggressive and detail oriented housekeeping. The latter would include a scrub brush (vs. a mop) a paintbrush and a serious effort to regrout and replaster replace poolside turfre plant flowers and planter boxes every six weeks ect. Management should also find a new and trendier lobby shop keeper upgrade appearance of front entrance better staff uniforms and work to have neighboring cheesy souvenir stalls and hawkers replaced and or upgraded. Sound proof as there's a VERY loud mosque nearby. I suggest that the manager start by redecorating the lobby. It's very dated!!!

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,CanadianinBatonRouge wrote a review Feb 2011,40,"Very good location, nice pools.",I enjoyed my stay at this hotel overall a great experience and I would visit it again. First the location is ideal as you are a 100m walk from the main square. That was good as after a few hours of looking around the area you could head back to your hotel for a rest.    The hotel has three pools one in the main courtyard another on the roof and a third in the Spa. The courtyard is a great place to hang out and enjoy a drink. The rooftop pool has a nice large deck with lounges around it and in February it was heated as well. There is a bar at the top near the pool. The third pool at the Spa is used by those at the Spa. Several friends use the spa services for massages and such and raved about it.    The rooms vary in size some of us had a single room and others had small suites. My only complaint about the stay was that my room was very warm. During the day I had to leave the window open as the air conditioning system was not working - at least that I could tell.    The staff was pretty good although I found sometimes that the staff at the front desk was rather brusque. Staff in the Piano Bar and the restaurant were much nicer.,Date of stay: February 2011,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"San Marcos, Texas",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CanadianinBatonRouge

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,tonyj01 wrote a review Dec 2010,40,"Not a true 5 star, but better than other reviewers suggest",Stayed in this hotel late November 2010 with my wife for a three night break.    Position of hotel is great only 1-2 minutes walk from the Jeema-el-Fna Square. This means it is almost in the souk area. Many other luxury hotels in Marrakech might be 20 mins walk or a taxi from this true central area.    Like another reviewer I had no response by email from the hotel to requests. When I phoned them before arriving they expressed surprise that emails hadn't been dealt with but . . .    I have no connection with the hotel and have no need to apologise for it. Carpets were not filthy. It seems to be a Berber luxury style to have red long pile carpets. Public areas were attractive the central pool was cool and reflecting there was a log fire lit in the central courtyard every evening. The ground floor bar with piano player was relaxing too.    Reception staff could be more friendly we nearly complained when one seemed to be chatting to a friend rather than dealing with us. However they helped us with many other things advice booking restaurants and taxis. There was mineral water supplied and the free wifi worked well faster on off peak times it was slower around breakfast time and early evening.    Spa and indoor pool are beautiful many rooms built around the various pools. Several restaurants. Breakfast was not to a European 5 star standard more like an Italian 4 star - scrambled eggs ready although they had a chef making eggs to order and another chef making crepes to order at breakfast. There was a shortage to teaspoons at breakfast but we laughed about it and carried on.    To compare with other comments in November cooler month there were towels by the pools plentiful supply the hotel was full and the pool area was kept clean and tidy.    The rooftop Asian style restaurant was good we enjoyed lunch there and rested around the rooftop pool.,Date of stay: November 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Manchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tonyj01

We booked a suite which was v modern and in good order so we did not experience any of the problems suffered by others below. Marrakech old town filthy and seedy I'm afraid . Some people may call it' full of character' but I take no pleasure in viewing squalor and poverty.  Enjoyed mint tea in cafes overlooking the square but cringed at tourists being hassled and intimidated below. Awful experinece one night (2am) when call girl knocked on our room demanding to be let in (we were two women staying alone). Called security and instead of promptly escorting her off the premises made us feel as if we were in the wrong for complaining. Food in hotel fine  except for instance where food fell on the floor and they simply plonked in back on our plates. Yes and the red shag pile rugs do look like they need a good clean.

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,Travel Richly wrote a review Oct 2010,20,Nice location and not much else,Nice looking hotel perfectly located in the old medina. Unfortunately almost nothing in our rooms (was traveling with friends) worked as it should. The list includes: non-existent water pressure in the shower; air-conditioning that never brought the room temperature below 75 degrees (23 C); electricity that would go off at any time of the day or night; and internet service (free) whose reception was spotty at best.    Other annoying things: smelling cigarette smoke coming through our room vent from nearby rooms; charging for bottled water (tap water is not drinkable); TV cable going off and on; front desk forgetting our wake-up calls; having to wait forever to get coffee and other hot drinks at breakfast.

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,JohnwWestgate wrote a review Oct 2010,50,Our opinion of Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,We have just returned from a 4 night stay at this hotel and can only say what a lovely time we had. The hotel is absolutely excellent and deserves 5 stars in most things. I will say though that it was perhaps expensive for 4 nights on a bed and breakfast basis. Also our room was directly over the bar which in itself was not noisy but you could clearly hear everyone sitting outside. These are only our opinions and not necessarily great problems but they are worth knowing about before you go. However the actual hotel is lovely and its position in Marrakech is superb. Just a short walk from the front door and you are right in the middle of everything going on in Marrakech (and there is usually lots going on). The staff in the hotel could not do enough for us while we were there and the hotel was spotless. Our room was kept lovely at all times. I can only say that if you are thinking of going there you will not be sorry we certainly were not.,Date of stay: October 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Westgate-on-sea, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnwWestgate

Located next to the Souk this hotel offers a unique Arabian atmosphere both charming and luxurious. The hotel itself is not 100 % perfect but this is what creates the effect of beeing part of ""Arabian Nights"". We visited several other fantastic hotels during our stay (Mamonia etc) but always felt more at home in our own Koutoubia palace! The Spa is fantastic the pool area is fantastic (both roof pool and courtyard pool) and the restaruants are very good. Breakfast is a feast although they could improve their service during breakfast. We often had to order our coffee two or three times and tell them to replenish the fruit salad clean the tables etc. If this doesn't bother you this hotel will offer you everything you would wish for during your stay.    We are definately going back for more!!    PS. If you can afford it I would highly recommend a night in the suites on top of the hotel.

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,ChorleyLichfield wrote a review Oct 2010,20,Looks great but staff are inept and 40% mark-up on exchange rate since they want to bill in Dirham.,"Stayed 5 nights. Although we had booked on-line and sent email & 'phoned (because no reply to email) to arrange collection from airport they were still surprised when we arrived. No one had a clue what to do. Eventually we changed and went for a walk. When we can back 3 hours later they had still not sorted a room.  Breakfast should be recorded on You-Tube. It took 4 requests to 4 different member of staff to get a tea-spoon. Each member of staff appears to have their own specific duty therefore unless that is part of their ""responsibility"" they are not interested. Breakfast items are eventually replenished when a mass of guest have gathered around the self service area waiting for food.  The concierge service is a complete waste of time. They are unhelp and not interested.  The final straw was the bill. Although we had booked on-line with a price quoted in Euros the hotel insisted on converting this to Dirham @ 40% above any available exchange rate. We asked to pay in euro but they refused...wonder why.  The return trip to the airport which we thought had been booked with the hotel had not been booked....therefore after much discussion & frustration we caught a taxi outside the hotel. Fortunately we had allowed sufficient time to make our flight.  In conclusion great location wonderful looking riad but awful service and complete lack of management.

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,JohnRich52 wrote a review Oct 2010,20,Poor management ruins potentially good hotel,Stayed with my wife Thursday to Monday probably about the right amount of time to spend in Marrakech IMHO.    The hotel could be very good the location is excellent quality of building the.facilities and the rooms all undoubted 5* .    However the staff training and their managemernt is an inept shambles. Staff amble about without direction avoid eye contact and fail to deliver a service above 3*. I simply don't understand the generous praise of the staff elsewhere on this site. I paid around $500 per night and I am used to hotels at that level around the world I have had better service from better trained staff everywhere except New York!    The food varied from a good buffet breakfast a very poor lunch/snack/pool restaurant which delivered the worst Club Sandwich I have ever seen. Appalling and the Caesar's salad was only marginally better. The Moroccan restaurant was only adaquate; meat and vegetables served in a tangine but of a standard which might pass muster in a B&B in Margate but is not impressive in this location or at this price.The other two restaurants in the hotel were considerably better. the Relais de Paris (fish and grilled meats) was a nice meal and the Asian Restaurant combined good food with the only good restaurant manager and unsurprisingly therefore by far the best standard of service we encountered during our stay.    There are 3 main pools 1 exclusively for spa clients the others roof top and in the main coutyard area. All are quality facilities but again no managed presence of staff means no towels (plenty used none clean!) no clearing away of glasses etc. Very uninviting despite great potential.    With the right management this hotel could be turned around in a few weeks until that happens I wouldn't recommend it to anyone as a 5* destination.,Date of stay: September 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnRich52

I travelled with three female friends and as this was our first trip to morrocco we were slightly apprehensive. That is until we stepped into this dream of a hotel. Staff were extremely courteous and helpful. Our rooms were immediately upgraded when they heard that I was celebrating my 50th birthday. The hotel has two beautiful pools and plenty of staff around to bring cool drinks when required. We dined in the relais de paris restaurant and the indian restaurant both within the hotel complex and the food was delicious and not over priced. The hotel has a clarins Hammam and spa where my friend enjoyed a lovely hot oil massage.  The hotel is situated just beside the medina and jma el fna square which is busy but lots of fun. The vendors are friendly and were never intimidating but they do like a good chat!! Always barter for goods it is expected. If you get lost in the market there is always a friendly local who will guide you back to the square....for a few dirhams of course!  When the heat and the noise became a bit overwhelming we were only a short walk from our lovely hotel haven.  We had a look at the other 5 star hotels in the new medina (gueliz) but the area appeared a bit lacking in character and we were so glad we stayed in the colourful and busy old medina area.  If you are looking for a hotel in the morroccan style full of colour warmth and charm we could not recommend this hotel more highly.

The manic hustle and bustle of the streets outside and then the peace and quiet and cleanliness of all areas of the hotel were so welcoming. We were very fortunate to be upgraded to a suite and it was so big had separte lounge 2 plasma TVs and a massive marble bathroom.  Regardless of the room luxury the hotel pool are was so relaxing and calm with luxurious sunbeds and plams everywhere.  We chose not to eat dinner in the hotel restaurants even though they looked stunning were very expensive and we actually wanted to sample the cuisine of the square.  Watch your bags say no and mean it and dont touch anything your not interested in buying!

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,Eudoxxia wrote a review Aug 2010,50,Marrakechi Lifesaver!,After travelling across southern Morocco for a number of weeks I was in need of a base in Marrakech that combined the traditional with modern creature comforts. Fortunately for me I secured a reservation at the Jardins de la Koutoubia for a week at the end of July - a very hot time to be in Marrakech!    Staying here was a real lifesaver. The location is incredible - you are right beside the Place Jemnaa el Fnaa the medina and the Koutoubia mosque but the hotel is a tranquil oasis in the heart of a very bustling city. I couldn't believe how quiet both the hotel and rooms were and appreciated being able to walk anywhere in the medina from the hotel. My room was a beautiful mini suite with a private balcony that overlooked the gardens and the Koutoubia mosque; so I could hear the beautiful call to prayer - so comforting and soothing. The room was large with lots of storage and a safe and the bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was gorgeous with a seperate rain shower and big soaker tub and no shortage of hot water or issues with water pressure. The plasma tv had a good variety of stations and there was room in the mini bar to keep extra bottles of water.    One thing I really must comment on is how well trained the staff at this hotel are. Multilingual helpful and very polite the staff were all wonderful and made me (a solo female traveller) feel very welcome and safe. I tried some of the restaurants (there are five!) and found the food to be excellent and not bad overcooked hotel food. Their room service is also excellent and welcome when you need a quiet meal. Considering this is a five star luxury hotel the prices for food and drink were really reasonable and good quality. The same is true for the spa which I made good use of. While this was not the best hamman I have ever had all the services were excellent and not overpriced. And the pools - especially the large one in the courtyard of the main building - were a welcome escape from the afternoon heat of Marrakech. The free internet workstations - on Macs no less! - were also welcome and it was nice not to be charged for this service as many other high-end hotels tend to do. I think there may have also been wifi in the hotel but did not access it to find out.    If I had one criticism of this hotel - and I really have to search to find one - it would be that there were some problems with their telephone service. The phones crashed a few times and calls/messages were not forwarded. A minor frustration but annoying. They might also consider getting rid of the shag carpeting in the lobby as this hotel is certainly not stuck in the 1970's but the bad shag gives off a dated impression which does the hotel a disservice.    Other than that this hotel is a gem and I can't recommend it highly enough. I loved the mix of traditional architecture and hospitality with the modern conveniences location and the incredible staff. If you can stay at the Jardins de la Koutoubia! I look forward to returning in the future as this hotel puts many of the other high-end Marrakechi hotels to shame.,Date of stay: July 2010,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Ottawa, Ontario, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Eudoxxia

On the minus side: the minibars were lukewarm and didn't really keep anything cold the toilet required three or four flushes before everything disappeared the airconditioning did its best in extremely hot weather but didn't get the temperature down very much.

The room housekeeping seemed hit and miss at times.    We appreicated breakfast running until 10.30.  Also the wireless access  The hotel was in the perfect place in Marrakech.  I loved how when you stepped into the hotel from outside it was just so other worldly.

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,guyvangent wrote a review Jun 2010,40,silent paradise in the midle of the old town,Very nice hotel a big riad (+/- 80 rooms) with nice garden and swimmingpool. Nice furnitured with old Moroccan stuff. Not more than 300 meters from Jamaa El Fna.  Only the bathroom and (sometimes) the service could be better.  Food was correct. One of the restaurants is at the roof-top.  They have a fantastic spa-center in the cellars.  When you step outside the hotel; you are directly in the middle of the Moroccan life and the souks in the middle of the old town between the Toukoubia Mosque and the Jamaa El Fna square.

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,northstar_jojo wrote a review May 2010,30,Pretty good hotel inside the Medina,Overall the hotel is pretty good with attentive staff and above-average service. Rooms are clean and of a decent size; the restaurants inside the hotel are all pretty great as well. One important thing before deciding to stay at this hotel: it is located in a rather messy corner within the Medina which is the old part of town. It can be quite a hassle to get to the hotel...the taxi could only get you so far into the Medina and then you have to walk the rest of the way. I would recommend this hotel to people who are more adventurous and interested in exploring the Medina on foot.,Date of stay: March 2008,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Taipei, Taiwan",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/northstar_jojo
Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,Natalie P wrote a review Apr 2010,50,heaven in the middle of the medina,The hotel was just fantastic from start to finish. Greated by friendly staff given mint tea to unwind while they did the check in and swiftly got a room upgrade. The room was large and overlooked the pool.    The most striking thing was the tranquility of the hotel when it was so close to the madness of the main square - the only noise was from the birds singing in the courtyard and the call to prayer from the Koutoubia mosque.    The location was fantastic - literally a 2 min walk to Jamar El Fnar down a road which we felt safe on even at night as 2 women alone. The landmark of the Koutoubia mosque means that even with very limited French it is easy to get back to the hotel in a taxi.    The staff were friendly and helpful; the rooftop pool was like paradise... Lunches were great in the hotel. The Clarins spa was reasonably priced and the treatments were fantastic. In fact the only problem was trying to find reasons to leave the hotel - even all the best restuarants in the area seemed to be in the hotel according to the guides!  in short i couldn't recommend it more!,Date of stay: April 2010,Trip type: Traveled with friends,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nataliepE1744OZ

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,anon1612 wrote a review Apr 2010,30,Not great,We were excited about going to Jardins de la Koutoubia as photos on the website look amazing and it is a 5 star hotel. However we feel it once may have been a 5 star but is v dated today with poor levels of service making it at the very most a 3/4 star. It has a fabulous pool and amazing spa (Clarins spa) but that's about it. You arrive into the lobby and it feels like you are back in the 70s. No great welcome from the staff at the front desk (in fact one girl was permanently on the phone and would answer your questions with the phone hanging on her shoulder....5 star hotels dont try and multi task!). The food at the poolside snack bar (downstairs) was terrible and the service v poor. The service at the restaurant at the top of the hotel should be used as an example...the lady who is front of house is amazing. So charming and welcoming...but she needs to teach the rest of the hotel her tricks! We had to ask for our room to be cleaned a couple of times...they don't do turn down service in the evening (again is this really a 5 star hotel?) and we had to ask for the cleaning staff to be quieter in the morning. Our room (don't get 220) was right next to all the cleaning cuphoards...so it was fairly chaotic early in the morning. No sleep ins! Next time we go to Marrakech we will opt for a smaller classier hotel at probably much better value.,Date of stay: March 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anon1612

Upgraded from a mini suite to a junior suite which was still a very average room size. Don't let the ""suites"" fool you. Made us wonder how regular rooms look like. Cleanliness of the rooms was below everage and all linnen was quite worn out. Service is generally friendly and speaks fluent French and English.  Bfast again is average and not up to int´l 5star standards. Note that the hotel has a main building and 2 separate but connected other buildings. We stayed in one of the latter.  The main garden is definately an asset. Also the garden next to the 2 other buildings are okay. The main pool can be chilly. With ths hotel as a base you can see Marrakech by foot.

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,littlebreak wrote a review Mar 2010,50,Wonderfully relaxing hotel with very friendly staff & super restaurants in a great location!,We were upgraded to a suite which had rose petals scattered everywhere! The views from the room were lovely. It is located a minute's walk from the main Square and despite the rather busy bustling road that leads one to the hotel once inside you enter a peaceful and relaxing sanctuary. It has a traditional charm and you truly feel as though you are in Morocco unlike some other 5* hotels which could be based anywhere. The staff are very friendly and nothing is too much trouble for them. The restaurants especially the French restaurant at the hotel were very good. Enough to keep us from eating elsewhere! Room service was very quick and the room was always spotless. We were initially concerned that being a stone's throw away from the Koutoubia & Square we might be disturbed by the noise...but it was the complete opposite and we found it to be very peaceful. Yes there is the Call to Prayer several times a day - but one is in Marrakech it is to be expected! The hotel is walking distance away from the main tourist sites. The Clarins Spa at the hotel is fabulous and the therapists ensure that you are their No.1 client and pamper you incredibly well! The hotel staff will happily arrange transportation and tours if needed.

We loved everything about the hotel. Our room was lovely overlooking the swimming pool the food excellent and the staff were very friendly.    The hotel is a world away from the streets outside. When you are in the main square with the beggars snake charmers belly dancers and countless people offering their services as a guide you step through the door of the hotel to find a peaceful relaxing haven. It was great to experience 2 different worlds. One minute haggling with the people in the Souks the next sun bathing by the swimming pool.    We didnt take a chance and eat outside of the hotel but there are 4 restaurants to choose from with plenty of choice. The Indian/ Asian restaurant was my favorite. The other comment i will make is that i thought that everything in the hotel wasnt expensive. The drinks(with the exception of champagne) was much cheaper than the UK. In fact we struggled to spend money this trip! Happy days!    This hotel is a must. The location is superb and we loved it.

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,treezlondon wrote a review Aug 2009,50,Beautiful haven,Having read some of the reviews on this site I was more than a little apprehensive. Will the Muezzin wake us up? Will it be grubby? Will it be pricey? (Who writes these things?) Certainly I had no need to be. From the moment we arrived we were treated like visiting dignitaries. The staff could not do enough for us and I feel some of our own hotel staff could learn a thing or two from the friendly helpful staff at the Koutoubia.    The hotel was immaculately clean and well-cared for - it seemed the staff spent their whole day cleaning. I tried to find fault with the place (because we all do) and the best I could do was the doors into the bathroom were a bit awkward and the handles on the wardrobes were a bit heavy and therefore noisy.    That was all !    Apart from that it was a great place to stay in the midst of all the noise and heat of Marrakech it was alittle oasis of calm.    i want everyone to go there. I loved it. Go there.

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,YvetteLondon wrote a review May 2009,30,Not truly a Five Star hotel,On the plus side this hotel is well situted for the many souks the gardens and palace. However in the evening the main entrance of the hotel is surrounded by touts and the taxis mopeds and donkey carts present a bit of a challenge.    On the plus side the room we were offered looked and felt authentically Moroccan. However it was not particularly clean - there were food crumbs and a used tissue in the bathroom pee stains on the toilet floor which was not washed during our stay the curtains were grubby and had stains of dubious origin the bedding smelled as though it had been riding on the donkey outside and the blanket on my bed had a cigarette burn in it.    On the plus side the hotel benefits from three lovely swimming pools - one at garden level one on the roof and one in the indoor spa. However the garden level pool is ice cold and if you do decide to swim you'll be lucky to find a member of staff to provide you with towels. I made two attempts before eventually going to the main reception desk and asking them for help.    Breakfast was more of a 'continental' affair than anything else but you could get baked beans lentils stewed chicken chicken cocktail sausages and fried eggs if that's your bag. Be prepared though to share your breakfast with some of the non-paying guests. The birds are fearless. They are on a flight path from the dining room to the breakfast tables on the terrace and will race in and out feeding from the baskets of bread and pastries uninterrupted by the inattentive catering staff.    On the plus side there are 3/2 restaurants to choose from in the hotel and food can be ordered and eaten on the garden terrace. I would recommend the Asian-style restaurant on the roof terrace which has an extensive menu and provides fine quality food at a very reasonable price (roughly 400 Dh for 2 starters 2 main courses 2 soft Drinks and coffee). However the Moroccan-style restaurant for which you have to pre-book came in way below expectations. I ordered the beef chicken and lamb brochette combo (which were actually the size of ice lolly sticks) and were only luke warm - served with a scoop of green coloured rice. My friend ordered the chicken tagine which was one emaciated limb flanked by five green olives. For this a serving of sliced orange three cold scotch pancakes (described as Moroccan-style) smeared with chocolate spread not chocolate sauce and missing its cinnamon a bottle of red wine and a bottle of mineral water we paid ......... more than we should have.    The hotel spa provides a welcome retreat with a good selection of treatments. Not all of the staff speak English so you may want to read up on what your treatment entails and avoid any surprises. If things get a bit hot for you no one will notice and you won't be offered water. But if you ask you'll be given a 500ml bottle - no glass nor straw - however it will at least be chilled .    I hope that the foregoing will provide you with a helpful insight to the hotel and won't discourage you from trying it out. There are many features and settings which you have to experience for yourself and the coutryard and pool areas are particularly beautiful at night.,Date of stay: May 2009,Trip type: Traveled with friends,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YvetteLondon
Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,Aranwen wrote a review Apr 2009,40,An oasis amidst the melee,"Stayed here for 4 nights with our teenage son. The hotel is in a perfect location for the square jamaa el Fna and the souks. It has about 3 or 4 restaurants which are good but a little overpriced. The Indian restaurant is good for lunch but very disappointing in the evening. Best to follow the adage ""When in Rome....""  There are 2 pools which are well tended and clean but it can get very competitive for sun loungers as many guests stay by the pool all day every day. Also in the afternoon one side of the pool is in shade so places on the sunny side are at a premium.  The rooms are clean and nicely furnished. we were upgarded to a mini suite which was fine but didn't have a very nice view. Also there was a cockerel somewhere making a terrible racket for most of the day and early morning. I think we could have easily wrung its neck!! Also the hotel is very close to koutoubia mosque so you get the call to prayer very early in the morning.  Breakfast is continental though you can have eggs pancakes etc if you pay a little extra. It is more than adequate and the service is excellent.  As you can't take dinars into or out of the country we changed our dollars and euros at the main desk. Also there are quite a few ATMs just off the square.  As mentioned the square is is a short walk from the hotel. you have to negotiate beggars and numerous mopeds and motor bikes en route. Petrol fumes are pretty choking in the souks and some drive at great speed. It means you have to be aware of them all the time. Crossing the road is a bit of a nightmare as pedestrian crossings seem to be a complete waste of time so just run!!!

This hotel gave us all we wanted just 3 hours flight away from London and only 15 minutes taxi ride from the airport right in the middle of ""the action"".  We were at first disappointed with the somewhat shambolic aspect of the city but then the puzzle gets solved and the combination of light colour of buildings ( ocre everywhere ) snow capped Atlas mountain in the background and the superbe location of the hotel ( right in the middle of it yet feeling like a retreat ). You get woken up by the calls for prayers so have to be a good sleeper but for the rest this is as exotic as one can dream of. The bedroom ( suite ) was large with a separate room for our 4yrs old son the staff was friendly - altough a bit amateur-ish but this is really the only thing I would point out  the 3 restaurants offer you plenty of food choice and we were fans of the Asian restaurant on the rooftop by the heated pool - the hotel has 3 swimming pools but during winter only the rooftop one is actually used but this was not problem as scenery is amazing and it never felt overcrowded despite mid term week a few kids were playing from time to time so the pool could be a bit noisy but they had separated area on the roof as well as a very quiet main pool. The building is superbe quite large hotel but it felts like a boutique hotel at all time tks to small-ish common area.  The Spa is again large yet plenty of small rooms and great atmosphere in the hotel basement with heated pool etc...  So strongly recommend the place for a short break spending one full week there might be too long tough unles you are into carpets moroccan art etc and want to spend your time shopping for new furnitures...

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,Phototravelgirl wrote a review Jan 2009,20,Overpriced and not 5-star quality,My husband and I booked 3 nights at the Jardins Koutoubia in Marrakech as a romantic weekend getaway. We opted for the wellness package which included a hamman and massage daily breakfast free airport transfer (though we tipped) and a complimentary room category upgrade. We booked the patio suite and expected to be upgraded to a mini suite. When we arrived at the airport the hotel shuttle was waiting for us with a sign right on schedule. The ride to the hotel only took about 10 minutes and they swiftly took our luggage inside the lobby while we checked in and they served moroccan pastries and mint tea. The hotel is very close to the Medina which is good for sight seeing but bad because it is next to Koutoubia mosque and you will hear the call to prayer early in the mornings and until sunset though my husband thought it gave a real cultural experience to the trip. The room they gave us the supposed mini suite was too small for our expectations we could hear the noise from the inner courtyard from people enjoying the outdoor fireplace and found ourselves confined to two single beds for our romantic break. My husband complained to reception and they moved us the 2nd night to a junior suite which had a lovely canopy bed and more importantly a single double bed! The staff was lovely and really did make an effort but there was always something short of perfect at the hotel to include no hot water on our 2nd day the water actually was running brown yuck! They did fix it in less than a day though. There is no clock or alarm clock in the room so we scheduled a wake up call to find out the phone in our bedroom did not ring and they never managed to fix it so we had to use the alarm on our mobile phone. The food in the onsite Moroccan restaurant is very good an excellent value compared to the tourist trap restaurants that await you outside. Overall we felt Marrakech was overpriced for what you get in the end and the hotel is not at 5-star level though they charge ritz carlton prices. If you can find a good price at the hotel and specify exactly what room you want then it might be okay. The Clarins spa was very nice the indoor pool is very relaxing and the treatments are top notch.    Positives  - Close to Medina where you can pick up a sightseeing bus and local goods and food. The spice shops have nice selections.  - Onsite spa rootop heated pool and good restaurants    Negatives  - Small rooms and not well maintained (mould on the bathtub cracks on the walls phone does not ring no hot water for one day)  - Service was friendly but very slow  - Noise from the Koutoubia mosque at the crack of dawn,Date of stay: January 2009,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Charlotte, North Carolina",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Phototravelgirl

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,ChickenHawk wrote a review Dec 2008,40,"200 yards from the Main Square, peaceful, great pools",The hotel is located 200 yards from the Jema' al-fna - the main square in the Medina. From the main square you will explore the Souks (shops selling antiques leather and tat). Perfect hotel location when you just want to flee the pestering merchants.    Hotel has 3 pools (one heated on roof one main outdoor and one indoor pool & spa). The main outdoor pool is freezing in the winter the rooftop pool is heated but few guests ventured in and the indoor is warm. The seating areas around the pools are lovely.    Breakfast is good but little variety from day to day.    Staff are excellent - friendly and helpful. Tipping in cash is greatly appreciated 10-20 dirhams. They were flexible with late check-out.    The quoted rate calling the property directly does not include 10% tax.    The room we had was in the newly constructed wing of the hotel with its own private garden. Although it's a bit of a maze to find the rooms I think they were better because most had balconies or patios (if on the ground floor). The rooms overlooking the main pool in the old hotel don't seem to have balconies large enough to sit out on. Medina facing rooms might be a bit noisy but we didn't stay in one.    Overall this is an excellent hotel with a full service offering and superb location. My main complaint was making the reservation. E-mails to the hotel and spa were either ignored or just very slow - one expects immediate responses in this day and age. I gave up and called directly.,Date of stay: December 2008,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChickenHawk

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,TheKazguide wrote a review Nov 2008,50,"Oasis of calm, great hotel returning in Dec 08",Fantastic hotel quiet oasis just one minute from the main square and souks. We had four wonderful days in January 08 we were a group of 7 and had four spacious rooms with balcony overlooking the beautiful majestic central pool and garden. Some of us are returning in December 08 as the hotel is so nice and relaxing. In January the weather was warm great to swim in the heated pool on the roof terrace and chill out in the sun on the big sun beds. All the restaurants in the hotel have good food we had lunch on the rooftop terrace and under the trees in the garden and one night in the Indian restaurant on the roof. Good buffet breakfast with hot and cold selection. Friendly staff who speak quite good English try a little French if you can. The spa is a relaxing haven stunning pool and we tried lots of different spa treatments.    Roses and rose petals all around the hotel and in the room give a wonderful perfume. Try relaxing with an evening drink in the lounges with open fires around the pool then go to the main square to see the hustle and bustle of the evening stalls.    Take the open top bus to see the sights and gardens around town and try out the restaurant run by women called Al Faisir the hotel can book a table as it is very popular. We had a fantastic stay and can't wait to come back to the hotel in December 08 for another relaxing time.,Date of stay: January 2008,Trip type: Traveled with friends,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheKazguide
Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,dfeins wrote a review Oct 2008,50,AMAZING Hotel,This is THE best place to stay in the center of Marrakesh hands-down. The photos on the website don't even do it justice. The rooms were modern with a Moroccan touch and had all the necessary amenities including bathrobes blow dryer etc. From the moment my boyfriend and I walked in and smelled the fragrant jasmine in the lobby we were in heaven. They upgraded our room on the 2nd of our 3 nights without us even asking. The pool is amazing. The spa one of the most gorgeous I have ever seen. Very convenient and tasty food options. Extremely helpful staff and concierge. 24-hour free internet in the business center. This hotel is literally 1 minute off the main Djemna square where you will find snake charmers musicians etc. If you want to be in the middle of it all but still feel like you're on luxury vacation stay here!!,Date of stay: October 2008,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"New York, NY",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dfeins
Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,chirpybirdy wrote a review Oct 2008,50,Fantastic holiday,Marrakech is the most amazing mad place I have ever been to. Spent 5 days there with my husband celebrating our 10th Wedding Anniversary. Absolutely fell in love with the place. It was Ramadan and we had no problems getting food and drink although we felt it was courteous to be discreet. Les Jardins was a great choice of hotel. Perfectly located for the hustle and bustle of the square souks and surrounding sites but an absolute haven of calm as soon as you walk through the doors. It is not located on a dead end street as a previous reviewer says but on a small side street heading directly to the square.    The hotel is airy spacious and wonderfully decorated. The pool area is peaceful and relaxing whether sunbathing during the heat of the day or enjoying a pre or after dinner drink in the evening. Breakfast is lovely with a buffet of continental english cooked and more traditional dishes. Make sure you sit outside to enjoy the morning birdsong. We got a free upgrade to a mini suite with a view of the annexe garden area and the Koutoubia Minaret. Great room especially when decorated with rose petals by the maid each morning.

When you arrive the road outside that you trundle down with your cases is a bit crazy but then as soon as you walk through the big hotel doors always being greeted by the friendly staff it's like walking into another world. The hotel is beautiful! It's nice and quiet you can easily forget the hustle and bustle of the city! All of the staff are all very friendly and all speak good english which is great if you can't speak french. The rooms are lovely very clean morracan style rooms. If you can then try and get a room that over looks the pool. The pool area is beautiful woith lots of morracan features big flowing curtains open fire places! The cocktail bar make a great moijito!!

Got free upgrade on arrival (because it was my birthday although I didn’t specifically mention this) to a mini suite room overlooking pool area with complimentary fruit water and pastries. Very quiet (except for announcements from Koutoubia mosque around 4am!). Room split into 2 with a flat screen TV in each. Bathroom small but had everything we needed. Main pool and rooftop pool both cold but very welcome in 105 degrees (September) and surrounding loungers very comfortable. Great Clarins spa - around £30 - £40 for 50 min massage. No complaints about restaurants (food good - average between £35 - £40 for 2 with a bottle of wine). Lounge areas nicely decorated and very comfortable. From our experience staff were very friendly and polite even with our minimal French.    Perfect location for the main square and souks and other main sites within walking distance - just watch the traffic which comes from any direction!    Overall we thought the hotel was a good 4*.

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,youngUk wrote a review Aug 2008,40,Lovely Hotel- An Oasis in the heart of Marrakesh-Great Location!,We stayed at the Jardins for three nights. Location wise you cannot get a better deal. Its about 1 minute's walk for the square that gets extremely noisy yet you walk into the jadins and leave all the husle and bustle of the streets behind you. We stayed in on of the central facing rooms facing the pool.    What we liked best about this hotel is that although poolside was busy guests were very curteous towards each other in terms of noise levels. In fact im pretty sure you could hear a pin drop in the middle of the hot days!    Staff were helpful yet it took four attempts to try and get a double bed (not just two singles lying side by side!). Eventually someone came up while we were gone and simply put a sheet over the two matresses so it seemed like a double! We gave in the end and just accepted the situation!    Other than that nothing bad about the hotel at all. Lovely quiet little haven in the centre of a busy city such as Marrakesh.,Date of stay: August 2008,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,uk,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/youngUk
Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,VeVaParis wrote a review Aug 2008,40,An oasis of calm in Marrakech,We just came back from Morroco where we stayed for 5 nights at Les Jardins de la Koutoubia.  The location is excellent just a few steps from the Jemaa el Fnaa Place and the souks. You can however escape at any time from the noise and crowd in the hotel patio and just relax near one of the beautiful swimming pools.  The restaurants are nice the roof restaurant especially is delightful if a little expensive.  The rooms are very nice and big enough. The only thing we can complain about is that the medina rooms are very noisy as the windows are not holding up the noise.  So book a patio bedroom if you want to have a quiet night.  However the hotel did upgrade us for the same price in a patio room so that our stay was just perfect!  I cannot confirm any of the bad reviews on the service and certainly not on any coakroaches! The service is fine: Of course it's better to speak French but this is Morroco.

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,VixenEdinburgh wrote a review Aug 2008,30,Mixed Bag,We stayed in the hotel for 10 nights in July this year and some good and some bad experiences.    The good things... the staff were lovely we found them to be very helpful and attentive. The location is very central for the square the souks and visting the major sights. The pool (main one in the courtyard) is just lovely and a very relaxing place to lounge. The asian restraunt on the roof is fabulous.    The downsides... well for me there was one very big downside and that was the fact the hotel is obviously infested with cockroaches. We were first of all in a patio room which had door opening out onto the gardens and it was a lovely room on initial inspection in fact not sure it wasn't a suite as there was a large seating are in addition to the bedroom area... anyway at 3am on the first night I woke up with a cockroach crawling on my face!!!    To say I wasn't happy is an understatement in fact we packed then and there to leave the hotel. The next morning when we tried to check out the girl on reception called the manager after I explained why I wanted to do so.. they offered us a second floor room in the new annex of the hotel and some free spa treatments in the clarins spa. Unsure at first we asked to see the room which was a junior suite with lovely decor and very large marble bathroom. We agreed to stay after seeing it and being reassured there were absolutely no roaches in this part of the hotel. BUT they did say its a common issue in the garden rooms and they had to do onoing treatments .. and whilst we were in the new room but passing through the old part of the hotel we did see a number of dead roaches in the corridors.    So that a pretty big downside but for me the only other issue was that the new part of the hotel is quite a walk away from reception up and down over two floors and through the gardens or down a not too well lit alleyway.    I have rated the hotel neutral despite this issue as they would have got full marks from me if they didn't have an issue with roaches. As its stands I wouldn't want to book in there again as  you could not be guaranteed a roach free stay which is a very basic requirement and not too much to ask of a 5 star hotel.,Date of stay: July 2008,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Edinburgh,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VixenEdinburgh
Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,FamilyfromDevon wrote a review May 2008,50,An oasis of calm,We stayed at the Koutoubia for 4 nights in April with our 10 year old son. We booked the cheapest type of room which had a window overlooking the road outside which we found quite interesting watching all the comings and goings and we did not find it noisy. The room itself was huge with a large lounge area where the hotel had made up a bed for our son and it had a large flat screen TV nicely appointed bathroom and all the trappings you would expect for this level of hotel. The room was quite hot and although the air-conditioning did seem to work it didn't really cool down the room - we asked for it to be looked at but it didn't really get any better - other people have mentioned the a/c being ineffective and I guess it would be more of a problem if the weather was very hot.    We found the whole experience of the hotel very pleasant and a really beautiful calm environment to escape from the hustle and bustle of the medina. The location is excellent as you can pop out into the heart of Marrakech and nip back after a couple of hours when the heat or haggling get too much. We chose this hotel rather than a riad as we wanted more space for our son and the benefit of the pools. We used the main pool and the roof pool and they were both rather cold and only waist deep so more for ornament and a quick cooling dip than any serious swimming. We ate in 3 of the restaurants (not the french) and found the food and service excellent. The asian restaurant on the roof is particularly lovely. The whole hotel is very tastefully decorated and there are some gorgeous rooms around the main pool area where you can sit and relax or have a drink. The undergound spa area is very stylish and provides a very relaxing ambiance but the massage I had was rather routine not helped by the fact that the masseuse didn't speak any English and my French vocabulary doesn't include many words relating to massage! The pool in the spa is deliciously warm but beware - the steps extend under the water on both sides and have very sharp edges I cut my knee swimming too close to them.    Some reviewers have complained that the staff don't speak English - what do you expect you are in Morocco! We found that the main waiting and reception staff spoke very good English and we enjoyed practicing our French with the other staff who were all very polite and friendly. I really can't understand why some reviewers have not liked this hotel - it may not have the levels of service you would find in 5* hotels in London or America but personally we had a lovely time there and would return if we ever visited Marrakech again (which we probably won't!).,Date of stay: April 2008,Trip type: Traveled with family,England UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FamilyfromDevon

Our rooms A/C did not work and we had a hard time trying to get someone to fix it.    We finally were moved (after 2 days!) to another room on a less sunny part of the hotel. We felt like we were in France as the clientele were French and the staff spoke French. Few people spoke English. We were surprised to see French women going topless especially since we were in a Muslim country. The location is near the busy square in the medina. Which may be a plus for some. But I would have definitely preferred a Riad....we stayed in many beautiful riads on our trip around Morocco with genuine Moroccan hospitality and food. This definitely did not feel like old Morocco in any way shape or form. We could have been in Europe. The birds pecking at the bread baskets at the buffet in the morning were an interesting addition. We would recommend a beautiful restaurant near the hotel but not related to it.....""Nawama"" gorgeous and very romantic.",Date of stay: April 2008,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Santa Fe, New Mexico",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tapatia

The whole hotel is a wonderful escape from the hectic Medina the brilliant location means no cabs and crazy driving just wander out of the souks to the tranquility of the main pool. My only advice would be to try and get a patio facing room the most noise you will get is the tweeting birds and cicadas and also possibly take a travel bath plug as they don't come as standard and shower curtains don't seem to exisit but hey for the lovely rooms with rose petals there each time the room is made up it is a small sacrifice..... we will definately return.,Date of stay: March 2008,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Epsom, Surrey",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Treacle20

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,David H wrote a review Feb 2008,30,Good location,This hotel has a great location very close to the main square. The style of the hotel is a change from the large chain hotels and does feel tas if they have tried to have a Morrocan influence.    We had a junior suit which was spacious and kept clean. Think more high class rustic charm rather than perfect finish and the rooms should meet your expectations.    The staff where pleasant and helpful. There are plenty of nooks and cranies to hide away around the pool. And there are some good views from the roof top pool which is nicely heated.    One issue that should be pointed out is the hawkers outside the hotel who will tell you they have just finished their shift (they saw you earlier remember!).

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,HobartEssex wrote a review Feb 2008,30,"Delicious food, central location, but falls short of 5 star luxury",The four restaurants were excellent with varied choice of menus - remember to make a reservation particularly for the Moroccan and Indian restaurants. The central courtyard is beautiful with fig and orange trees as well as many rooms to sit in for reading playing board games and cards etc. One room has a fire which is lit every evening - perfect for the time of year.  We were fortunate to have above average temperatures for our stay however we were unfortunate to have a 'Medina' room overlooking the street as it was stifling and too noisy to open a window. After two requests to have our air conditioning looked at we discovered the heating is on at this time of year (February) in the hotel. So be aware that you are not booking an air/con room at this time of year!  Excursions are available from the reception - but lack any kind of information regarding itinerary or overall cost. Our four hour 'City Tour' turned into a one hour trip to a carpet shop - accompanied by Ali Babar! If heading to the Atlas Mountains wear good walking boots and warm clothes as you will be faced with a treacherous climb to a disappointing cascade of water! The price of the guide is additional and should be negotiated before setting off.  The peaceful haven in this bustling city is the El Badi Palace - well worth a visit.,Date of stay: February 2008,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Essex,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HobartEssex
Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,CC55VC wrote a review Feb 2008,40,Oasis of calm,Finding a central hotel with good facilities in Marrakech with consistently good reviews on Trip Advisor wasn't easy so when we arrived at Les Jardins de La Koutoubia we were absolutely delighted and relieved that our homework had paid off.    The hotel is a wonderful oasis of calm ideally situated just a couple of minutes stroll around the corner from the commotion and chaos of Place Jemaa el Fna and the souks. I would not like to stay further away from the square - especially when it's hotter in the summer - as it's quite a walk to the square from some of the hotels we saw in the new town and getting taxis can be such a chore.    We found all the staff extremely friendly and helpful although we wish we'd brushed up on our French to make life easier throughout our visit to Marrakech. The hotel facilities were good although I would have preferred the pools to have been heated. There was free internet access in the basement and a shop off the reception selling souveniers postcards (plus stamps) and international newspapers plus an ATM cash machine. Next time this shop will definitely be my first stop on arrival in the hotel in order to buy something before heading out into the city just to get some small change which is extremely useful but can be difficult to come by.    It was fantastic having the Piano Bar to relax in before and after dinner (nice touch to give complementary nuts and olives and the Koutoubia Cocktail was scrummy!) and all the food we had in the hotel's restaurants was delicious. We dined in all of them except Le Relais De Paris which looks wonderful from the roof of the hotel looking down into the restaurant garden with the pool and huge mirror but it's just around the corner in an alley which put us off a bit - to be fair the alley is fully lit and has security guards on duty we just ran out of time to go there.    The Les Jardins de La Koutoubia hotel is very photogenic and restful - lighting is everything - there is even plenty of seating indoors if it's too hot or raining. Check out the Moroccan chap in the blue outfit who sits by the fireplace in the evening rotating his fez to make that wierd noise whilst playing the guitar. The vases of roses and displays of rose petals (including on the sinks in the washrooms) add to the magic.    For me the highlight of our stay in the hotel was having a his and hers hammam in the spa followed by his and hers Moroccan Massage - absolutely the best massage I've ever had - an experience I shall never forget in a hotel I will remember with great affection.,Date of stay: February 2008,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Walton-on-Thames,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CC55VC

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,R E wrote a review Nov 2007,50,Wonderful experience,We booked this hotel because of the location as recommended here but we were slightly apprehensive due to some of the negative reviews. Our experience was excellent. From the moment we arrived every member of staff was warm and helpful from the guy that cleans the pool to the receptionists. Our room was spotless with rose petals arranged in the bathroom and the bedroom on arrival. We ate in three of the hotel restaurants all of which were great and the piano bar is terrific. There is a central swimming pool surrounded by a courtyard off of which are some 'random' soft furnished rooms where it's possible to escape with a book if you want to. At one end of the courtyard is an open area where you can sit and in the evenings this had a roaring log fire - the most romantic of settings.The location as mentioned before is perfect. Turn left and in two minutes you are at the Jeema square or turn right and in one minute you are on avenue Mohammed V. Yet despite this when you come back to the hotel you are into an oasis of calm. The spa area is first class with a large pool and many treatment rooms if you are into that.

We had a mini suite (room 170) and it was lovely having a seperate sitting room and further seating area on a balcony which overlooked a small pool ( didnt go in it as it was so dirty) a bathroom so big that you could have a party in it 2 40inch flat screen tvs complimentary fruit basket water and toiletries    The down side is the sheer lack of service we had to wait upon arrival almost 3 hours because our room hadnt been serviced the breakfast lacks variety bread always stale coffee always cold.    Although the hotel has 4 restaurants their menus are bland the staff on the reception area are constantly overcharging we were overcharged on 2 occasions for room service and bar bills and on departure having settled our final bill the previous day they tried to charge us again and became very rude and intimidating with no offer of an apology    Although the hotel is a delight to look at especially at night when it turns into a fairy tale setting with all the lanterns it lacks atmosphere being very morose and sombre.    I certainly will not be returning to Marrakech (hated it) but if you put this hotel in another city not sure if I would book again,Date of stay: October 2007,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/makas
Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,marrakechcomon wrote a review Oct 2007,40,Excellent Location,Just returned on Saturday from Marrakech after a really relaxing 5 night break at Le Jardins de La Koutoubia. The location cannot be faulted just yards away from the square and everything that goes with it !! Our mini suite - room number 50 - was superb. This was on the ground floor and tucked away into a corner looking out on to a small patio area and only steps away from the exclusive pool for that area. The main pool is lovely but we preferred the quiet of the pool beside the room infact we were usually the only people in it. The terrace for the room was a welcome retreat from the hustle and bustle of the square and furnished with a group of comfy chairs looking on to the Koutoubia minaret....no need to set your alarm for an early wake up call !!! We enjoyed the food and ate in each restaraunt - the indian on the roof terrace was excellent as was the morrocan french and the international which we ate in twice. We also had the Hamman which was good the spa is undergoing some work at the present which will extend it quite a bit. the pool in the spa is stunning and very relaxing. I also had a massage which again was excellent. We have now been to Marrakech twice and cannot wait to go back. All in all an excellent time was had.,Date of stay: September 2007,,"Aberdeen, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marrakechcomon

Service was mixed but overall pretty decent - a few room service orders got mixed up but always delivered with a smile. Pool and spa were great although they could do with cranking up the air conditioning in the gym. Room was fairly ordinary but comfortable enough. Biggest complaint was the noise. I was on the second floor but the noise from upstairs was ridiculously loud. I think the hotel perhaps hasn't been built as solidly as one would expect. Food decent enough and I thought reasonably priced. Would stay here again.,Date of stay: September 2007,,"Oxfordshire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Matt70380

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,richard_twelvetrees wrote a review Jul 2007,40,Relaxation Personified,"This hotel is great. My wife and I stayed for x 4 nights from 5th July 2007. We had a standard room and just relaxed by the pool in the main. The hotel arranged our collection from the airport (200 DIH each way for x 2 passengers) this is about £12GBP each direction. Frankly this is a bargain as I for one can't be bothered with haggling with a taxi driver after a flight. We had no issues with the accommodation or staff. Our room was a standard double a mini suite would be nice but our room overlooked the main courtyard which contains the excellent swimming pool and sun loungers. Be quick to grab a sun lounger in the morning (I would recommend those closest to reception on the restaurant side for the longest afternoon sun) as there can be a shortage of beds depending on occupancy levels.  The hotel is the process of building a roof top pool this I think would be ready mid August 2007. This will be a great addition as there will be ""longer"" sun until perhaps 7pm. This new roof pool by the excellent Indian restaurant will increase the number of pools to x 4 the people from Clarins are a bit stuffy about using the one in the spa unless you have a treatment but you can ""blag"" your way in for a quick dip. Food is great in the hotel not overly expensive breakfast is of good quality and an outdoor table adds to the occasion. I would recommed eating out on at least a few occasions. We ate at La Foundouk (get a roof terrace table) and Da Moha (get a poolside table). Both offer good food and service / atmosphere.  The only sites we saw where: 1) Jemaa el Fna square which incidentally is about 3 minutes on foot from the hotels front door and 2) Majorelle Gardens about a 10 min taxi - do not pay more than 20 DIH each way for x 2 passengers.  The worst thing about this holiday was the air line - Altas Blue. Make sure you eat well before getting on the catering is a joke and needs to be paid for.  Book this property - it is great for an romantic ""get away"" - I did not see one resident under 20 year of age so no kids to wind you up and ruin the relaxation.",Date of stay: July 2007,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Banbury,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/richard_twelvetrees

No issues about services: the staff was always very helpful and prompt. Very clean and huge room. We got a new patio room looking at a new courtyard (by the way very nice). The room (n.156) was very roomy clean with a flat screen TV huge bathroom and a wonderful terrace (I would say the best one of the hotel). Only issue is the noise from the hallway and the from the stairs which are close to the room. The hotel s really an oasis in the chaos of the medina. It is a few steps from the place Jemaa el F'naa (this is really a bizarre place) however when you enter in the hotel you find calm and peace. The pool is nice with many sunbeds (please don't take places hours in advance with towels it's a shame!); the water is very cold! We took dinner 3 times in hotel in different restaurants (Moroccan Indian grill): quality service choice very good. Prices quite above average. If back to Marrakech I would try to stay in a riad (payoing attention to the selection in term of quality and location) however this hotel in a very good choice as price quality location (that cannot be better!).

The entrance hall with view of pool is attractive and they give you mint tea on arrival. Our ""patio"" rooms were spacious with good bathrooms and a very small terrace overlooking a formal garden. However we had booked a twin and a double and got two doubles. No twins available so our grown-up daughter slept in the smallish double and our 6 ft son slept three nights on the sofa. Reception staff were unhelpful and disinterested and said we would have to take it up with our travel agent on return. The way they dealt with other issues left a lot to be desired as well - more training needed. Everywhere very clean and fragrant. Lots of flowers.    Breakfast pretty good with efficient service. Didn't try dinner.    The pool is very attractive but quite cold and there aren't enough sunbeds so we never sat on one. This happens in so many hotels. Pools should be a pleasant temperature with plenty of sunbeds. I only saw one person swim. However they have very nearly completed a roof top swimming pool and deck area which will be fabulous and we sat up there - very few guests knew it was there so we had it almost to ourselves.",Date of stay: April 2007,Trip type: Traveled with family,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gourdon
Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,maddogHereford wrote a review Apr 2007,40,Starstruck,This is a modern hotel just a 2minute walk from the Djem al fna and as such is ideally located for the main attractions (and handy should you need to nip back to your room promptly!)  We found the reception staff to be friendly fluent in several languages and even negotiated a discount price with a free upgrade to a suite. The suite had a large bathroom (the bath was great) huge bed (very very hard) sitting room two plasma screens (though rubbish TV) and a generous balcony overlooking a verdant courtyard; quite a contrast to life on the other side of the hotel wall.  The suite was situated in the new extension but bizzarely it took three seprate lifts to reach it.  The reception area is the older part of the hotel and it opens out on to courtyard with fairly large pool and sun loungers. The piano bar is close by and is the ideal accompaniment to a very civilised poolside G&T.  We did not try the food as the menu looked unpromising and there was plenty of good dining to be had in Marrakech anyway.  The clientel were as expected largely european well heeled and generally middle aged or older though there were one or two younger families.  This hotel is a great sanctuary from the hussle and bustle the heat the smell and so on but doesn't feel at all Moroccan - like many such hotels it could be anywhere.  On the whole I enjoyed my stay here (3 nights) because it was comfortable BUT... the over-riding impression was that this was not a 5 star hotel. I wonder whose star ratings we're talking about. There were minor issues such as dud light bulbs plaster smears not cleaned off bathroom tiles and my pet hate - the room maid knocking you up at 9.15am and actually coming into the room (happened twice) whilst I'm not suitably attired to receive guests!!! The bill also contained an entry for the minibar which we had not used. These minor points could be so easily rectified but personally I would rate the hotel as 4 star.,Date of stay: March 2007,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Hereford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maddogHereford
Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,severus wrote a review Mar 2007,40,Great location....... poor service,The location of the hotel simply cant be faulted. Its very close (five minutes walk) to the centre of the old town and therefore everything that is good about Marrakech.    We had asked the hotel to provide transport from the airport to the hotel - this was perfect and at only £6 per person each way not too expensive. The public areas of the hotel are excellent - the pool in the central couryard very picturesque the piano bar good the new spa facilities also excellent and well priced. The public areas all round very good with lots of places to sit.    The breakfasts were very good with opportuniity to eat outside around the pool which was very nice. We didnt sample any of the other food but there is a snack bar and resturant at the hotel which both looked perfectly fine - there is too much to choose from in the old town.    The rooms are medium size comfortable and fine rather than particularly special. The bathrooms are average. The more expensive patio rooms have a view (only if you stand up!) but there is no verandah or access outside. The rooms are spotlessly clean. Parts of the hotel we obviously being upgraded (bit noisy) - in particular some of the rooms and the rooftop which will improve the hotel further.    The attitude of the staff lets the place down (as noted in other reviews). Service was slow both at reception and in the bar (which is also quite expensive). rather annmoyingly my wife was refused a table to eat on her own one lunchtime at the snack bar around the pool (there were free tables). Checking out was a challenge as the receptionist was trying to do several things at once.

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,robingirl60 wrote a review Feb 2007,50,Great hotel in the BEST location in Marrakech,We stayed here for 5 nights in February and were delighted with everything. To start with our room on the first floor was HUGE - I think perhaps it was a 'mini suite' although we had only paid for a standar room. It had 2 toilets and 2 bathrooms and a large lounge area with big plasma TV (which actually spoiled the look somewhat). It overlooked the small street outside but that didn't matter - the rooms that overlooked the pool would not have been worth the upgrade.The best thing about it was the location - 3 minute easy walk from all the action in the Djemma el Fna square. It was such a nice place to come back to after all the hustle and bustle. The inner courtyard with huge swimming pool and surrounding open lounges was beautiful and fairly quiet. We met other people who were staying in Riyads/Dars in the medina but they did not have the pool and other facilities that we had (2 restaurants piano bar for cocktails before eating out in the vening/brandies and coffee on our return hamman/spa) We also met a couple who were staying in a modern hotel in the new town and spent all their time going backwards and forwards in petit taxi to the square - what a waste of time (and money). We ate in the hotel one night and the food was excellent. We had lunch there in the courtyard almost every day. I think it was good value for money and would stay there again - the photos you see of the small boutique riyads look inviting but I think we made the best choice.,Date of stay: February 2007,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Cheltenham, England",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robingirl60
Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,britripper1 wrote a review Feb 2007,30,what were Conde Naste thinking of?,"Let's get one thing straight: this is not a 5-star hotel. The walls are too thin for a 5-star and the whole place generally too clattery and noisy. If the telly is on in the next room you can hear it clearly; likewise if someone has a hacking cough in the room above - as was the case during our stay. So goodness knows what Conde Nast Traveller were doing when they put it in their 100 best hotels of all time. I wonder about CN I really do. They claim their reviewers never accept freebies but it baffles me how some of their ""top"" hotels get onto their list.    The Koutoubia is a good 4-star. The common parts (except for the gloomy dusty lobbty) are lovely. The pool area is most chic and there's a lovely shady sitting out area at the end with huge sofas and rugs. All very Moroccan. Also the downstairs Moroccan restaurant was great. Food nothing special but fantastic ambiance as one lounged away on cushions feeling like a vizier or whatever they are in Morocco.    The place falls down with the rooms. Ours was distinctly faded and past its best with scuffed basic G-plan style furniture that probably wasn't that great when it was new. The bed was comfortable but the walls were marked and the plaster chipped.

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,RH_NZ wrote a review Jan 2007,50,"Overall, a very plesant stay",We had an excellent experience with this hotel.    Firstly we were upgraded to a superb first-floor room which was rather spacious for a riad-style room with sliding doors opening out to face the pool and sun streaming in all afternoon.    We found the hotel staff to be friendly professional and very helpful. We had none of the poor service mentioned by other review writers.    The facilities were very good - there is an excellent indoor pool and spa area lovely large heated outdoor pool (which you could lie next to on the loungers in the sun all day as people were doing - in January!)  and two good restaurants (both quite well rated by the boutique travel guide we were using).    The breakfast was fine fairly typical for a hotel of this level but nothing special.    The hotel is located right next to the bustling Medina but within the hotels walls is a tranquil oasis - we were even woken in the morning by birds singing within the large hotel courtyard which was a delight! And also by the wailing of the Muslim prayers from the nearby Koutoubia mosque but we found this to be a positive feature rather than a problem.    Overall we thought this hotel was great - you could enjoy several days here without even leaving as the hotel is so well-equipped but partly also because quite frankly there isn't that much decent sight-seeing to do within Marrakech itself.,Date of stay: January 2007,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RH_NZ
Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,Shefnumpty wrote a review Dec 2006,10,Shocking Service,I'll start by saying we didn't stay there - but we did go there for lunch based.    The hotel itself is very lavish with a pool around which the hotel is centred. The reception is very spacious but there seemed to be no staff around to point you in the direction of the restaurant and no one on reception seemed to acknowledge our presence. As a result we wandered around until we found it ourselves - and then stood there at the entrance waiting for a staff member to seat us - we were studiously ignored until we started to make for a table ourselves. At that point we were placed behind a tree - so we had the pleasure of watching staff take the orders and serve people who arrived well after us    The food itself was nothing to write home about - the lunchtime snack menu of any European hotel would not be very much different. Burgers with fries salad steak - that sort of thing. When it did turn up it was passable - but by that point we just wanted to leave - two and a half hours to serve a salad starter and two mains with beer and water...    We weren't dressed like backpackers (not that that should diminish the service received) in fact we were better dressed than some of the residents - but from the off the staff's attitude was wrong and everything they did for us was a inconvenience to them.    For a place for lunch I would suggest the newly opened (in the past 4 months) Villa Flore off Rue Sidi Al Yamani for laid back chic and fine dining - along with the best and coldest bottle of Heineken one could ever want – I don’t think it touched the sides!    At the metal workers market near the Badii Palace – try Kozybar – a Moroccan fusion bar/restaurant. During the day it does slightly Moroccan food – if you call Kebab and Fries traditional! With modern Arabic dance music belting out - during the day it’s a place to sit back and soak up the sun in summer – or huddle round the fires inside in winter as we did on this visit. With wine at about 130Dh a bottle it’s cheaper than 3 beers. In the evening the menu changes to Moroccan/French cuisine with the added bonus that the chef is Japanese and does massive sushi platters. The music comes from a live band sat around the baby grand on the ground floor. A good range of cigars too.    Also try Kechmara in the Gueliz – a retro style bar that does a good set menu of the day for 150Dh (about 10GBP).

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,KateandSteve wrote a review Aug 2006,40,Very glad we stayed there.,I read all the tripadvisor reviews before choosing this hotel. Knowing that I was travelling to a Moslem country I was expecting to hear the call to prayer and cannot understand why other travellers should be surprised or disturbed by it. I think I heard it twice at night in our whole stay and only because I was wakeful.  I found the hotel to be an oasis within the heat and noise of Marrakech. We actually booked a medina room but were upgraded to a poolside room on arrival. Friends with a medina room were equally content and enjoyed having a view of the Koutoubia mosque. Looking at the floor plans we discovered that all the rooms are different sizes because of the shape of the building. Some pool view rooms are the same size as those facing the medina  We enjoyed eating at the hotel on several occasions during our 10 night stay. The poolside Imlil snack bar was good value and the salads were superb. Koutoubia restaurant and Les Terrasses were both good but prices are more at UK levels and therefore not cheap by Moroccan standards.  Service was exemplary both on poolside and in the hotel. We built up an excellent relationship with staff and learned a lot about them. They worked exceptionally hard to keep the hotel immaculate.  I have some minor criticisms I think the management need to address. The maitres d'hotel need to keep a more vigilant eye on the breakfast buffet and think ahead. Things quite often run out and guests are left waiting for the plates/bowls to be replenished especially if they arrive towards the end of breakfast.  My other criticism is that there is no inventory in the minibar. Keep a very close eye on what is in there and what you have or ask the hotel staff to provide an inventory at the start of your stay. They need to be more organised about this.  Pool decor. lighting and food were great with relaxed but professional service. Air conditioning and ceiling fan combined to cope well with 40+ degrees. Nobody could have expected more.  I would definitely stay again.,Date of stay: July 2006,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Newquay, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KateandSteve

Although the pool is amazing and surrounding rooms are decorated in decadent Moroccan style and look faboulous it is all a bit musty and old looking maybe due to August heat but you feel slightly uncomfortable due to lack of friendliness from staff. One recepetionist just bordered on plain rude however the 2nd girl in afternoon's was absolutely charming but we didn't find them particularly friendly although the smile is on the face you can see they are completely disinterested. However cleanliness was good and rooms always kept immaculate even though air conditioning is not great very poor and rooms smelt slightly old and musty. Would recomend you take a guide first time into Souk as it is all a bit of a culture shock but a great way to get to know the right price to pay and the guide will advise you on fair and honest price. The Moroccan people were charming and very polite in Souks although bit pushy but amazing place to see however the difference between 5 star hotel and poverty outside hotel door did not sit comfortably with me. Great stylish restaurants are: Le Comptoir & Le Foundouk (most romantic) cost about £50 for 2 for meal with drinks only not a bottle of wine. Most other restaurants closed in August so beware if you are going for food.

The staff are very helpful and attentive and we found that they couldn't do enough for us.    There are three restaurants in the hotel. We ate in two of them and the food was very good however we would recommend going out in the city for dinner just to experience the atmosphere of Marrakesh.    We had a guide for an afternoon which we would definitely recommend. The souks really are a rabbit warren of alley ways and as a tourist I doubt we would have ventured to some of the workshops that he took us to which were hugely interesting.

Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,Iain O wrote a review Mar 2006,30,OK but noisy,My wife and I stayed here for 2 nights in March 2006. We were booked for 7 nights but had to return home early due to my wife taking ill (no fault of the hotel or Morocco).    We were slightly disappointed with the hotel which was descibed as 5 star.    The location is superb: on the edge of the Medina 2 minute walk to the Djemaa el Fna square 5 minutes to the souks.    Rooms (we had a patio room) were good although we insisted on changing ours as the first was on an inside corner and felt overlooked by the adjacent family room with a balcony which was at right angles to us. The room we moved to (same floor) was very different and included a small lounge area. The cleanliness and standard of housekeeping was superb.    Our room was very noisy. On the first (Sunday) evening some residents were up late in the courtyard (patio) and it sounded as if they were in the room with us. This went on into the wee small hours. Prayers were called at the nearby Koutoubia Mosque at 5am and there is NO WAY that you will sleep through that!    The breakfast buffet could only be described as mediocre.  Our two dinner experiences were OK but not special. Service was good but the food quality was not great.    Advice on currency: the exchange rate is the same everywhere (airport bank hotel). It's easy to change currency whenever you land at Marrakech airport but I didn't ask for a lot of small (20 & 50 dirham) notes. This then caused problems as you need to tip often. The hotel couldn't help so I headed for the bank - no problem.    Purely a personal preference but if we return to Marrakech after our abbreviated first stay I think we would try different accommodation possibly a ryad.,,,"St. Andrews, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Soapy60

You could not get into the bathroom with two people at once and the bedroom was hardly bigger. So if you stay at this hotel never take the front rooms but opt for the more expensive inner rooms (if available). For us there was no possibility for upgrading because ""this was the room that was booked"" period. Useless to say that service is less than poor: it's arrogant and unfriendly.  Meals are moderate and we cannot understand the possitive reviews in this respect.",Date of stay: March 2006,,"Leuven,Belgium",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andreLeuven_Belgium
Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,moreholidaysplease wrote a review Jan 2006,50,Absolutely lovely!,Like the other reviews posted for this hotel we have to agree and say that this hotel is truly wonderful. We stayed for a week in July 2005 (very very hot!) for a short honeymoon break right after our wedding and because we were honeymooners they gave us a complimentary upgrade to a large room overlooking the pool/courtyard plus a lovely fruit basket to welcome gift.    The service throughout the hotel was great the pool was a calm oasis in the scorching heat and our room was always spotless (everyday the cleaners even came up with a new design for rose petals on our bed!) now that's what you can attention to detail! The food in the hotel was great value and really good but the best bit is that the hotel was literally round the corner from the main square and all the souks.    We had a really relaxing and enjoyable stay here a wonderful way to start married life and we have no hesitation recommending it to everyone. If only all hotels could be as pleasant......,Date of stay: July 2005,,"London, UK",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/moreholidaysplease
Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,Pathfinder16533 wrote a review Jan 2006,10,Not the best - in fact the worst for service,The hotel is beautifully designed but that is the only positive thing I can say about it.  I stayed at the hotel for 3 nights over the New Year.  The food was poor. Our room was missing several important facilities - a phone that worked bath robes hair dryer and a safe. Several rooms are next to a building site and building works starts early with a lot of loud machinery which is disturbing to guests.    The staff were unhelpful and not respectful to women.  My expensive camera was stolen from the hotel on New Year's Day morning from our dinner table (having spent £300 for tickets to the evening's entertainment) but the hotel made no effort for me to retrieve it or even bother to find out the model of the camera or where it had last been seen. I had to demand that they called the police and there was no follow up from staff. It could have been handled 100% better if they had tried to be helpful. Unfortunately the Manager of this hotel shrugged his shoulders and walked away when I tried to ask for help.    This is an pricey 5 star hotel but I believe the service is more like 2 star which is a great shame as it could have been a much better experience.,Date of stay: January 2006,,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pathfinder16533
Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,Kat07009 wrote a review Dec 2005,50,Great hotel.,We have recently returned from 7 days at this hotel and were extremely impressed. It is a calm oasis in the midst of the bedlam that characterises Marrakech. Situated only two minutes away from the Koutoubia mosque and the Square it is ideally placed to explore the city. However this central location means that you are woken in the early hours by the first call to prayer from the mosque!  The rooms are spacious and very well serviced and ours had a great view of the pool. The hotel is set around a courtyard with lovely chill-out rooms surrounding the pool. You can sit around a blazing fire in the winter having a drink taking in the view or there is a piano bar and two restaurants. Whilst the restaurants are very nice we prefered to dine out because there is a huge choice of great restaurants. Our favourites included: Le Pavillion Lolo Quoi and Al Fassia. The hotel staff are friendly and very helpful and overall we were very happy.,,,Liverpool UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kat07009
Les Jardins de la Koutoubia,meatfleece wrote a review Nov 2005,50,stunning,An absolutely stunning hotel. A great place to stay if you're looking for culture. The rooms are amazing and on the whole the hotel is very beautiful. Not a place for families nothing for children to do and no entertainment. It's just a heavenly retreat,,,"Horsham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/meatfleece
