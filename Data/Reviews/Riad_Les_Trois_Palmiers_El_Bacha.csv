Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,LexiV wrote a review Yesterday,50,Beautiful and Peaceful Riad,This is such a beautiful place to stay. It's very calm and peaceful as well especially compared to the sometimes frenetic pace of Marrakesh itself. I had a room on the roof that had it's own rooftop garden. Everyone who worked here was extremely helpful. I was able to arrange both airport pickup and drop off through the hotel and had dinner there my first night as well which was excellent. I only had two nights here which was definitely not enough. I would love to go back sometime.,Date of stay: February 2023,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Cleveland, Ohio",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LexiV
Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,Flip Flop Wanderers wrote a review Mar 1,50,Excellent stay in Marrakech,What a fantastic stay we had at this riad! The rooms are gorgeous and the TWO courtyard were the best! There were even two small swimming pools which were the best to take photos.

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,Jane M wrote a review Feb 2023,50,An absolute gem tucked away in the Medina‚Ä¶..,My husband daughter and I spent 6 nights at Les Trois Palmiers last month and we would thoroughly recommend it. Patrick and his fantastic team looked after us wonderfully - truly nothing was too much trouble for them and there was always a really friendly and personal touch.  The riad is a real gem hidden away in the Medina and the story of how Patrick and Caroline found and renovated the two adjacent buildings is remarkable. It‚Äôs beautifully appointed with all the rooms very individual decorated.  The roof terrace and sunbeds were very welcome after hours of sightseeing.  There‚Äôs a small selection of alcohol on offer including a very nice local red wine. Breakfast was delicious but sad to say I‚Äôve been unable to recreate your delicious mint tea in England!  Thank you Patrick et al - we hope to return! Peter Jane and Georgie,Date of stay: January 2023,,"Havant, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JanePeter23
Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,mark h wrote a review Feb 2023,50,The Best,What a fantastic 4 nights we have just enjoyed here. Everything was perfect beautiful place to stay quiet location but very central. The riad organised to pick us up from the airport Mustafa met us where the driver dropped us off and walked us to the riad. Would have been a bit daunting if we had to find it on our own.  The place is fantastic nothing was too much trouble. We were given tea on arrival and plenty of advice on what to see and do and how to get there. Room was excellent breakfast was great and the rooftop terrace after a long day in the souk was heavenly. Room was made up daily there is a bar drinks menu if you want it and everyone was so helpful and friendly.  On our last night we had a problem over the bill at a local restaurant which was unfortunate. On arriving back at the riad we explained to Ahmed what had happened he went straight to the restaurant called the manager and sorted everything out satisfactorily what an absolute gentleman. We cannot speak highly enough of all the staff brilliant.  Next time we are in Marrakesh we wouldn‚Äôt dream of staying anywhere else. Other tips we changed cash every day at the exchange 200 yards from the riad at very good rates far better than the airport and also on the corner as you come out of the riad is an excellent sandwich stall for a very good snack.,Date of stay: February 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markhT1643WB
Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,Dave F wrote a review Feb 2023,50,AMAZING stay in a traditional Riad,Just arrived back home after 4 magical nights in this amazing riad located right in the heart of the city. It was our first time in Marrakech with our 11 year old daughter and we were a little nervous with not knowing what to expect but the staff went out of their way to make us feel welcome and safe. On our first morning after a delicious breakfast we were given lots of very helpful advice on how to navigate the maze of souks which proved to be so valuable but half the fun is exploring and getting lost. The riad is an oasis of calm in such a vibrant city - stunning rooms exemplary service and great location we loved our stay and would highly recommend discovering it for yourself :),Date of stay: February 2023,,"Penzance, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davefV4981ZY

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,Patrick Weir wrote a review Jan 2023,50,Thank you to 'Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha' and its wonderful staff.,Thank you to 'Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha'.    Myself (Patrick) and Janine had the pleasure of staying at Patricks Riad in January 2023. I cannot praise highly enough how we were made to feel. We were totally welcomed at this wonderful place by *ALL* of the staff. Their help and support in recommending places to go eat and visit was greatly appreciated as well as their help in arranging of information and taxis to and from the airport (and assistance of our luggage). The rooms throughout are characterful and indeed are 'rammed to the hilt' with features that make you feel as if you have entered another era.    The two Riads (to be precise) were situated right in the heart of the Old Medina with wonderful access to the Zouks alleyways and larger trading squares as well as the ancient Palaces Mosques and other places of interest. You will love the interaction with vibrant locals who are only too willing to display their wares as they beckon you into their shops to demonstrate their age-old processes.    Highly recommended for the above as well as the experience of French Arab culture and their ways of doing things.    Thank you.

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,GuideVenturous wrote a review Dec 2022,50,An outstanding stay in the medina of Marrakech,What a beautiful gem in the medina of Marrakech! From the moment we arrived we were blown away by the service provided by this amazing Riad. We were picked up in a luxury van by driver Hamid then walked to the door by smiling Latifa who then gave us a tour of the Riad and welcomed us with some cookies and delicious tea. Our room was one of the most beautiful rooms we have stayed in on our travels. High ceiling and beautiful details. The whole place is stunning the rooftop terrace is perfect for having breakfast relaxing on the sun beds and the views of the city and the Atlas mountains are incredible.

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,Sonia wrote a review Apr 2020,50,Party weekend,I have been in Marrakesh before also staying in a Riad. This one was booked by a member of my family who was celebrating his birthday.  I can‚Äôt recommend this Riad high enough.  Very well located in the middle of the souks. It takes no more than 5 minutes walking from the taxi rank.  We were welcome with the traditional mint tea and lovely little pastries  There are 12 rooms if I remember right and there are 3 terraces. The stunning overview on the M√©dina and the Atlas Mountains are a dream.  The rooms are amazing. Mine was just perfect on the top floor. Immaculate clean. The breakfast was amazing. I absolutely love their gorgeous home made yogurt with honey and the fantastic bread from next door bakery but the best of all is the staff every single one they make you feel more like family instead of guest. Caroline and Patrick should be very proud of what they have achieved.  On our last day we were leaving very early to the airport and we were very grateful that at 5 am we were offered a light breakfast and scorned to the Riad transfer taxi  Unfortunately due to the coronavirus we were the last guest staying at the Riad but I can‚Äôt wait to go back. Absolutely love it!! Thank you for everything you did for us,Date of stay: March 2020,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Liverpool, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SoCaMu67

The riad was a short walk away and we were escorted by a member of the team. Our room was excellent and the whole stay was delightful. We ate dinner in the hotel on one evening and in restaurants recommended by the team on the other nights. All our meals were excellent.

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,Gateway_12 wrote a review Mar 2020,50,Lovely stay at this wonderful Riad,From the momnet you arrive to the moment you leave the staff cannot pay enough attention. When you arrive you are treated to the customary mint tea with some nice small pastries. You are drawn a map as to how to get to the main square (Jemaa El Fna) from the riad as well as other notabel sites. The riad itself is very clean and looked after well. The breakfast served is great. A special note to Mustapah and Ahmed who helped me out a fair bit. The riad is about a ten minute walk from the main square and you have to walk through the souks. To see the way to the square I recorded a video of my walk from the riad to the square (can be found on my IG TV in instragram under ilyasayub1). I cannot fault the riad and would definitely recommend it if you are looking for the riad experience in the middle of the medina.,Date of stay: February 2020,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gateway_12
Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,ChristianaTO wrote a review Feb 2020,50,Great stay with super friendly staff,We had a great stay at this Riad. Very convenient location and easy to get to (once you follow the map that the hotel staff draws for you). The staff are very friendly and open to helping you with any questions or needs that you have. We had an early departure and they set out a small version of the breakfast for us which was very kind. I felt safe and comfortable in our room. The shower was hot and the water pressure was great. The only downside was that the door to the room did not quite meet the wall so with a little gap there you can pretty much hear everything that happens outside your room. Was only a bit of a bother one night when some guests came in late but we were fine. I would definitely recommend this Riad and I would stay here again.,Date of stay: February 2020,,"Toronto, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChristianaTO

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,Michael O wrote a review Jan 2020,50,Beautiful Riad in Heart of Marrakech,Had wonderful stay in this Riad. Patrick and his staff offered us excellent welcome and 1st class service throughout our stay. Riad was lovely clean and exceeded our expectation. Mustapha was brilliat on our arrival so warm and friendly and the following morning he spent time with us giving advice on getting around Marrakech and things to see in the City. Make sure you get his map to get back to Riad as it is very easy to lose your way in the winding streets. The Riad is located in the old city and is walking distance to all the sights.  Highly recommend this Riad.  Tip: Book your airport transfer through Riad. They will pick you at Airport door and get you to Riad with no hassles. Reasonable price.  Tip: Book dinner at least 1 night in Riad. The food and service was amazing.    All in all if you going Marrakech and you want to experience the city and amazing Moroccan hospitality then this is the place! 100%,Date of stay: January 2020,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Safari174793
Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,drunkenpoet wrote a review Dec 2019,50,Wonderful Riad,This is a wonderful Riad in the heart of the Medina. Patrick and Caroline (the Owners) were very helpful and hospitable and the day and evening staff were all friendly efficient and helped with every request. We ate at the Riad on two nights during our 4 night stay and both meals were traditional and tasty especially the soup and smoked aubergine. The room was clean and pleasant and the d√©cor traditional and interesting. All utilities worked perfectly except there was a power cut but this is something inherent to Marrakesh rather than the Riad and it did not effect us. Breakfast was excellent and the team booked us a Hamman airport transfers and helped with recommendations and directions. Perfectly spoken English French Arabic and Italian (possibly other languages) between the staff.  The location is great for the Medina (but you may need a good sense of direction and not be a travel novice). As a fellow traveller reviewed; it is an Oasis of Calm. The Riad is in complete contrast to the hustle and bustle of the medina but that is Marrakesh: The calm of the Riads Jardins Hammams and Terraces and every aspect of life in the streets outside.,Date of stay: December 2019,,"Windsor, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drunkenpoet
Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,Claudia Webster wrote a review Nov 2019,50,An oasis of calm in the medina,I just returned from a three night stay at this riad with with my mother and I can‚Äôt recommend it highly enough. It was an absolute delight to stay here from the moment we arrived. We were served a lovely refreshing mint tea along with some little pastries we were talked through and given detailed maps on how to find our way round the warren of the souks. The staff really made us welcome and nothing was too much trouble for them.  We had dinner in the riad on our first evening and it was the best meal of our stay by far with a wonderful tagine among other courses it was a really enjoyable evening. I would highly recommend to eat here if you‚Äôre staying here.  The riad itself is very stylishly decorated it‚Äôs well maintained and feels very luxurious and has a lovely traditional feel too.  It is well placed about a 10-15 minute walk to the main Jenna el fna square (depending how many shops you look at in the souks on the way!) so was a perfect distance to get there and also it was pretty central to the other attractions like the Bahia palace Saardian tombs and majorelle gardens all of which we walked to from our riad.  After a day traipsing round the souks and sightseeing it was a real pleasure to return to the riad and all the lovely staff there they really made us feel so welcome.

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,Lauren T wrote a review Aug 2019,50,"Incredible Riad, Incredible People",I am so embarrassingly late writing this review (by almost a year) but I think about our time in Marrakech and at Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha at least weekly and I knew it was time to sit down and share how wonderful this place is.    My husband and I traveled to Marrakech in Nov 2018 to celebrate our 15th wedding anniversary. Our time there was magical - I don't know how else to express it. A huge part of that was our stay at this Riad. From the moment we arrived to the time we stepped out for the last time to leave everyone was so kind and giving of their time and information. As soon as we arrived Nour seated us and served us mint tea and cookies and took the time to hand-draw a map and explain the layout of the area for us. Although the alleys and twists and turns were confusing the map allowed us to strike out and explore. Although the hotel didn't have a restaurant per se there was an amazing and delicious breakfast served every morning and we special-requested dinner one night. I believe this was prepared by Dalila and it was beyond incredible. Chicken tagine with multiple side accompaniments and wine. I don't remember exactly how much this cost us but it was something unreal like the equivalent of $60 USD and should have been 3x that amount for what we received. It also happened that we were some of the only people around that night (I think everyone else staying there was out partying haha) and we had the entire open-air area of the Riad to ourselves. Nour created a very romantic atmosphere for us with lots of candles and dim lighting. It was truly one of the most memorable parts of our trip.    We were able to meet one of the owners Patrick on our way out who set up an airport transfer for us and gave us a lot of helpful tips about getting through customs at the airport so we wouldn't miss our flight.    The hotel nightly rate is very reasonable and even though the wifi was hit or miss who cares? I didn't want my nose buried in my phone or ipad while I was there anyhow.    Although we didn't take part I know they offer day tours and other options. One I wished I had done was a cooking class especially after eating Dalila's amazing food. Since I know we'll be back we'll for sure request that add-on.    Overall a lovely and wonderful Riad with genuinely kind and helpful people. I'm so sorry for the tardy review but you all made our time in Marrakech extra special and I sincerely thank you.,Date of stay: November 2018,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/laurent298
Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,Katy wrote a review Jun 2019,50,"If you visit Marrakesh, stay here!",I can't say enough good things about this Riad we loved every second we spent here. We wouldn't stay anywhere else the next time we come to Marrakesh and there WILL be a next time.    The staff are incredible everything is amazing but the staff make it perfect! They are so kind and helpful. Each day when we came in from sight seeing they were genuinely interested to hear how our day had been and couldn't do enough for us. Everyone made my husbands 40th birthday holiday very very special.    The breakfast is delicious the location is ideal it's peaceful and quiet after a busy day sightseeing. The building and all it's features are stunning. We also had dinner here one night which was outstanding when you stay here I recommend it! We stayed in 2 different bedrooms before and after our desert tour. Both where unique beautiful and comfortable we slept like babies every night!    I honestly could go on for hours about how good this place is. If we could give more than 5 stars to rate this place we would! I felt quite emotional leaving this wonderful place.

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,Elizabeth G wrote a review Apr 2019,50,Great service with King Nour!,We really enjoyed our stay at this riad. We were met at the airport and driven to the medina as we had requested. Nour greeted us and walked us to the riad. He is very charming:). The riad is located down some alleyways but I liked that - made it interesting. Nour drew us a great map to get us to the square. The room was nice/clean and the beds were comfortable. The shower drain was clogged but we didn't mention it. The breakfast was good compared to the other riad where we stayed. I liked that they served yogurt for a protein and the bread was good quality. Nour arranged a walking tour for the next day. We only stayed two nights and since we were going on a tour to the desert and limited to what we could take we left most of our luggage and our newly bought rugs at the riad. Nour delivered all of this to our second riad in the pouring rain when we got back to Marrakech! Really exceptional customer service. In addition he set up a second walking tour for us at the last minute with the same guide we had the first day even though we had checked out of the riad! I wish we had stayed there the whole time but we wanted to try different riads. The other staff was also very good. I would say that the place needs some updating in the public areas such as the cushions but overall it was great!,Date of stay: March 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizabethgI7204MQ
Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,posts933 wrote a review Mar 2019,30,hotel needs updating,When we arrived here I was not impressed the driver of the hotel dropped us off and we had to walk through all these alleys to get to this place we arrived eventually we were greeted by the staff they were fine ask to sit and had to explained now to get back and for the time we had there we were lost every time going back you must remember the bakery and the mosque and the restaurant Medina on the corner I did not like the room no TV and very dull brown and the bathroom is a bit old and it did not open to see anywhere only a big palm tree in the middle of the floor looking down at the breakfast room you had to climb a lot of stairs to go to the top and also you had to order your dinner or lunch to be cooked for you so if you arrive late you will not have a evening meal do not know what it is like in the summer we did find a TV but that was not brilliant either the only best thing about it we were in the SUK. if I wait back I would stay in the new part they are hotels near the big square I did like the staff but not the alley ways.,Date of stay: March 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Cambridge, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/posts933

Then we reached outside the Medina locals scam you. They pretend to help saying - ‚ÄúHotel sent me‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take you to your hotel‚Äù ‚Äúyou do not have to pay anything‚Äù.. they pretend that they are helping and showing you the way. 1 min help costed us ‚Ç¨10. Please do not take help from local - who say ‚Äúyou are lost‚Äù ‚Äúway is closed‚Äù ‚Äúcome I‚Äôll show you the way‚Äù.. biggest scam in Marrakesh. They are all over Medina. Sad thing is they are young kids scamming you instead of progressing their life in a more meaningful way. Now if I were lost in Medina I would ask the shopkeeper. Please do not entertain discussion with the boys who will walk with you to show you way. Maps.me app helped us inside Medina. It works offline.    Praise God! For the two employees Noor and Mustafa who greeted us in the hotel. Noor gave us the best service. Very friendly and went out of his way to help us and make sure that our views of Marrakech was not based on the few bad people.    Hotel was real nice. Very conveniently located. I would recommend the hotel only because of Noor. Mustafa was nice too - but Noor was the best. He made a difference for our stay.

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,"LogyBayTraveller, Newfoundland wrote a review Oct 2018",50,An excellent oasis in the medina with excellent staff!,My wife and I and another couple from Newfoundland stayed at this Riad for 3 nights 25-27 Sept. The Riad is located in an alleyway off the souk about a 2-3 minute walk. We walked it several times including after dark and found it very safe. The reception staff consisting of Nour Mustapha and Ayoube welcomed us with open arms sought to meet our every need and were an invaluable source of knowledge about navigating the souk and medina. We ate a delicious dinner (lemon chicken tagine + mezze) first night at the Riad and had breakfast delivered each morning to the rooftop terrace. We signed up for a cooking course on the first morning given by Riad cook Dalila and were led through the souk by Nour to buy/bargain our ingredients for beef tagine with couscous cooked in traditional 7 steams ( ~ 140 minutes) and 3 appetizers (mezze) plus desert. Dalila speaks Arabic and French and with Nour's help as translator we thoroughly enjoyed the session. We also had the Riad book a private walking tour of Bahia Palace Saadian Tombs and Kasbah and learned a lot about the history of Marrakesh. The rooms were beautiful incorporating many features of traditional architecture and were clean and comfortable. Staff arranged and walked us to a private car to take us to the airport. Highly recommend this Riad for exceptionally caring staff wonderful setting and great food. Download Mapsme.com and use it offline to find your way through the souk - forget google or imaps because of slow updates in the alleyways. Wifi at Riad is strongest in the lobby.

You genuinely felt like you were being welcomed as part of the family. If possible you should at least eat in the Riad once in the evening as the whole experience and food was wonderful. It's also worth doing a private trip from the Riad into the Atlas mountains which they will tailor to your needs. would recommend staying here without reservation and if we come back to Marrakech I would stay here again.

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,Vicki F wrote a review Jul 2018,50,Perfection!,My husband and I stayed at Les Trois Palmiers for part of our honeymoon. We arranged to be picked up from the airport by their driver & from the moment we arrived we felt so welcome & cared for. Our luggage didn‚Äôt make it out of Spain & we were sure that would ruin our stay but the Tres Palmiers staff were so warm and helpful that it didn‚Äôt. Nour served us delicious mint tea upon our arrival and drew us a map to make sure we could find our way around. We loved how close the Riad was to everything in the Medina. Within a few hours we were comfortable roaming through the winding alleys thanks to Nour‚Äôs map.  Our room was magnificent. Friends of ours had contacted Patrick ahead of time to set up a little surprise for our arrival so when we entered we found our bed decorated with roses & petals & a beautiful spread of snacks & champagne. This was the perfect compliment to the already fabulous decor.  On our 2nd day we were served a delicious breakfast on the terrace outside our room & then walked to meet our driver for our private tour of the Atlas Mountains & Ourika valley. Our driver Hamed was very friendly & knowledgeable. He stopped at several picturesque points along our way. Our hiking guide Mohammed was absolutely incredible. I got pretty nervous on our way up to the waterfalls (fear of falling) & almost turned back but he was so calm & supportive the whole time. He literally held my hand the whole way to make sure I was safe & comfortable. I couldn‚Äôt thank him enough for helping make that experience possible.  I could go on & on but the bottom line is my husband & I were blown away by the warmth hospitality and beauty of the Tres Palmiers & their staff. We hope to come back some day & will definitely highly recommend it to anyone we know heading to Marrakech.

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,cavv123 wrote a review May 2018,40,1st time in Marrakech and 1st time in a Riad,We spend 4 days in Marrakesh and didn't know what to expect with our selected lodging. We were picked up promptly at the airport by the Riad's driver (We booked that in advance) and after a 15min drive were brought to the Riad. Well...someone met us at the street and walked us to the Riad. People were friendly and our check in was quick and smooth. Our room was overlooking the center courtyard. It was all very quiet. It seemed like no one was staying there. Our room was nice and spacious but it was dark. I'm not a fan of dark rooms or bathrooms (Very hard to shave my face with limited light) but this is probably due to the small windows and limited light fixtures in the room.  We got an explanation from the person that opens the door on how to get to the square and we headed out. He also took the time to explained some of the private tours the hotels offers (Expensive) but once you tell him you prefer group tours he will stop with his pitch and move on.  There isn't an official front desk as a hotel would have but there was always someone near the front door that lets you in and out of the Riad.  The breakfast was decent. Bread a couple of pastries coffee tea and fruit.  So having a room in the courtyard has its drawbacks in my opinion. Whenever there are people hanging out there you can hear everything because the rooms are not fully sealed. There were a couple of nights in which people were there talking and laughing until late and we could hear everything clearly. So if you want more privacy.. ask for a room away from the courtyard.  Well...it was a good experience to stay at a Riad due to the proximity to the square but I realized that I'm more of a fan of the structure logistics and privacy a hotel can provide.,Date of stay: May 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Waltham, Massachusetts",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cavv123
Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,Liliana E wrote a review May 2018,40,Top of the notch Riad.,We got to Marrakech in the early evening and were greeted by two guys of the staff.  We had 2 double rooms and one double room with 2 single beds. They showed us the double rooms which were nicely decorated. One on the first floor of what I would say is the oldest riad and the other one on the second floor of the same side. The room that was supposed to be two single beds was a double bed. They apologized because the riad was in full occupancy and did not have availability for a two single bed room but they promised they would change that the next day and they surely did.  The rooms are so unique big with beautifully decoration details in a truly Moroccan style the linens and towels were high end.  The only thing was a bad smell that came from the bathroom like a humidity smell. As soon as I told them they brought me a oil diffuser and that helped somehow. And the first night was a kind of noisy.  All the spaces the stairs the rooftop are decorated top of the notch.  The staff was very nice but I believe the first day they were short in staff so the breakfast took a long time to be served the 2nd morning they had much more people helping so that went smoother.

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,missiesw wrote a review Feb 2018,50,Perfect Marrakech Riad!,I spent three perfect nights here recently. Patrick reached out before my arrival to offer airport transfers which I thankfully accepted. Having never visited Marrakech and not speaking either Arabic or French I was apprehensive about securing a taxi. A staff member met our transfer and escorted us through the Medina to the Riad which was inaccessible by car. This made the decision to accept the transfer offer even more important. For first time visitors to Marrakech navigating around the Medina is tricky even in the age of Google maps. Upon arrival at the Riad itself guests are served their choice of water soda or mint tea along with an assortment of Moroccan desserts.    The location was ideal - adjacent to the souk and an easy walk to the Jemaa el-Fna (square) the Bahia Palace the Saadian Tombs and the Koutoubia Mosque. There are multiple restaurants nearby.    The rooms were good sized and had all necessary amenities including robes.    Complimentary breakfast could be served on the rooftop terrace with views across the city or in any of the dining areas within the Riad. Breakfast included an assortment of breads fresh yogurt and fruit.    As an added bonus we were able to take a cooking class with the Riad's cook with delicious results.

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,Laura N wrote a review Jan 2018,50,Decent Riad,Stayed with 2 friends in a triple room for 1 night. We arrived late and were met at our taxi by the Riad staff. The room was clean beds comfortable and a good bathroom. Check in was a little disorganised but we were made to feel welcome and warm! Wifi is patchy and the stairs up to the rooms have a short tread but there are downstairs rooms available. Breakfast was good the usual bread jams and pancake things. We met the owner in the morning and he gave us some good suggestions of where to go. The only complaint is it takes them a long time to open the door (There are 2 doors) and the Riad is down a quiet alley so don't be scared to knock very loudly.,Date of stay: January 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Epsom, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lauran270

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,Morado wrote a review Dec 2017,30,Mixed review,Booked literally 10 hrs before landing and airport pick-up was arranged when booked through the hotel's website directly. Free of charge. The drive spoke good English and explained the city en route to the hotel. Extremely helpful.    Wonderful location in the heart of the tourist attractions. It's in the alleyways but the driver and the hotel staff communicated in advance so the hotel staff picked me up from the drop off point. He took care to explain the location very thoroughly so I won't get lost. He was very detailed w maps and pointed out the attractions around the riad. Super helpful.  All the staff had warm wonderful hospitality.  They booked the hamam brought up the tea to my room etc.    Downside are the room and wifi. Take time to read comments from guests who gave a poor rating. They were justified in hind sight. I booked the cheapest room on the top floor with a balcony Bahia. While the private balcony is great to enjoy the sunset that's the only nice thing about the room I'm afraid.    No WIFI reception from inside Bahia room. A reviewer commented on it a couple of yrs ago on this very site and it was still NOT fixed in 2017. When I brought up the poor reception to the owner and staff they mentioned internet connection itself is unstable in the old part of town. No it's a router problem. Wifi works very well downstairs but not in Bahia room. They placed in the router diagonal from Bahia in the farthest corner outside. Do NOT book Bahia if you need WiFi from the room. Wish they'd fix it or at least put a disclaimer for Bahia room so guests know what they're signing up to. Instead of chasing the owners for Wifi.    Bahia room was tiny and I would not return to stay in the same room. Not a good value of money. Can't comment on other rooms.    Check-out procedure: would recommend settling the bill the night before if you're catching an early morning flight.    The place would have received five stars for the attentive service except for neglecting the Wifi issue and the tiny room.,Date of stay: December 2017,Trip type: Traveled solo,yangon,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/moradok

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,Sybiel S wrote a review Oct 2017,50,An amazing time,At ariving we felt very welcomed by Patrick and his wife Caroline. Entering the Riad felt as entering a fairy tale. I have never seen a Riad and i found it so much nicer than a usual hotel. There are no windows but we didn't miss that at all.The sky in the middle of the Riad is wonderful. Patrick and Caroline are such nice people! And their staff is dedicated to please every wish of the guests and they are so friendly as well. There are several places where you can enjoy your breakfast. Our first two days the sun was lacking unfortunately. But later we could enjoy breakfast on the roof terras which is lovely. I read in a review that someone forgot the lower entrance of the Riad entree. Every time we went out the staff reminded us to bent a little bit. Patrick took time to tell us about the realisation of the Riad. They spent so much time and effort in creating this lovely place. Also the Riad is located superb in the Medina. No cars just donkeys so nice. Moroccans are very fond of mopeds which i found annoying. I should suggest the government to stimulate bicycles. More quiet cheeper cleaner and healthier.  Patrick and Caroline helped us to arrange all kinds of visits to go to. The Hamman Atlas mountains nice restaurant and even to have a relax moment in their garden near the swimming pool. We got a lovely lunch there of Latifa. Super afternoon surrounded by 50 olive trees.  i can advise everybody to go and visit this Riad.,Date of stay: October 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sybiels

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,dianebC8109NE wrote a review Oct 2017,20,Good service but poor value for money,Immediately prior to our 2 night stay at the Riad les Trois Palmiers we stayed at a marginally cheaper riad nearby which provided a good point of comparison. Patrick and his staff were very welcoming and kind enough to allow us to keep our room until 6pm on our day of departure. Riad les Trois Palmiers deserves its good service awards however the standard of the accommodation and value for money fell well short of expectations. I booked one of the lower priced rooms and on arrival Patrick kindly gave us a free upgrade to a ‚Äòlarger‚Äô one which measured approx. 12 x 9 feet (Idrisside). This was less than half the size of the room at our previous riad in which we also had very nice banquet seating area. The room had been rearranged since the website photos were taken; there was no TV or seating corner the two chairs were jammed in the small space between the bed and the side wall and the wall light switches were no longer next to the bed. There was very little space in which to put our suitcases without falling over them. The bed was comfortable the linen good quality and the internet worked but whereas our previous riad had been freshly and tastefully decorated at Riad les Trios Palmiers the d√©cor and furnishings were dull and tired. In the bathroom the tiling and taps looked like they needed a good deep clean. Some of the dispensers for the toiletries were broken and there was an unwrapped (used?) bar of soap left on the shelf in the shower. The cracked shower head worked well but the water drained very slowly despite removing the plughole grill as suggested by one of the staff.  The homemade yoghurt was delicious but we avoided the pancakes because there were a number of hairs on them and the French pastries were rather dry. Our previous riad offered a much wider choice and a far better quality breakfast; needless to say we didn‚Äôt opt to eat dinner!  Because Riad les Trois Palmiers is two joined properties it has the feel of a small hotel and the larger number of guests means more potential for noise. We were disturbed by loud talking and laughing late at night and the close proximity to a mosque meant that we were woken before daybreak by the call to prayer. Additionally our sleep was disturbed by something mechanical cutting in and out through the night for which a staff member could give no explanation. The riad organised an airport transfer for which we were charged 150dhs (less than advertised) but instead of using one of their drivers as suggested on their website they hailed us a taxi. When we arrived at the airport the driver seemed concerned that we may have been overcharged and asked what we had paid; he told us that he had been given just 70dhs for the journey.  Given how pleasant Patrick and his staff were I‚Äôm sorry to post a poor review but based on my experience there are other cheaper raids nearby which offer a significantly higher standard of accommodation and better value for money than the Riad les Trois Palmiers.,Date of stay: October 2017,,"Bristol, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dianebC8109NE

Our room was lovely with everything you would need we had breakfast every morning and the staff were all delightful and would do anything to help.    The location of the riad is right next to the souks and just a short 10 minute walk to the main square (unless you get lost in the souks in which case it's about 3 hours!)

Service is excellent and all the staff and the owner are great and friendly people.    The only down side was that the wifi was working quite poorly and sometimes we didn't have any signal in our room on the top floor.

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,bobandrewsjr wrote a review Oct 2017,50,Perfect Marrakech riad experience - live the fantasy!,This place blew us away - first of all it is in a quiet part of the medina down small alleys and then you walk through a nondescript door into a beautiful riad (there are actually two riads connected by a passageway). Patrick the owner gave us a tour showing how the original house was renovated and the addition of the house next door. Everything is done with such great taste and comfort retaining the essence of Morocco but with the modern comforts (eg air conditioning tv plunge pools). The rooms are nicely appointed with luxurious sheets and towels. Staff could not have been more helpful/nice (they bend over backwards to help you) they serve wine and beer (yay!) and the dinner we ate there one night was the best meal I had in my two weeks in country. I just can't imagine how our stay in the medina could have been any better. Make sure you contact them about directions for the first time you go there - they met us at a nearby taxi location and guided us to the riad.

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,pennykim wrote a review Oct 2017,20,There Are Better Options For Value,The riad is tucked away behind the Bacha. When my airport transfer had to drop me off at the end of the road due to narrow alleyways the riad's owner refused to send someone to walk with me to the riad for the first time and hung up on the driver asking for directions even though it would only take 2 mins from the road intersection to the front door of the riad. I'm a young and well traveled person and getting lost is no big deal but this lack of common courtesy left me with a bad taste in my mouth.    My room was on the top floor and it was fine but not worth $85 / night (the rate I paid via Travelocity). The A/C didn't cool the room below 80 degrees the wifi was spotty and the shower in the bathroom is literally next to the sink and toilet. I'm a small framed person and it was even cramped for me! The breakfast is good but I would get twice as much food and twice the quality in another riad 10 minutes away. The other riad was also cheaper and more luxurious than this one and they offered to pick me up and walk me from the Bacha! I found pricing for amenities and activities ridiculous - at the time of writing this the riad charges 22 euros for airport transfer. You can get the same thing for 10 dirham. This riad runs on European prices for moroccan standards.    I like you dear reader assumed I would be getting my money's worth according to all the reviews and high ratings but I must say I got ripped off on this one. The breakfast and housekeeping staff were nice and kind people however I would think twice about paying premium for an average riad with limited customer service.,Date of stay: October 2017,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Dallas, Texas",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pennykim

Upon arriving to the Riad Halid offered us some mint tea and drew us a map of Marrakech.

After spending two days walking through Marrakech each time we returned to the Riad we warmly greeted by Halid and the rest of the staff at Les Trois Palmiers and relaxed by the pool and rooftop. Before check out I asked Patrick if one of my friends would be able to leave her bags after checking out since her flight didn't leave until nighttime.

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,Amanda R wrote a review May 2017,50,Great riad in the medina!,After searching through what seems like hundreds of riads in Marrakech we decided on Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha. And we couldn't be happier with our decision. Patrick was most welcoming and gave us the a very private suite on the top floor. The decor was most beautiful and you can tell the care they took to renovate this property.    We did not have a transfer from the train station to the riad but wished we had. Not being familiar with the alleyways of the medina it is easy to get lost and taken advantage of by locals wanting to give you direction. So be sure to arrange with Patrick your transfer to the hotel.    We also loved the location as it was in a more quiet part of the medina but still very central to all the attractions. Definitely would recommend this riad to all those travelling to Marrakech!,Date of stay: April 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Vancouver, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amandar614
Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,tgilgenkrantz wrote a review May 2017,50,Home from Home!,Travelling can sometimes be challenging especially in a new environment but not with the immediate warm welcome you get from the airport pick up from the team of the Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha!! You feel at home with 10 minutes leaving the airport. The location of the Riad is just fabulous especially if you want to live Marrakesh experience to its full potential (medina shopping the delicious room terrace restaurants. late nights..). You always come back to the Riad with someone to welcome you back and always ready to be helpful.  With the experience of both Patrick and Caroline I can certainly recommend this little jewel in the heart on the Medina. I will treasure the 4 amazing days spent there. I will definitely be back there!  Thierry London,Date of stay: May 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tgilgenkrantz

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,MDWAustralia wrote a review Apr 2017,50,Charming Riad,"We spent four nights here in late March. The airport pickup is a must - no idea how we would have found it ourselves! We had requested dinner in the Riad on the first night as we were arriving during the evening and couldn't face the souk. Lovely meal that set the tone for our stay. Breakfast each morning was generous with a different option each day - omelette or crepes etc. The roof terrace is lovely for breakfast - although the bees were out when we visited and were a bit of a menace (but not dangerous).    We had the Saadienne Room on the first floor which was beautiful. The staff were proficient friendly and always willing to help - even if to reassure you that ""yes you will find your way back to the Riad""! The series of laneways to the Riad are a bit daunting at first but a night security guard is on hand after dark - although we never felt the slightest bit concerned.    A trip to the Atlas Mountains with Ali the driver was a highlight. We did the Three Valleys tour. Stunning scenery and a wonderful break from the craziness of the Medina. Had beautiful meals at Cafe Arabe - just a street away - and Riad Idra - in the same lane-way off Dar El Bacha (near the bakery with the wonderful smell of baking bread all day).    Will certainly return (with a spare empty suitcase!)",Date of stay: March 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Australia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MDWAustralia

The different housekeeping ladies were so sweet especially one of them (didn't manage to get her name). Kept the room so very neat and tidy! Nice views from rooftop terrace.

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,hatha101086 wrote a review Feb 2017,50,5 nights,We have just returned from staying at this very well located riad in the medina we spent five lovely nights with breakfast included which was served daily between 8.30-11.00. These times were to ensure noise levels did not wake those who wished to have a longer sleep.  If noise is an issue I would advise anyone to stay in a hotel far out of town and not in any riads they are an oasis of calm from the busy souks and hidden away down an alley however the rooms are all located off of a communal courtyard in the centre so lights sleepers will be woken by the slightest of noises alongside the calls to mosque.  The staff are amazing and friendly and will go out of their way to help us whether it be from a nice mint tea upon our return or with rose petals on the bed. We felt very at home and they all expressed a family home welcoming.  The rooms are exactly as described and shown in the pictures and any help is available of which we chose to book a day trip to the Atlas Mountains they helped arrange our airport transfers and made evening meals available if you pre booked.

We chose this Riad because of its location and 5 star reviews and we were not disappointed! It was a wonderful oasis within the madness of the medina. We stayed in excellent authentic Moroccan rooms on the first floor with lovely bathrooms and windows opening onto the central courtyard. On our arrival we were met at the airport by a driver sent from the Riad ( we arranged in advance direct with Patrick the owner) who then handed us over to Halid who met us at the edge of the Medina ( cars not allowed into medina) who then walked us to the Riad giving us information on the way. Nice personal touch. All the staff treated us like family nothing was too much trouble so helpful and added wonderful thoughtful touches like tea and pastrys when you returned from days out shopping sightseeing etc.weary and sore footed! Another great touch was a security guard to walk you back through the rabbit warren of alleyways when you came back after dark not that we ever felt threatened but not a lot of lighting so glad of the escort with torch. Breakfast is great and we eat dinner in on 2 nights and both times food was excellent ambience was perfect it felt like you were having a private dinner party and after a few glasses of wine we didn't have far to get to bed üòä.

Still as gorgeous as ever the riad is in a fantastic situation on the edge of the souk and a ten minute walk from Jemaa el-Fnaa.    Les Trois Palmiers is hidden away down atmospheric twisting turning alleyways that you will end up happily navigating like a local! Leaving the hectic street life behind you knock on a beautiful studded door and enter a calm comfortable and beautiful space.    The riad has been renovated beautifully. Our room was spacious and spotlessly clean. The bed was great extremely comfortable. The bathroom was beautiful too and there was always plenty of hot water. The wifi coverage was good and speedy throughout the building. Breakfast is delicious (I still think about the bread and homemade yoghurt...!) We asked to have dinner in the riad on the night of our arrival and it was so good! I would actually very much recommend doing that.    So that's all he practicalities... But these are not the things that make this place so special. It is the personal help attention to detail and harmonious atmosphere that made our stay. Patrick Caroline and their team are great! They are always happy to help whether it is drawing you a map making restaurant recommendations or helping you to find the best tiles in the whole of Marrakesh!

I suggest to get this service because there is no way you can find this place in the medina. The riad is designed/decorated with the typical moroccan facade and interiors. They will coordinate trips for you and we were able to get our camel rides and trip to the atlas mountain. The employees are all extra nice and hospitable and made our stay memorable.

The breakfast is great and we chose where we wanted to take it - there are several places to sit and relax in the groundfloor first and second floors. The riad is very beautiful and so are the rooms. They have two pools which is amazing if you're travelling in July or August. Mr. Patrick the owner was very friendly and helpful as well.  By the end there was a little problem since they had tried to reached us through booking regarding the payment methods but we didn't receive any email or notification. Because of this although we had 3 reservations for two couples and one single they only let us pay in two transactions which forced the couples to pay their part plus half of the single.

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,Gemma S wrote a review May 2016,50,The heart of the city üíú,"As a first time traveller to Morocco I did not really know what to expect... After a bit of research we decided we wanted to embrace the culture and atmosphere of the city rather than laze by a pool in a big hotel but were a little anxious of what we would find. It could not have been more wonderful. From the moment we were met from the taxi to being waved goodbye at the end of our stay we were made to feel so welcome and felt like we were visiting family.  The hotel itself is nestled away down narrow streets and as we are told like all Riads you could not expect what awaits behind the front door set on a stone wall. It opens up to the most beautiful home decorated so tastefully yet restored to its traditional former glory. We are shown to the serene courtyard where we are greeted by Patrick and served traditional mint tea and small delicious pastries. Patricks ethos is that you are a guest in his home and you are treat just like that by himself and all the staff. They really could not do enough for you and are so kind and helpful. Patrick advised us on what to see where to eat how to barter what price we should be paying as well as encouraging us to explore for ourselves. On an evening there is a security man who will escort you down the narrow paths to the hotel as it is not particularly lit and can be a bit daunting. There are a number of restaurants close by - I would recommend Cafe Arabe for its delicious food reasonably priced (2 courses and a bottle of wine approx ¬£35-45) and then up on terrace for drinks where the staff again are so lovely and good for some banter!  At the hotel we were served a feast of a breakfast on the terrace and sunbeds set up if we wanted to relax - which we did about an hour of!  You can get lost wandering around the Souks looking at all the jewellery spices scarves crockery... if you go far I would advise getting a taxi back for the sake of ¬£2-3. For 2 girls on our own it's not ideal to be without bearings after dark. You will be approached by everyone and of course will get the token ""nice girls I like"" comments and the henna ladies trying everything to get that henna on you! (""My gift to you"" does not mean free!!)  But on the whole everyone is so friendly and welcoming and there is so much to see! We only saw a fraction and cannot wait to return and discover the rest.  We visited Le Jardin Majorelle (designed by YSL) absolutely beautiful and a must see.  I have definitely found a new place in my heart.

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,Steve J wrote a review May 2016,50,Great hospitality - perfect for first visit to Marrakech,All the staff at the riad went above and beyond in making sure that our visit to Marrakech was great from the delicious breakfast on the patio giving directions and recommendations and coordinating transportation. They can also plan day excursions and we did a trip to the Atlas Mountains that was really unique. Without their help we would have been a bit lost in Marrakech. All in all they were just stellar people!    The riad is at the end of a winding set of streets and alleys in the Medina so it's removed from the noise on the street. Because it's more remote the riad and others on the street have actually pooled resources for a security guard that can escort you from the main street to the riad at night. That was great peace of mind.    It's a beautiful building as you can see from some other tripadvisor pics. It seems that typically riads are designed for the room windows to open up to the main building atrium rather than outside so the air got a little stuffy at times when we wanted to close the windows. That would be my only con about our experience though minimal and likely a design issue with other riads too.

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,bfoxy1 wrote a review Apr 2016,50,A trip back into time.,This Riad is located on long a narrow quiet street. As you open the large brass door entrance you slip back into centuries past. Beautiful tile and intricate iron work surround the courtyard. Actually this was once two separate residences until the owner Patrick and his wife blended the two into one extraordinary Riad. The section that we stayed had old wooden doors with ancient ironwork locks. The room was beautiful with a oversized tiled tub.  The help was amazing. I had a very bad cold during our stay and we had such a wonderful housekeeper who would bring me mint tea to the room. She was a very special person. She made me feel like this was my home and not merely a guest.  My only complaint and it is minor is that if there are noisy guests on the first floor the sound carries into the room.

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,Paul W wrote a review Mar 2016,50,"Great Riad to stay, great and helpful staff and owner. Awesome location","At the edge (or really just inside) the old town. Staff are super friendly and having breakfast at the top floor is a great start of the day. Patrick the owner takes a lot of time to help with your navigation in the old city. And if you are lost in the Medina just walk to the ""big square"" and follow the old city walls on the outside and you can't miss the place. Do drink the orange juice anywhere in the old city. It's the best I've ever had!    The first time it is a little tricky to find the place. Ask the cab driver to call the the Riad and they will tell the taxi where to wait and they will come pick you up to guide you through a few of the characteristic narrow ""streets"". Give them the full name because there is another Les Trois Palmiers far away from the old town they might otherwise be confused with. As a bonus the location is very close to a guarded palace so you actually have the advantage of lots of guards being around you when you return home to your hotel. The riad has a person stationed near the palace that will walk with you through the 3 narrow streets you need to take to prevent you getting lost (I have a special talent for losing my way so this was perfect for me. It also means you don't have to walk through the narrow streets in the dark all alone). I never felt unsafe and the owner Patrick even gave me his cellphone number in case I got lost. Also ask Patrick about the history of his riad.    I wouldn't consider staying elsewhere if I was going to return to Marrakesh.",Date of stay: March 2016,Trip type: Traveled solo,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y3065PXpaulw

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,melvaig wrote a review Jan 2016,50,Lovely Riad,Stayed here for 3 nights our room for 3 was on the ground floor and was spacious and very clean. It's about a 10 - 15 minute walk to the square and we did get lost a few times but just added to the fun in Marrakech. This is the third Riad we have stayed in and this is the one we will definitely return to. Patrick (owner) and the staff were all so helpful and friendly and nothing was too much trouble. Highly recommend the cookery class very enjoyable you get taken to the market to buy the ingredients for the dishes then you get shown how to cook you then are served on the terrace with your dishes for lunch.

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,AMD-BCN wrote a review Jan 2016,40,Good option to stay in Marrakech,We spent 3 nights in Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha. Starting with the positive opinion: the staff and the guy running it Patrick made all the efforts to make our stay very confortable. The Riad is very nicely decorated. We stayed in two different rooms. The first room on the roof terrace was very small dark and claustrophobic. Fortunately Patrick upgraded us and changed us after I complained to a much nicer room located on the 1st floor. This one was stunning: large very nice bathroom with a huge bath nicely decorated. What was a bad experience when we arrived because we were accommodated in the tiny room it changed from the second day.  We had dinner in the Riad and it was excellent. Highly recommended.  A con: the Riad is not easily found in the Medina and transport arranged by the Riad is strongly recommended. The transfer to the airport for 10 euros is highly recommended.  In summary: a very good option to stay in Marrakech. Make sure you choose the right bedroom in the Riad since it seems it has two different types the small ones are not confortable at all. In contrast the large ones are extremely nice.  Very positive: the staff who made all the efforts to make us a very pleasant nice stay.,Date of stay: December 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Barcelona, Spain",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AMD-BCN

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,JessyeHerrell wrote a review Oct 2015,50,A stay in paradise!,We had a truly fantastic stay at Riad Les Trois Palmiers last week!    First of all this Riad is in the perfect location - it's a 5-30 minute walk from everything we wanted to see including sights in the Medina and Ville Nouvelle.    The Riad's driver Ali was prompt clear and friendly when he met us at the airport. He gave us our first mini-tour from the car on the drive to the Medina.    When we pulled up at Dar El Bacha we met Deeba (a complete angel) who helped us with our bags and showed us the way to the Riad. This was absolutely 100% necessary as it's tucked away (and hence very quiet). Deeba served us some tasty Moroccan mint tea and pastries upon our arrival and then brought us to our room.    Our room was on the terrace which was BEAUTIFUL and has a 360 degree view of the Medina and Atlas Mountains. Our room was perfectly comfortable and immaculate. There was a small closet night stands with outlets and a safe (which we weren't expecting but appreciated). There were plush robes in the bathroom and our fluffy towels were replaced daily.    Patrick was unavailable (which I hear is rare!) around the time of our first adventure outside the Riad we were oriented by Youness who gave us a couple maps and very clear directions on how to get to/from Jma El Fnaa (about a 15 minute walk) as well as a few other highlights nearby. Youness is a delight - incredibly friendly and a super hard worker. We saw him the most out of any staff member because he was around in the evening and he really made our stay wonderful.    We highly HIGHLY recommend the half-board - we ate in the Riad every night of our one week stay. Dalila's cuisine is out of this world. Each night we wished we had more room in our tummies for her delicious 5-course (!) meals. Breakfast is killer too. Khaled served us a breakfast of homemade yogurt fresh OJ and a variety of fruits spreads pastries and hot beverages every morning with a big smile.    We booked a handful of activities while in Marrakech:    -Half-day walking tour with Moustafa. Moustafa was excellent. He brought us all around the Medina (Jma El Fnaa The Bahia Palace Ben Yousef Medersa the Mellah and the souks) and shared a wealth of information with us. Sightseeing on our own wouldn't have been nearly as informative or enjoyable. It also really helped us to get our bearings doing this on the first day of our visit.    -Hot Air Balloon ride at sunrise - totally worth getting up at 5:00AM. This doesn't need much explanation (just a heads up that you pay the operator in cash not the Riad).    - Moroccan cooking class - definitely do this if you can. Before the class the very kind Youssef brought us on a grocery shopping trip around the Medina. Patrick follows up with recipes so you can keep it up at home and you'll never have been so proud of yourself in the kitchen.    Finally Patrick and Caroline's hospitality goes above and beyond any hosts we've had before. The personal attention and warm welcome they give each guest stands out and you leave feeling like part of the family. The entire staff of the Riad is warm kind and ready to help you with any request.    We can't recommend Les Trois Palmiers enough - you'd be a fool not to stay here!    Thank you a million times! We hope to come back again someday!  Scott & Jessye,Date of stay: October 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Brooklyn, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JessyeHerrell
Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,lyns_rayner wrote a review Oct 2015,50,Phenomenal start and finish to a week away.,On my recent visit to Morocco as a group of 10 we travelled from Marrakech to the Sahara and back. Riad Les Trois Palmiers was both out first and last stop of the trip setting standards for the week very high.    Upon arrival all the staff were incredibly welcoming and accommodating including the owners - Patrick and Caroline - who were always on hand for advice and guidance being extremely helpful.    The Raid itself featured some amazing decor with free wifi in communal areas. The luxurious rooms were all well maintained and kept clean throughout both of our stays. Once again they were beautifully decorated with air con and even the luxury of bath robes at no extra cost!    The whole atmosphere of the Riad was chilled peaceful and safe - out of the main rush of the city a perfect place to retreat to after a day in Jemaa-El-Fnaa and he souks.    Breakfast here was possibly one of my favourites of the whole trip - with the most delicious yoghurt recipe and freshly squeezed orange juice every morning. On our final night we ate our evening meal at the Riad too which was again a devine selection of food. There was so much to eat bringing out course after course. It seemed never ending! Again the waiter and chefs remained lovely throughout and we're all up for a good laugh with out crazy group!

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,Allysev wrote a review Aug 2015,50,STUNNING! : LOOK NO FURTHER.....,"It took me two whole days to decide upon where to stay in Marrakech as there are sooo many hotels and riads...  I finally decided on Les Trois Palmiers and my goodness how right I was!  The actual riad is absolutely stunning decorated in the best of tastes with two beautiful pools and many sitting rooms where one can always find a private corner.  Our room was beautiful one of the best rooms we have ever stayed in......I mean including rooms in very expensive hotels!  The whole riad was spotlessly clean cleaner than a ""normal hotel"" which fact contributed to the comfort of our stay....even the bed linen was what one would expect in a far superior (meaning much more expensive) establishment!  But what actually made our holiday so great and unforgettable was the staff! How attentive and kind they are making us feel really ""at home"".....we did not even lock our room on going out which says it all.  Dalila the main cook fed us no I shall be vulgar and say: ""stuffed us"" on the most wonderful food we could have expected. We actually had to beg her not to cook any more for us (we chose half board after sampling dinner the first night).  We shall definitely be returning hopefully with friends and family.

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,Sam E wrote a review Jul 2015,50,Beautiful riad amongst the madness!,My friend and I stayed at this Riad for a long weekend. We were met at the airport by their driver Ali who also drove us on a trip to the Altas Mountains he was very friendly and informative. When we got as far as the taxi could go we were met by the wonderful Eunice and let to the Riad which was not far at all. Dinner was ready for us and was lovely although far too much for us to eat it all! An added bonus was that we had been given an upgrade our room was beautiful and felt very traditional. The breakfast the following morning was fantastic with homemade pancakes perfectly ripe fruit and the most delicious homemade yogurt I've ever tasted! Along with other breads pastries and freshly squeezed orange juice. The 3.15am Call to Prayer was not always very welcome but all part if the experience! We had arranged a trip to the Atlas Mountains through the Riad which was great. It was a welcome change to get out of the city heat and our guide Mohamed was excellent... I would definitely recommend doing the trip the only very slight negative was that the lunch was included was not brilliant but sometimes that's to be expected on day trips and was still very good value for money.  I would definitely recommend this Riad it is beautiful and peaceful yet not far at all from the madness of the Soukes and the main square...

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,Adam C wrote a review Jun 2015,30,Pleasant Riad close to the heart of the Medina,A 3 star rating seems a little harsh as overall the hotel was pleasant and the staff were generally helpful however there were a few points that deserve a mention.    1) On our arrival night we were shown to a very small room on the roof terrace we knew this to be an error as we had specifically booked the large room when we finally got onto the internet to confirm our booking the staff were unwilling to move us as their system did not reflect this. The larger room was empty and we had provided evidence of our booking. We did finally get moved to the room we had booked but it took an hour of arguing.    2) The breakfast is a very basic traditional Moroccan affair with pastries fruit and yoghurt. Whilst this is perfectly acceptable the service of it wasn't indeed there was one day that after waiting 30 minutes we were presented with one croissant and an over ripe banana. When we complained it was rapidly put right with lots of apologies however it doesn't change the fact that it took them 30 minutes to deliver a croissant and a banana (we did remind them many times)    3) The rooms are nicely appointed and typically Moroccan however our room was in the middle of the Riad on the ground floor and it could probably be more properly described as a corridor with a bed at one end and 30cm of floor space either side of the bed. The room was also very dark.    The plus points of this hotel are its location about 5 minutes from the Main square and the roof top terrace with its superb views.    With an improvement in the check in procedure especially when dealing with problems and and improvement in breakfast offering and service I would probably justify a four circle rating.,Date of stay: April 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Leeds, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Adam1630
Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,FredSparkes wrote a review Jun 2015,50,Impossible to find anything wrong,This really is a hidden gem.  Behind an insignificant door in a wall in a maze of passages but not difficult to find when you know the way lies a real treasure. Les Trois Palmiers is one of two merchants houses converted into one unit each consisting of a ground floor with plunge pool deep and refreshingly cold and various spaces to relax in. there is a mezzanine with bedrooms around it and above this a roof terrace with sunbeds and another room. our room was on the mezzanine and was cool and quiet with an air conditioning unit we never needed to use despite outside temperatures well into the 30s there was also a safe. The bed was perfect and the d√©cor was also sumptuous. the en-suite unit was also excellent with toiletries and a hair dryer provided.  The staff kept the Riad in beautiful condition and the whole place was decorated with examples of Moroccan artefacts and ample seating with reading matter and a TV/DVD player also provided.  The breakfast included in the price was also high standard more than just a continental breakfast including bread croissants pain chocolat local items fresh fruit and coffee or English tea. Mint tea was available throughout the day.  The evening meal available on request at an reasonable price was an authentic local meal cooked and served by the staff.  The staff could not do enough for us and were extremely caring  one of our group was unwell one day and stayed in her room and the staff checked on her throughout the day bringing mint tea and sweetmeats and yoghurt.  Monsieur Patrick the owner could not do enough for us either and arranged for his driver to collect us and our luggage from our previous accommodation and transport us to the airport at the end of our stay. His stated aim to make us like part of the family during our stay was achieved perfectly.

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,Paula E wrote a review Jun 2015,50,Palacial sorroundings and a staff fit for a king!,This riad was recommended to me by a classmate in my Summer in Spain law school program. I'm so glad I asked someone who had just been to Marrakech. I booked the riad the day before my trip and was a little nervous since I did not hear directly from the riad regarding my taxi pick up time from the airport which is included in your rate. Be that as it may the driver was waiting for me in the airport with a sign which was a huge relief. The taxis cannot go into the part of the city where the riad is located so I was handed off to Enuss the host/receptionist who welcomed me and walked me to the riad. I cannot say enough about this man and his graciousness wealth of knowlege and accomodating demeanor. Another employee who's name eludes me serves breakfast in the morning where ever you wish to take it. Homemade yogurt is served everyday and I've never tasted anything like it. You basically will have your own private outdoor dining area depending on which floor you're on. Make sure to go up to the roof around sunset the view is stunning and you can see the entire city. Patrick the owner drew a map for me the next day and explained the history of the riad and some don't miss attractions. You will be just a 10 minute walk from the main square. If you come back after dark a nice man named Omar will meet you in the main street and escort you back through the labyrinth of walled in streets and alert the receptionist that you are back. This is like stepping back into another time even though the wifi is better than any in Europe where I've stayed this summer.

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,MarieFl wrote a review Jun 2015,50,"Absolutely delightful, very charming Riad",I can't praise this lovely Riad highly enough. It was spotlessly clean tastefully appointed and simply beautiful. The owner Patrick and concierge Khalid give this very special place it's unique charm. I highly recommend the practical airport pickup service. The elegant and very dignified Khalid drew us a map from the Riad to Jemaa el Fna plaza which allowed us to navigate the medina with very little trouble. Pay no attention to the cheeky teenagers who delight in pointing you the wrong way -- just stick to Khalid's map. The Riad is perfectly located for all the main sights yet is hidden away in a perfectly quiet location that is absolutely relaxing and simply beautiful. The rooftop terrace was an added feature that we thoroughly enjoyed. I had dinner every evening in the Riad and chef Dalila outdid herself every time with wonderfully delicious dishes especially the typical vegetarian starters made with some form of aubergine. I would definitely stay here again and recommend it without hesitation. In fact just writing this review makes me yearn to go back soon.

The medina especially in and around the square is all noisy hustle and bustle so being a little away turned out to be quite perfect. Les Trois Palmiers (which is actually two raids joined together) is located down a dead-end alley off the street with only riads and private residents as immediate neighbours ensuring it was a peaceful retreat. From the street there was quick access to taxis in one direction and souks in the other which was very convenient and being a single female traveller having a private security guard throughout the night to provide escort to your door a bonus.  The owners have created a sophisticated environment with a quiet and friendly ambiance. All the staff especially Khalid and Unais were efficient and considerate and thought to offer before I had a chance to ask!  Breakfasts were lovely served wherever you choose; I found the roof terrace quite perfect in the cooler morning air.  Other little touches like fresh roses in my room homemade pastries on arrival chilled music in the courtyard and personalised advice on Marrakech made this a much nicer stay than I imagined before arriving.,Date of stay: May 2015,Trip type: Traveled solo,Perth,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Christine_Aust

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,Daniel M wrote a review Apr 2015,50,A great introduction to morocco,We booked after reading a review stating 'an oasis of calm'... So true. Lovely room peaceful roof terrace and staff that couldn't be more helpful. They helped with every aspect with a smile regardless of how many questions we asked. The hand drawn street map was a saviour. When we had a minor mistake the staff and owner went above and beyond to make things right. We would book again and highly recommend it!!!,Date of stay: April 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G3834COdanielm
Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,Angel2273 wrote a review Mar 2015,50,Delightful Riad hidden away in the medina.,The riad is an oasis of calm in the midst of the bustling medina area. The design and decor are lovely - each room has it's own character. We stayed in the Saadienne Suite which has a huge bath tub that you have to climb into! The doors creak a bit and the wi-fi reception is a bit erratic but it all adds to the charm!  The central courtyard is a comfortable place to relax in at any time and we were served a wonderful evening meal there which we had pre-ordered for the first night of our stay - this was all beautifully prepared and cooked by the resident chef and the chicken tagine was the best we had during our stay in Marrakech. The rooftop terrace is perfect for relaxing when the weather is warm and it was a great start to the day having the delicious breakfast served there whilst listening to the birdsong and sounds of the city.  It's definitely worth booking the return airport transfer which is currently included in the cost if you stay for 4 nights or more then you don't have to haggle with local taxi drivers and you are escorted from the drop off area to the riad by their staff. (Cars can't enter the central medina area). We also pre-booked a day trip to the Atlas mountains which was organised via the riad and had a wonderful day out allowing us to see the surrounding countryside.  Patrick (the owner) and his staff are very welcoming - they treated us more like family than paying guests! We really felt as though they cared that we enjoyed our stay - taking the trouble to give us detailed directions to various areas that we wanted to visit in the city and giving advice to us about local customs and traditions.  It was a very memorable stay - thank you to Patrick Khalid and Yussef and to Ali the driver.,Date of stay: March 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Angel2273

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,Red_Three wrote a review Mar 2015,50,Hidden Gem,My holiday in Marrakech was organised by my other half and her decision to book this Riad was one of her best by far. We were collected from the airport by a driver pre arranged by the Riad- which bypasses the whole hassle of haggling with taxi driver to get to the medina.    I must admit - was a little concerned at first having to navigate down various back alleys to get to the Riad but once inside was amazed at how spacious/ bright and stylish the riad was. Just to mention that although it is a little disconcerting at first to navigate these alleyways- we never felt any danger at all and it was perfectly safe.    The Riad is divided into 2 separate buildings with a large open central courtyard in both one of them has the aforementioned 3 palm trees which gives rise to its name. There are some very picturesque pools in each courtyard- probably suitable for bathing only. The roof is dotted with sofa's and little enclaves - perfect for sunbathing and relaxing when the weather is good.    We booked the Sardienne suite- which was equipped with a small flatscreen + dvd player and satellite channels (mainly continental you do get sky news in english though). The highlight is the bathroom which has a very luxurious mosaic tiled bath tub big enough probably for 4-5 ppl. Just a small tip- you may have to ask the staff when the best time to attempt a bath might be- as the hot water will run out way before you are close to filling the tub.    The Riad has a good on site cook and they are happy to take requests prices are good value for money and was just as good as any of the local restaurants. They also serve alcohol and prices are keeping with local bars. since we were only one of 2/3 sets of guests staying there we definitely felt well attended to Staff are very friendly.    Wifi is free a big plus but is very erratic with the connection. The best places to get connections are in the courtyard unfortunately getting wifi in our room was hit and miss.    Breakfast is standard continental pastries/ bread juice with tea/ coffee. A freshly made flat bread. You can request an omelette which some guests were not aware of.    Patrick who runs the Riad is an excellent source of local knowledge and gave us some good recommendations for local bars/ restaurants.    I'd wholeheartedly recommend this Riad to friends.,Date of stay: March 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Windsor, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Red_Three

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,Lynsey wrote a review Mar 2015,50,"Romantic Riad, can't grumble.",I'm a little late posting this review but better late than never. I stayed at this beautiful Riad in Feb 2013 for my boyfriends birthday. I like to take him somewhere different every year but this was just beyond perfection. I booked 3 nights at the Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha however it wasn't until a few weeks later I realised the terrible mistake I had made. I had only gone and booked a hotel with a similar name downtown which had awful reviews. It wasn't until I had emailed Patrick the owner of the Les Trois Palmiers who alerted me to my mistake and told me I had booked the wrong hotel. I was quickly able to correct my mistake and reserve the nights I wanted thankfully in the right Riad.    I emailed Patrick who very kindly sent a driver to collect us from the airport. Although our driver was stuck in traffic and running late Patrick reassured us that he was on his way and that we hadn't been forgotten. We were driven to the centre of Marrakesh where we then pulled over and our luggage was transferred onto a little wooden cart and we were escorted by 2 local men down some very narrow alleyways. So narrow that you had to bend down so that you didn't hit your head on the roof. Thankfully without the help of these locals we would not have found this Riad that was hidden away. We stopped at a large wooden door down one of these alleys. I could not begin to imagine what was behind it and even if we had come to the right place. I was preparing myself for an utter nightmare and was beginning to think I had been scammed. But to my amazement when the door opened it revealed an absolute piece of paradise. A stunning Moroccan Riad surrounded by Palm trees pools stunning decor and friendly faces. I was gobsmacked. Even my partner did not say a word and that is a first. You would not believe that this Riad is located only a 5 min walk away from the main square.    We were greeted by Patrick the owner who welcomed us to his Riad and gave us a cup on mint tea. We had a little natter and then were shown up to our room 'Iddrisside' which was on the roof!! A stunning little room on the roof of this Riad decorated perfectly surrounded by flowers and a view over the entire city. Patrick took us up some steps which led to a sun trap. We were able to lounge out on the sun lounger. Although it was still quite breezy this time of year the sun was still shining. Patrick pointed out the Mosques and explained the call to prayer. It was fascinating to listen to and from all angles.    We had a wonderful nights sleep. Did not hear a sound apart from the call to prayer which starts very early in the morning but if you can't cope with this then don't go to Morrocco. Breakfast was an absolute delight. So much so that we actually looked forward to it in the morning. Staff came in with fresh breads from the local bakeries home made yogurt was absolutely delishious fresh orange juice just wonderful. Birds singing and tweeting and flying around the palm trees.    As it was my boyfriends birthday we were looking for an activity to do. Patrick recommended some quad biking. He even phoned up and organised it for us. We were collected from our Riad and returned again later on. Fantastic!    I had booked a three night stay and then had plans to check out for two nights in order to go on a 3 day tour around Morocco and then booked a further 2 nights here on our return back to Marrakesh. The lovely owner Patrick allowed us to leave our luggage here during the 3 days we were gone so that we didn't have to drag our suitcases around with us in the 4x4.    On our return and to our suprise Patrick had put us in an upgraded room 'Almohade' for the same price. Absolutely stunning room. You have to open a tiny wooden door and bend down to go in. The whole stay here was absolutely fantastic. I can't fault it. Even when we wanted to sit in after a long walk around the Medina we could just sit and relax anywhere in the Riad. It was so quiet and peaceful and staff were always asking if there was anything we need.    We ate dinner here on one night. It was a tagine of some sort of sausage. I have to say I was not a massive fan but that is just down to personal taste. The staff even offered to cook me something else because I did not eat it.    On our departure Patrick gave me a lovely bracelet made from Orange rope. Stunning. A really lovely touch. I definitely miss this Riad and I would return again should I ever go back to Marrakesh. I would without a doubt recommend this Riad to family and friends but at the same time I hope it does not become too popular else the price will go up for our return.    Thank you Patrick for a really wonderful memorable and unforgettable stay.

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,Regsport wrote a review Feb 2015,50,Authentic riad with committed staff,There is an air of calm and relaxation about this space which provides a welcome retreat from the hassle and mania which can be experienced in Marrakesh. The roof terrace which looks out over the city is spellbinding on a sunny day.    It's actually two 300 year old riads knocked together and lovingly renovated by the French owner Patrick and his wife. As it's tucked away down a labyrinth of alleyways which are inaccessible to vehicles donkeys had to be used to transport building materials over the 18 month period it took for the renovation. On first arrival it is almost impossible to find without the help of someone with local knowledge so be prepared to pay a Marrakshi for guidance. Once you've got your bearings it's a 10 minute stroll through the souk to the Jemaa El Fna.    Breakfast is substantial omelette on request freshly squeezed orange juice Moroccan pastries with the deliciously creamy home made yoghurt the star attraction. The real star turns in the riad though are the effusively attentive staff Khaled in the daytime and Yusuf the night porter who will make you as much mint tea as you can drink and ensure you have a heater to keep you warm in the chilly wintertime.    The place is traditionally decorated with three real palm trees the centre piece. Bedrooms are large and comfortable - there was a slight smell of drains in our bathroom but that was a small price to pay for the privilege of staying in such a fascinating authentic well located riad.,Date of stay: January 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Purfleet, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Regsport
Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,Vildo wrote a review Jan 2015,20,Can't see where....,"...All these good reviews came from. Seems that majority of clients were pleased so we may have had the one of not great time.    Due to weather in the mountains we got stuck in Marrakech for another night and I only booked this place at about 7.30 pm once we failed to cross the mountains and returned to Marrakech... using an app on my phone. When we arrived to the Riad maybe 30 mins after the booking they didn't seem to have any idea. Which is partially fair enough maybe didn't check their emails every 30 mins so no trouble. We were sat and asked to wait till the receptionist guy manages to get hold of the owner to see which room we can have. (I thought I booked a specific twin room so I fail to understand why this suddenly needed clarifying. It was on my confirmation email as well.) As this clarification was taking quite a while we were offered tea & biscuits which was good. After some pacing around the floors by the receptionist we eventually got into the room at about 9 pm. It was fairly simple and nice room no thrill but absolutely fine. We however noticed a strange smell as if from blocked drain or something similar. Air con needed to be on ""heating"" setting as it wasn't exactly warm in the room and it was like having a dying tractor in the room with you. Despite having an extension wifi router right next to my head/pillow I could never connect to it. I had to leave the room to get wifi reception from the original router (not extension one). This worked ok in the evening didn't work at all next morning. When having a shower in the morning there wasn't too much warm water left it seemed and the drain looked blocked I stood in a puddle way above my ankles. There was an ""industrial"" padlock on our door that we weren't given keys to so couldn't lock our room at any point. Breakfast in morning was more food than I've had in an another Riad we stayed at. Couldn't not notice that the receptionist always wore his puffy winter coat indicating how warm it was in this area.    On the overall we paid just under 50 euros for the night which isn't expensive. But compared to the Riad we staid at the other nights where we also spent 50 euros a night this didn't look like a good deal at all. See my other review to compare these two Riads.    Forgot to mention that it wasn't too easy to find this Riad which however isn't anything unusual. You more less struggle to find anything in Marrakech. There was a security guard who always walked you from the main road to the Riad door which was nice but the need of a security guy indicates certain things.    But as I said there must be something good about this Riad as it wouldn't have got so many good reviews. We just possibly didn't seem to have that luck to experience the same.

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,TastyTemptress wrote a review Jan 2015,50,Beautiful authentic Riad with lovely owner and staff!,"I stayed at the Riad Les Trois Palmiers for two nights with my boyfriend in January.  We had the ""Alaouite"" double bedroom with a beautiful mosaic tiled bathroom and big window opening up to the courtyard. The room has a traditional Moroccan d√©cor is spacious and very clean. In the evening it could get quite cold but we had a plug in fan heater in the room so it was never a problem.  The French owner and staff at the Riad are all extremely helpful and accommodating.  They all speak excellent English as well as French.  Service is always delivered with a smile!    The location is not bad but you have to walk down a few back alleys to get there. HOWEVER they did have a security guard who walked us from the road to the Riad ever night shining his torch and making sure we were safe and got in properly. (he didn't want money just a great service they provided to make us tourists feel more comfortable)    One possible negative would be that you don't get a key to the front door but that seem pretty standard for Riads in Morocco...  We had to knock on the door or phone up the reception to be let in which if you arrive late can feel a bit uncomfortable. But as mentioned we always had the guard waiting with us to make sure we got in ok.    The Breakfast is lovely with Fresh orange juice traditional Moroccan crepes bread jams Vache Qui Rit cheese pastries and choice of eggs (we had omelet)    Internet was high speed in communal areas but a bit slower in our room.    As it was quite cold and cloudy during our stay we didn't get to enjoy the sun terrace but it looked lovely!    All in all we were very happy with our stay at Riad Les Trois Palmier. This Riad is finished to an extremely high standard with very authentic and high quality furnitures and fittings. The service is exceptional and we were very grateful for all the advice pick up from the airport and drop off at the bus station all free of charge.

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,mzhope wrote a review Dec 2014,50,A delightful Riad with excellent staff and charming host,I began my trip to Morocco in Marrakech. I traveled from Madrid with an old school friend so we were to share a room but with 2 single beds. We were met at the airport by Ali and escorted from the drop off just outside the city walls by Yussef to this most delightful Riad. The room was perfect and so beautifully appointed. The next day we met our charming host Patrick who not only provided us with recommendations for Marrakech but also organized our five day trip into the desert. We discussed at length with Patrick what we wanted to see what kind of travelers we are and what our interests were. Together with Ali Patrick put together a perfect itinerary for us that was well beyond what we could have hoped for. Ali was a TERRIFIC guide and travel companion. Discovering the Morocco Ali showed us was the highlight of our trip. Ali spoke Spanish with my friend English and French with me. Ali went out of his way to accommodate our every interest and easily went with the flow when we changed our minds which was often. My friend is a photographer and I I am very interested in meeting folks and chatting and getting a glimpse of how every day people live. We also love coffee :) and Ali went out of his way to stop at some great spots so we could just watch the world go by. I highly recommend Patrick's Riad Les Trois Palmieres and a trip with Ali.,Date of stay: December 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Toronto, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mzhope
Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,hira s wrote a review Dec 2014,30,Average,Stayed at this hotel from 16th dec to 20th. was a good hotel but nothing what like I expected located in a good area. Walking distance to markets etc but wouldn't class this as a 5 star property it was clean and safe to stay in but nothing really special the pools were not in use as the water was freezing breakfast was simple just hot drinks and bread rolls. Me and the misses stayed in the sardine room which was Suspose to be the best room in the riad it was nice but cold after the 1st night we had to change rooms because there was a water issue but we went to a similar room and was charged a lower rate which was a good thing. The staff in the riad was really good anything you need day or night they will help as much as possible. Take a phone and torch with you hard to find during the night. Had 1 bad issue with the riad around 12 45 at night some other couple was staying at the riad as they arrived back to it the night porter was either sleeping or didn't hear the door but I did and I was a at the top floor they was banging for 15 mins until they woke me up and then i opened the door for them wouldn't class this holiday for a lads more of a family holiday was really expensive out there like ¬£3.50 for a small beer on average if you are going for a meal it's going to work out ¬£50 for two. weather was good t shirt and jeans was hot around 22 degrees.I expected more from this riad from reading the other reviews overall was an ok place to stay,Date of stay: December 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Bristol, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hiras_13

You will receive a very warm welcome from Patrick and the staff will bend over backwards to give you everything you need for your stay.    The Riad itself was refurbished a few years ago by the owners very tastefully- the bedrooms situated around two courtyards each with a plunge pool.    The area in which the Riad is situated is perfect for a long weekend in Marrakesh - it's 15 minutes walk to the main square and is right next to the souqs and for anything else its 5 minute walk to a taxi rank.    Our group had two bedrooms on the lovely roof terrace which we had all to ourselves and where we had a very nice breakfast every morning - thanks to the guys for bringing it up so many flights of stairs to us.    There were just a few niggles. The rooms are very small and the beds not that comfy- and they all look like they could do with a bit of updating. Also we had dinner here one night - there was no red wine available the food was average and the tagine served was cold and dry.    So overall a pleasant but not perfect stay.,Date of stay: September 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,Brighton,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/neilc27
Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,CRR wrote a review Aug 2014,50,Perfect stay!,My very first trip to Marrakesh and so happy we stayed here. The riad itself was stunning with lots of character and the staff were absolutely amazing. so attentive and friendly!    We were picked up at the airport however our driver arrived late which left us a bit panicked as had no idea how to direct taxi if we needed one. The driver turned up and all was ok in the end. The raid is located through some dark lanes which we thought at first would be tricky to navigate and scary to walk through but we felt very safe and after a few trips knew the route like the back of our hands. We had the room at the bottom of the riad off the court and it was perfect for 3 people as we wanted to have our own beds due it being far too hot too share and it was a good size with a large bathroom and all the things e needed to help get ready daily. The only thing is you could hear the noise of the people speaking outside the room but this didn‚Äôt bother us as we were pretty chilled out. The rooftop was perfect fro topping up our tan and when it got too hot we laid in the shaded room on the roof top.    Breakfast was yummy. Pastries and home made yoghurt which was delicious!! I would recommend the Berber eggs which is an omelette style tagine egg with tomatoes onions and spices YUM!!!    The staff were helpful and gave us advice on where to go and directions and just made you feel at home. We would definitely go back to this riad and highly recommend it.,Date of stay: July 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CRR341

The location could not be better right at the edge of the busy Medina streets and only a short walk from the souks main square and attractions! I would highly recommend this riad and its 'cuisine' without any hesitation to everyone especially when travelling with children (you can even borrow the owner's stroller)!!,Date of stay: December 2013,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Curious_Katja
Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,John B wrote a review Apr 2014,50,Great stay,We had a great weeks stay at this beautiful Riad. After being collected from the airport we were welcomed by the very friendly staff who gave us some mint tea and pastries before being shown around by Pat the owner. He described and showed pictures of the history of the Riad which he is rightfully very proud of.    Pat was always willing to help with very useful hand drawn maps of the medina advice on where to eat and the numerous excursions he provides. We went to the foothills of the Atlas Mountains and had a great day out. We also ate twice at the riad the food was excellent and plentiful with the price being extremely reasonable.    The most memorable thing though was the peace and quiet the Riad provided. This is really needed after a day in the medina. The sun terrace was great for sunbathing and also for breakfast and lunch in the sun. A really great stay!

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,Richard L wrote a review Apr 2014,10,I loved this place but hated the driver,"I had to think about this post a few times before I actually decided to sit down to write it.    I requested a pick up as I had a very short trip and didn't want to waste time getting to the Medina. I was surprised when I presented myself to the driver and he just turned around and started walking away. I didn't need any help with my bag and would have said no but the least I expected was an offer. When we got to his taxi he started shouting with someone else (for about 15 minutes) and I obviously couldn't understand him but he was ""fighting"" with someone who should have cleaned the car. I didn't think this was very professional as I was just sitting there watching this. When I arrived at the Riad I was so impressed that I totally forgot this bad experience.    Patrick the owner is a GREAT host and very kindly gave me great tips and suggestions and sat patiently with me drawing a map for me to know what to do.    I decided to take the cooking lessons and Samira and Dalila where fantastic teachers and a pleasure to be with. All the staff was very kind and always helpful. I was having a fantastic experience.    But then again when I had to return to the airport the last day I was accompanied by on of the staff to the taxi and my things were placed in the car and I sat down and the driver is talking to the hotel staff. A couple of minute later he gets in the car and starts complaining to me that the ride to the airport costs at least 100 dirham (just short of 10 euros) and that the staff had just given him 60 and that I had to pay the difference. I had actually paid 15 euros in other words at least 50% more than what he wanted and therefore wasn't going to give him one cent but all I said was I had already paid at the Riad and he would have to settle that with Patrick. All upset he starts driving away and then all of a sudden stops the car in the middle of the street close to another taxi get out and talks to the other driver and comes back to the car and says ""get out he is going to take you"". I was really upset and if I didn't have a flight would probably have wanted to go back to the Riad to clear this mess up but I just checked with the other driver that I wasn't going to pay anything as I had already paid and he said ok and turned on the meter. I was actually shocked because when I go to the airport the meter was at 32 dirhams...    I wrote to the Riad and have waited for 5 days and received no reply and thus and making this bad review. I am sure that Patrick will change the driver so please check this if you do book the transfer. But except for that I had a fantastic experience at the Riad and strongly recommend it to all.",Date of stay: April 2014,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Rio de Janeiro, RJ",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RichardL318

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,Jayellbee wrote a review Mar 2014,40,A touch of calm in frantic Marrakech,I booked for a large group to stay for 3 nights via email with Patrick the proprietor and all my subsequent requests for information etc were replied to very quickly and efficiently. I believe all guests have an included pick-up at the airport which is necessary as otherwise you would not find this riad in the maze of small alleyways. Don't be daunted by this it is part of the character of Marrakech but I would suggest taking photos of the turns as you first arrive so that when you head out on your own you can find your way back.    When we arrived at the airport we were stuck in passport control queues for 2 hours which was miserable but fortunately our drivers waited for us. When we arrived at the riad we were greeted with mint tea and small pastries served in one of the lovely courtyard areas - a nice touch.    All of our rooms were fine some a bit larger than others. If you want to have a bit more space it is worth doing an upgrade to one of the larger rooms. Some other guests have commented about the drains - I agree a bit about this but you are in the middle of a very old part of the city and a certain amount of this sort of thing must be expected. Similarly other reviews mention the prayer calls from the mosques - we were aware of this but it wasn't something that spoiled our stay - if that sort of thing bothers you then remember your ear plugs or stay in the modern city.    Make sure that you explore the riad fully - there are little sitting areas tucked away around the riad and the roof area is wonderful all different levels and areas from which to look over the city or just sit and relax.    The staff are very nice and helpful breakfast was good and all in all we had a great stay. They do serve a limited selection of alcohol if you are that way inclined most restaurants etc in the city do not.

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,TAReviewer100 wrote a review Mar 2014,20,You can do better!,There are three main pitfalls to this Riad. The first is that there is no separation between the shower toilet and sink in the bathroom. Furthermore the drain in the bathroom was clogged and the water wouldn't drain which then overflowed into the rest of the room. Second after booking the Riad I received an email saying please pay in cash. I then responded and asked if they would take my credit card (considering I booked the reservation with the credit card) and they said that would be fine. However when I checked out they wouldn't take a credit card and I ended up having to pay cash. Given that I specifically asked if they would take a credit card I found this unreasonable and inconvienient. Lastly for the price you can find a much better Riad in the same area.,Date of stay: March 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Chicago, Illinois",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TAReviewer100

They make sure you don't need anything are very helpful and so kind. The location is perfect very close to couple of restaurants street animation and shops and walking distance from the center of the Medina and souck.

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,Louise A wrote a review Feb 2014,40,Full of character,Let's start by saying that this is Marrakech. Things aren't always going to go smoothly. But that being the case what you want is a Riad where the staff can't do enough to help and whose main aim is to make sure you have the best stay you can. This is what you will get here and the riad has been restored with oodles of charm and character. If you want to stay somewhere with no character and where little breakdowns or power short circuits don't happen from time to time then book a big expensive chain and have an unreal experience. Nothing is too much trouble for these guys. They will make you feel at home.    The breakfasts are plentiful and delicious. The main evening meal will feed about 3 people (rather than 1) with serveral courses and is fantastic meals served wherever you desire. But bear in mind if you do the cookery course you will likely learn how to make what you ate the night before so I suggest you choose to do one or the other to avoid eating the same thing twice.  The double room was small but for one person just perfect and I always holiday on the principle that the room is really just somewhere to sleep between explorations. That said as a single female traveller who will be up and out early exploring and tucked up in my room safe at night what is really important to me is internet in the room (which is what this riad advertises) so that I can report back home that I am safe and well and keep in touch in my own relaxed space. Sadly this is not the case here. My room was on the top floor (also very cold at this time of year so maybe ask to be lower if you are visiting off-season) and there was no internet there. So I would have to come all the way down to the lounge to use it (once in my pyjamas!) and even then it was intermittent. Given I made my booking choice partly based on knowing there is internet in the rooms I don't think this riad should be advertising that they have it as they know they don't. You may be luckier in lower rooms. On the flip side I felt so at home that I didn't really care about sitting around in my pyjamas (no I'm not a total weirdo) but you really will feel at home here and there are lots of nooks and crannies to hide away in downstairs.    The location is great. Half way between the souks to the east and the bus station to the west (10 mins walk approx each in a straight line). And Hammam de la Rose right around the corner which I shall review separately (DO IT!) as well as the bus to Essaouira.    DO get picked up from the airport as said before re finding this place initially) and DO take a compass (on your phone?) to save you walking miles in the wrong direction when you emerge from the souks with no concept of where you are. Maps won't help and you'll likely have to pay for directions which may or may not be correct. Don't expect landmarks or road signs to help you either.    All in all a lovely Riad and an interesting visit to Marrakech but I can't give 5* due to the misadvertising. If accommodation says internet in the rooms I expect that to mean ALL rooms. Otherwise I don't think you would be disappointed if you booked here. (NB if anyone makes reference to the call to prayer at 5.30 in the morning you will hear this EVERYWHERE over town even with ear plugs in and it is very atmospheric. Just make the most of the cultural experience if you can).,Date of stay: February 2014,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Horsham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/165louisea
Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,James C wrote a review Feb 2014,50,Winter sun in Marrakech,This was our second time visiting Les Trois Palmiers and our visit this time was as wonderful as it was when we first came back in 2011. The riad itself is beautiful and provides a calming environment in which to relax and really get in to holiday 'mode'. We loved lazing on the terrace in the afternoons with some mint tea alternating between cushions in the sun and shady corners.    The location of the riad is perfect for exploring the Medina being about a 15 minute walk from the main square Djema el Fna which is the hub of the action. It's equally easy to go the other way and grab a taxi if you want to go further afield or you could simply walk to the Nouvelle Ville as we did to visit some of the attractions there like the Majorelle Gardens.    The staff at the riad could not do any more to make your stay as relaxing and memorable as possible. That was our main recollection from 2011 and one of the reasons for going back again; they did not disappoint this time around. Nothing was too much trouble and there was always advice and suggestions if and when we wanted them.    This time we also took advantage of some of the excursions on offer going in to the Atlas mountains one day and doing a cookery class in the riad one morning. Both were fantastic experiences again made all the better by the friendliness of the staff as well as their flexibility to adjust plans to suit our preferences.    Patrick Caroline and all of their staff make any holiday here a wonderful experience.

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,robyn r wrote a review Jan 2014,50,Wonderful!,I cannot say enough about this hotel and their staff. They were absolutely wonderful. From picking us up at the train station giving us directions to navigate the souks and organizing a day trip everyone was so nice and overly accommodating. The riad itself is gorgeous and is equivalent to a five star hotel. The pictures do not do it justice. We stayed in a rooftop room and it had a nice view of the city and plenty of lounge spaces to relax. The room and bathroom were very beautiful and clean. We also had breakfast and dinner at the hotel and both were fantastic. I have always wanted to go to Morocco and had visions of indoor pools beautiful tiles and traditional Moroccan details. This hotel has all of this with modern amenities and is just steps from the souks. We researched a lot of riads while planning for this trip and many were considerably more expensive. I honestly think this hotel is a terrific value and really does feel like a luxury hotel. If I am ever back in Morocco I will definitely be staying here.,Date of stay: October 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Savannah, Georgia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robynr954

Staff will serve the included breakfast wherever you want it and it includes a nice homemade youghurt as well as bread and fruit.

Pat took the time to tell us the history of his hotel as he showed us around which in many ways mirrors the development of modern Marrakech. Breakfast was filling fresh and left us full. We had dinner at Trois Palmiers both nights of our visit each night opening a Tajine to a delicious satisfying surprise! Staying within the Medina was perfect as we walked everywhere we wanted to go including the Majorelle Gardens. The souk and the Djema el-Fna were an easy walk both there and back. (I get confused easily) The room was perfect in size for all 4 of us (9 and 11 year old boys + Mom and Dad) as they put in an extra bed. The bathroom was luxurious and the beds were really comfortable. The boys even swam in the small plunge pool. The roof-top is remarkable for it's views and comfort.

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,Paul B wrote a review Aug 2013,40,Perfect choice for us,We needed an overnight in Marrakech and selected this riad on recommendation from people in Essaouria where we were going the next day. The riad set up a taxi from the airport to the hotel which is a must because like most riads it is inside a souk; you cannot drive up in front. Instead we were met at an entrance to the souk and guided to the riad. Do not use riads if you have a lot of luggage because you are likely to have to haul it yourself.  The riad is isolated in an alleyway and very quiet. It is well decorated and contains several comfortable sitting areas which are essential because rooms are typically small. The room we had is tiny; the double bed just fit into the space. Neverthelesswe were comfortable and it worked for us. However I am not sure I would want several days in a room in which the suitcases took up most of the room.  You could also have a problem if you don't speak or understand French. I had communicated with people in English but no one was present at the riad who spoke it. However my wife is fluent so we managed well.  People are very nice and accommodating. Food is simple but excellent. Getting from the riad to the medina takes time; it would be easy to get turned around. We were given a hand drawn map. The worse part about Marrakech is if you look out of place someone with an agenda will try to pick you up and guide you. People are nice but typically they want money. They are difficult to shake so important either to accept and negotiate terms or be firm that you don't want help.

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,menon wrote a review Aug 2013,50,local paradise,We stayed at Les trois Palmiers for 5 nights in early April. Patrick is a wonderful host (unfortunately didn‚Äôt get to meet Caroline). He had arranged for Ali to pick us up from the airport (which was a great help). Roads are busy and worse within the medina. The Riad is accessed through a maze of small alleyways but once Patrick gives you his hand drawn map there should be no problem. Staff are excellent very helpful. It‚Äôs just a perfect place to relax. The Riad was originally two houses and now has 12 bedrooms. We stayed in Idrisside right on the terrace smallish room but extremely tastefully done. Electric sockets are two round pin Schuko. There is free wi-fi but it does not reach the terrace. Breakfast is served in the terrace and is ample. The Riad does provide dinner to if you have booked with them. Money can be exchanged in the Riad or just outside at the local currency shop. The rates were excellent.  If taking a room on the top floor be prepared for the early morning call to prayers (sound like a million megaphones going off at the same time) one gets used to it after a while. Ear plugs are a must. We will definitely go back to LTP. April is a good month as the sun is not too hot and the rains have just finished. great restaurants near by.,Date of stay: April 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Peterborough, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/menonrina

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,GlennB0 wrote a review Jun 2013,50,Excellent retreat in the heart of Marrakech,"My wife and I stayed here for 5 nights in May 2013 and much like the rest of the reviews we were a bit overawed with the activity of the old city and the labyrinth of lanes and alleyways to get to the Riad. Do yourself a favour and arrange an airport pickup with the Riad. Entry into the Riad is like entering another world with luxurious surrounds waterfalls pools and comfortable lounges etc.  The staff are fantastic and very welcoming the driver Mohamed is particularly helpful and knowledgable and nothing is too much trouble. Eg. One staff member walked us out to the nearest main street(?) ""Dar El Bacha"" (about 150m) through the alleys and pointed out all the landmarks we would need to find our way back. Turns out it only looks confusing until you know what to look for.  We arrived late in the afternoon and had pre arranged dinner at the Riad to save the hassle of finding somewhere at short notice. Glad we did the food was local themed and excellent with tagine and several other courses. The nearby restaurants are also extremely good.  We were initially worried about walking after dark in the area but felt safe throughout our stay.  In summary an excellent place to stay with good facilities and great staff within a very short walk to the stalls and markets of the medina and about 10 minutes walk from Jamaa el Fna",Date of stay: May 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Sydney, Australia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlennB0

The family who run it and their staff are delightful and attentive without being intrusive and the ambiance is that of tranquility and relaxation in the heart of Marrakech's bustling medina. It's beautifully decorated and restored by a couple who clearly love it and wish for their guests to be happy and comfortable.

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,acandkc wrote a review Apr 2013,50,A Jewel Box...,Do yourself a big favor and just book your reservation to this riad right now! My husband and I just had a six night visit at this riad and we were so happy with everything about it. Yes it is down a long and winding alley but this is Marrakech after all! From the moment you enter you are made to feel welcome and at home. This open courtyard with the three palms the well trained and very friendly staff the beautiful furniture and stained glass windows and iron work and pools....and the relaxing and breezy and cool rooftop patio this is a place that is an oasis after navigating the souks and squares of Marrakech! Patrick and Caroline want you to feel at home...and do a wonderful job of attaining that goal. They will also set up day trips for you that are reasonably priced and adventurous and you will be driven by their friendly guides. So let Ibraham pour some hot mint tea for you....try out your ( at least in my case) rusty French... and Arabic and Berber....listen to the quiet from the roof and the water trickling in the pools in the courtyard and you will feel like you could stay here for a thousand and one nights!,Date of stay: April 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Richland, Washington",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/acandkc
Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,Sn0bby_Traveler wrote a review Apr 2013,30,Will stay at another place next time,I think this place gets good reviews because compared to its surroundings it is definitely a haven. When one walks in one is charmed by the decor the owner Patrick everything is so clean and fresh compared to the donkey poo small alleyways dust rubbish and loose pavements to get there.    My family did a short stay in March. The service by the staff is faultless. The breakfast inc is good though you will only get carbs and no protein. 2/3 beds were comfortable though the third bed was missing planks in the middle which meant the mattress sagged. The bathroom had an awful sewer smell coming from it the entire time. To top this all off you do not get a key or code to enter. Once you finally negotiate your way to the Riad you have to knock on the door or press the bell to be let in. You could be standing there for 10 minutes or more and this is what happened for many guests at 12-1am when I was trying to sleep.    Knock knock ding-dong ding-dong knock knock. If that's not enough local kids hang around the Main Street to help show you to the Riad if you are lost and then ask you for money afterwards. In fact I was harassed by the kids for 2 days about it.    It's a lovely Riad compared to where it is but probably not compared to other Riads and hotels you could choose from.,Date of stay: March 2013,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sn0bby_Traveler

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,J C wrote a review Apr 2013,50,Brilliant place to stay,An absolutely perfect place to stay and immerse yourself in the true Marrakech. Service was first class from booking to being driven to the airport on departure. All the staff are very friendly and take a genuine interest in your comfort. Nothing is too much trouble from breakfast on the beautiful rooftop terrace to cool drinks delivered to whatever comfortable spot you have found to relax. Never experienced such attention to detail and service from an owner who obviously cares about how his guests are looked after and this passion naturally rubs off on his staff.  Ideal oasis of peace and tranquility from which to launch yourself into the hustle and bustle of the city. Would recommend being collected from the airport by the riads own driver to ensure you don't get stung by airport taxis and also to ensure you can find the hotel (all riads are tucked away in the old part of the city and need reliable local knowledge to find them).

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,Peachybotham wrote a review Apr 2013,50,"Luxurious, friendly, quiet riad - an oasis of calm amongst the madness",Stayed in this riad for 5 nights in April. We had one of the best holidays ever made very special by the trip we booked through Patrick the owner before we went out to Marrakech. The owners Patrick and Caroline his wife are very welcoming and will do all they can to make your stay comfortable. All the staff are very friendly and so helpful and attentive without being over the top. Rooms were clean and comfortable tidied and refreshed with towels and essentials every day. We stayed in one on the terrace and were initially kept awake with the wind blowing the plastic cover for the courtyard. However once the wind dropped we were pleasantly surprised by how peaceful it was. The covers are taken off mid April once the threat of serious rain has gone. The breakfasts were lovely with freshly squeezed orange juice yoghurt (so creamy) eggs (if wanted) pastries coffee tea bread and jams and honey as well as fresh fruit every day. Every morning fresh covers were put on the sun loungers as well as straw hats for the guests use and the umberellas were erected for us. Room/terrace service was available all day and the final bill was very reasonable considering how many coffees teas and beers we had ordered and they all came with little treats! We were so glad we had arranged the 3 day trip to the desert prior to travelling out there. It was such fun seeing the beautiful dramatic country with Ali our driver who was a complete star. The camel riding is a bit hard on the rear but well worth it for the experience of getting into the sand dunes to stay in a bedouin tent. The hotel we stayed at during the trip was great as well and we were impressed by how smoothly it all went. No hitches no delays and it felt like a total Moroccan experience. We were picked up and dropped off from the airport with no problems. The only difficulty is finding the riad on first night on your own when everything looks different and the alleys all look the same!

My brother and I stayed here just over a year ago and were completely impressed by the service we received. We are Canadian and it was our first experience in Marrakech. Once you get through the winding roadways and into the Riyad it's like a whole other world - stunning sanctuary. Wonderful hosts great food lovely ambience and within a walk to everything in the old city. Also did the ATV excursion which the folks at the Riyad helped us organize as well. Can't say anything bad about this place at all. Again if it's your first time to Marrakech just keep in mind that there are some winding narrow passageways to get to the Riyad but this is the case with anything in the old city and it felt safe once you understood that (try to arrive in day light so you don't freak yourself out though!)

Yet is hidden away as a beautiful escape from the noise of the day and offers all you need from a boutique hotel. Patrick the owner and all the staff are very friendly helpful and attentive but give you the space and run of the hotel so you feel relaxed and at home from the moment you arrive. You can relax with a book in one of the many sofa nooks or up on the roof terrace and be served English Tea in silver pots whenever your in the mood. Patrick provides great advice on where to go and what to do and provides hand drawn maps to navigate the Medina.. You will get lost but that is all part of the charm of wandering around Marrakech.

Generous with their time and information tirelessly providing maps and helping us with trips tips guides and travel plans they were perfect hosts. Perfectly positioned within the medina walls this is a relaxed and stylish riad with plenty of places to sit and chill out from the inner courtyards to the roof terrace it certainly ticked all of our boxes!    We had two rooms on the first floor they were clean spacious and comfortable. The bathrooms had walk in showers lots of towels robes toiletries and plenty of piping hot water. The food was great - amazing breakfasts with fresh fruit freshly baked bread and the most delicious home made yoghurt. We also ate dinner here. (twice the first one was so good we wanted to do it again!) We had a candle lit rose petal strewn table and thoroughly enjoyed incredible morrocan salads fabulous cous cous tender chicken fragrant strawberries and yummy pastries as well as copious amounts of mint tea.

Ali met us at the airport and whisked us to ""Riad Les Trois Palmiers"" giving an introduction to the city and Medina as good as any guide. The short walk through confusing narrow alleyways to the Riad gave us a taste of what was to come in navigating the souks and markets. Through a heavy door embellished with three brass palmswe emerged to a delight of a riad filled with the charm and authenticity Morocco is famed foryet the tranquility and comfort craved for at the end of the hectic days to come. Caroline and Patrick were the most gracious of hosts and together with attentive staff spared no effort to ensure that our every need was met They insisted that we treat the Riad as our home and it certainly felt comfortable to do so.

The driver dropped us as close to the hotel as the Medina would allow where another member of staff collected us and guided us on foot to the Riad. Quite an assault on the senses avoiding bicycles mopeds and pedestrians we were taken a short walk along the street then turned into a narrow low roofed passage stopping at the corner shop to pick up fresh bread for our evening meal. We were then lead down what seemed to be a maze of dark busy and narrow passages until we turned right into a very dark passage and were confronted with a big oak door.

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,Gumbootlou wrote a review Feb 2013,50,Wonderful Riad!,"My husband and I have just returned from a weeks stay in Riad Les Trois Palmiers and we had and absolutely wonderful time. The Riad itself is tucked away down what can only be described as a 'backstreet' and to be honest you wonder where you are being taken when you first arrive as it doesn't seem possible that such a beautiful spacious place can be hidden behind the walls. We arrived quite late on a Tuesday night and were shown to our room and then sat down to a lovely first night meal which we had pre booked and I'm glad we had a going out into the Medina for the first time in the dark would have been quite daunting. I would definitely recommend a first night meal there anyway until you get your bearings.  The following morning we were greeted by Patrick who really is a great host and he drew us a map of how to get to the square and gave us a few pointers on what to look out for. Before we left for Marrakech I'd read many reviews good and bad and really wasn't sure what to expect and was more than a little apprehensive but I found the city colourful completely atmospheric and very friendly in the main. Yes you get people shouting at you to come and look at there stalls or eat their food or drink their orange but a big smile and La Shukran ( no thank you in Arabic) usually has them smiling back at you and being asked ""maybe next time?"" Or you accept their offer and see what they can offer you and in the shops you'll more often than not get offered some wonderful mint tea. And I usually ended up buying something! But this was out of choice if you don't want to buy move on....you are under no obligation. Two warnings I have are about the Henna ladies and the so called guides... The henna ladies grab you a lot and try to start drawing on you. A firm La Shukran seems to work better than speaking in English or French. And in the streets out of the square you will get lots of men start talking to you and then start taking you to either the tanneries or back to the square and then want paying for it....steer clear if you can they just want your money. We got totally lost looking for the museum and decided to use a guide who then took us to the wrong museum and it was actually shut (which he knew because the Berber market was on) and then took our money and ran. A lovely man then helped us and found someone to take us who didn't want a penny just a chat along the way.  The little things you must do! Drink the orange juice and mint tea eat in the square at night even if its only once. We looked for a stall with local people and found one along the edge (even though we'd been told to eat in the middle) and the food was great and try one of the egg sandwiches you see being made on the street the bread is wonderful and who knew that a little sprinkle of cumin on egg could taste so good!  There are a few trips you can take organised by Patrick and the day trip to the Ourika Valley and Atlas Mountains is a must. You stop to see how Argan oil is made and can buy some from a reputable source as most of the oil in the square and souks is apparently fake. You the take a trek in the mountains to see the waterfalls but be warned this is more than just a nice amble up the mountain. If you are unfit like I am (!) or infirm in any way you will struggle. It is hard work going up and down but worth it in the end. You then go to a Saffron farm where again it is safe to buy as the market has a much lower quality.  Back to the Riad the staff are brilliant and Halid looked after us particularly well. Always running up and down the stairs to the Terrace to see if we needed anything. We ate there 4 nights out of the 7 and each meal was lovely although we had a lot of orange salad for pudding....nice but repetitive. The Riad also has a small but nice selection of wines and spirits for those of you wondering if you will be able to get an alcoholic drink. Mint tea flows and is lovely and complimentary. We stayed in the Bahia room which although small was spotlessly clean and came with a private terrace so almost like another room. We ate breakfast on it and in the afternoon it caught the sun so perfect for chilling and reading or catching a few rays. It was hot in Feb when the sun came out though so I don't think I could sit there in the summer.  All in all we had a fantastic time and will be returning and won't even consider staying anywhere else.

He then led us through a series of narrow winding laneways pointing out little features here and there so we'd remember our way next time (turn at the laughing cow sign left at the potplant etc). Around one corner was a tethered donkey around another zoomed a local on a motorbike offering a friendly smile. I felt like I had entered a Moroccan version of Alice in Wonderland. We arrived in a dim dusty lane knocked at a low heavy door and entered what truly was a wonderland. Gentle light filters into an inner courtyard chill-out music mingles with the trickle of water into the plunge pool and luxurious Moroccan decor provides an instant sense of peace and relaxation.We enjoyed a delicious dinner under the watchful eye of a resident cat and breakfast each morning consisted of delights such as homemade yoghurt warm flat bread freshly squeezed juice etc. Complimentary mint tea served in silverware is available at any time during the stay. The rooms are charming spotlessly clean quiet and private. We couldn't believe how lovely it all was especially considering the reasonable price. It's in sharp contrast to the dusty hot noisy chaotic atmosphere of the souk and the main square which is a short stroll away (maybe 10 minutes) but contrasts are part of the city's beauty. From the sweet and salty elements in the food to the simultaneous warmth and cunning of the market vendors and the calm of riads and day spas that takes over the moment you step off the street. Go with an open mind conservative clothes and a cautious eye and you'll appreciate the city for the fascinating marvel that it is.,Date of stay: August 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Sydney, Australia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lauraa336
Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,Unknown1000 wrote a review Jan 2013,50,The best place to stay in Marrakech,We recently enjoyed a fabulous 3 night stay at Riad Les Trois Palmiers. It truly is a magical oasis in a fabulous location ‚Äì with all the comforts one could wish for and close to the hustle and bustle of the main attractions of the medina. The Riad is spacious with two large courtyards and a beautiful roof terrace with a fantastic view of the city. There is more than enough room for all the guests to relax! The wonderful friendly and helpful staff went out of their way to make sure we felt at home and nothing was too much trouble for them. Delicious fresh food and drinks are available to guests at any time. We would encourage anyone visiting this vibrant and colourful city to explore it from the Riad Les Trois Palmiers.

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,Suzy B wrote a review Jan 2013,50,A True Hide-a-way RIAD in the Medina of Marrakech,"Jan.1-9 2013 my husband and I escaped the world at the Riad Trois Palmiers in the impenetrable old residental area of the Medina. We knew from Google Maps where we were supposed to be but it was a good thing to be met by the staff both at the airport and at the street end to be guided in through mysterious passages to the door of the Riad.  Much of the passage was covered how would we ever have found this place?  No matter by the next day we were experts.  Already an adventure to find the Riad itself was perfect warm and welcoming and beautifully restored and decorated by Patrick and Caroline our hosts. Our room the ""Alaouite"" room was exactly as pictured in the website but better. Heavy wooden doors and window frames with coloured glass panels opened onto the courtyard below.Totally charming and private. Great bed bathroom too exotic to believe we felt like VIPs. And that is the standard of the Riad; the best chef the wonderful staff who treat you like long lost family. We loved it. Forget going out to dinner or breakfast bring lots of books or read the books in the library nothing is lacking here.  The wines of Morocco are served in the Riad and in most restaurants that serve alcohol. We enjoyed the white and Rose wines and Patrick can suggest good choices. Patrick is the go-to person for advice on excursions out of Marrakech. With a comfortable SUV and driver Ali we made several trips one to the Atlas Mountains with a mule ride up the inacessible to a hilltop Berber village and a brilliant lunch in the sunshine overlooking valleys on two sides with snow a few hundred feet away. This is a must ask Patrick to arrange it for you. In fact ask Patrick what he suggests for places to visit in Marrakech. He always visits every suggestion made by guests to check out the venue for himself and his taste is impeccable. This also goes for places to eat although on review the Riads's chef was the best.  The location is ideal within the Medina and near the Souks and most historical must-see sites.  We walked everywhere and enjoyed exploring the city at a leisurely pace.",Date of stay: January 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Vancouver, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SuzyB_13

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,KellyEllenB wrote a review Jan 2013,50,The only way to see the real Marrakech,My husband and I stayed at the end of December for a 9 night stay. We stayed in 2 different rooms during out trip and both were excellent I especially loved the traditionally tiled bathrooms one with amazing sunken bath. Like most of the other reviews here we also found the Riad to be a welcome haven from the madness and intensity of the Medina but with literally so much to see and do on your doorstep you do have to force yourself to slow down and relax inside.  We took several days to do just that and after a stroll around the Medina in the morning we came back to the Riad and spent the afternoon and a good part of the evening sitting on the roof terrace reading relaxing and drinking the excellent mint tea.  Breakfast was included in our package and we were able to take it on the roof terrace most mornings in the sun before heading out for the day.  We also had a tasting menu dinner the first night that we arrived and this was excellent and a really good idea to do on your first night there after a flight as it can be stressful enough trying to find your way around for the first day or two.  The staff in the Riad are the main highlight however the owner Patrick was a superb host and spent time with us sorting out restaurants and things to do to make our holiday perfect. The other staff are also so helpful and genuinely nothing seems to be too much trouble. Every evening we were greeted back at the Riad by Ibrihim and he always had a laugh and joke with us and was truly a delight to deal with he is a credit to the Riad.,Date of stay: December 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Belfast, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KellyEllenB
Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,Dave L wrote a review Jan 2013,50,Thanks Patrick!,I would echo most other reviews. It is a beautiful home it the middle of a bustling town. As old American men we were forever saying no to the pushy shop owners in the Medina. So it was nice to get back to the quiet Riad.    Traveling with two friends it was a challenge to find rooms with three beds but the Almoravid room had 3 singles and while it was on the small side the entire three story Riad was common ground with couches small swimming pools tables and chairs ect.    The service was very good (it helps if you can speak some french) Patrick saved us by checking our departing flight and noticing it left an hour earlier than we thought. He then got us a driver (Ali-very nice fellow) who got us to the airport just in time.,Date of stay: November 2012,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"New Brighton, Minnesota",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Larsmatic

The staff from Ali who picked us up at the airport to Khaled who was always on hand ready to please to Mohamed and Ebrahim who accompanied us to the Atlas and not forgetting the lovely ladiesto many to mention by name who always greeted us with a friendly smile and an eagerness to help in any way. We stayed in the Saadienne Suite which is huge and beautifully decoratedwith a very comfortable King bed and a bathroom with a shower and bath that was surreal. Breakfast was good and sufficient. This was the first time we stayed in a Riad and we were apprehensive but our fears were unfounded as it was memorable to say the least. We loved everything about it and highly recommend it.

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,Emstargold wrote a review Jan 2013,50,"Fantastic, excellent and truly beautiful Riad",We decided to visit Marrakech for New Year for four days. We found the Riad on Tripadvisor - reading many five star reviews - and decided to book.    The level of service from Riad Les Trois Palmiers was exemplary; from its owner to its staff we were treated like king and queen. We were picked up from the airport given a history of the Riad and also taught (from the staff) how to make the famous Moroccan mint tea.    Patrick (the Riad's owner) is very welcoming very chatty and is always around to help and give advice from simple bargaining tips in the Souks to the best place for a memorable Hammam. The staff are very friendly and did their upmost to help in any way they could. We were told to treat the Riad as our home.    We stayed in the Saadiene suite which was beautiful. A huge bed decorated with rose petals on arrival. A comfy chaiselongue to put your feet up and relax and a very luxurious bathroom with his and hers sinks made with beautiful intricate mosaic and a huge shower area.    The food was amazing. We enjoyed breakfast on the terrace with freshly squeezed orange juice various breads yoghurts and eggs. We decided to stay in for two nights and had the set menu. three starters a tagine main course and dessert.... we rolled to bed on those evenings feeling very full!    I have been to Marrakech a couple of times before and different every time.

The staff are wonderful and were so ready to please. However I felt that they were some what stretched particularly at breakfast - this was not a problem if you did not have an activity planned and were happy to sit in the sun on the terrace.  A clean and convenient Riad. If you do not intend to visit places outside of the city I would suggest that 3 to 4 nights is enough based in Marrakech for an interesting cultural city break and a little winter sun!,Date of stay: December 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Harlow,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Janie024
Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,792AK17 wrote a review Jan 2013,50,Wonderful home from home,"Marrakech was such an eye opener for us. We arrived late evening not knowing where we were going. Greeted by the taxi driver we exchanged our currency as advised and followed him to the car park ""my car is here"" we walked amidst a fold of of Mercs then to the fiat oh heck! No need to worry. We had a journey with commentary to the riad and felt looked after then our first journey from the car down the alley to our accommodation we became quite apprehensive. No need to worry behind the door in the wall lay an amazing labyrinth of the riad. Moushine was an absolute star he made us feel like royalty nothing was too much trouble not only on our first night but every night. The meal waiting for us was excellent we wish we had been more hungry to appreciate it. Breakfast each morning was truly overwhelming (sorry ladies we could not eat it all).    Aidan is another star great guy. He led us through the streets of the medina towards the square giving us tips en route and pointing out places to eat etc. We felt well prepared to face the hustle and bustle on our own armed with our map with all the 'good things' to look out for marked clearly. The accommodation is superb a real home from home so relaxing. Everything we could need was provided including travel adapters - never known that to happen before brilliant idea!    Although escaping from Christmas in UK there was enough recognition that it was the festive season without being overpowering - a Christmas tree and minimal decorations. Christmas dinner for us was a 'take away' and champagne on the roof terrace. How different is that. But the best bit was when presented with champagne on ice mince pies and nibbles as we came out of our room in the evening. Wonderful. Thank you.    The riad made our stay in Morroco it exceeded our expectations.    We will definitely recommend the riad to friends and colleagues and would not stop anywhere else if we return to Marrakech.",Date of stay: December 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Nottingham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/792AK17

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,shootemup77 wrote a review Nov 2012,50,Unmatched Service,I spent two nights at the Riad Les Trois Palmiers with my wife and my 2-year-old daughter. The Riad is beautiful and quiet giving us a well needed break from a day in the the motorcycle-congested streets of Marakech. If I were to rate the Riad itself without taking into account service I'd probably give it four stars (I'm very critical). However the staff working there including the owner Pat were so amazingly friendly and hospitable that I cannot give them less than 5.    When I say they go out of their way to help you I mean that in the most literal sense. For example my daughter was hungry one late morning and I was all out of food I went in search for something she might like at their kitchen but it was closed. not to disappoint us the caretaker left the Riad and came back 10 minutes later with some bananas apples and bread. My daughter quickly relished in the delicious fruit (as did I). Needless to say we were very pleased.    This is just one of many examples of the level of service we experienced at the Riad. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who's looking for a place to stay while visiting Marakech (with or without children).    Oh and I almost forgot. They have a stroller that they let us borrow during our stay. We knew this ahead of time so we left our stroller back home and used theirs instead. It was very convenient not having to drag one around with us during our flight to/from Morocco.

Les Trois Palmier did not disappoint us in any way. We arrived at 10am after being picked up from the airport by Ali and meandering through small alleyways towards the Riad. We were welcomed into the hotel by Patrick and Khaled. After being given traditional mint tea and small sweet/pastries we were shown directions on a map and then taken to our room which was simply stunning.    We instantly felt at home and settled in immediately. We came and went as we pleased and there was someone to help us if we needed anything at all. We arranged 2 excursions via the Riad with very little notice and both were immense (Marrakech by Air and Tour of the Ourika Valley).    We did not eat at the Riad in the evenings for no specific reason but even though they serve food we were still recommended where to go which I thought was good. However we did enjoy the breakfast; lovely and generous which is needed to set you up for a day in the Medina.

It is true that to find it on your own would be virtually impossible so ensure you have the riads driver collect you from the airport. The location is brilliant as you are minutes walk from the main square and souks. Make sure you take breakfast on the lovely rooftop terrace homemade yoghurt and freshly squeezed orange plus everthing else you could want.The room we had was on the middle floor and this would be the quietest area and the rooms are larger.Be prepared for a very hard bed though!,Date of stay: September 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Bucks,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BucksAngel
Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,hop2manual66 wrote a review Sep 2012,50,"Fantastic Riad, ticks all the boxes",This is our second visit to Marrakech and after having such a lovely time at the riad last time we booked again. We were not disappointed picked up at the airport and we emailed Patrick the owner ahead to ask for dinner to be prepared in the riad. It was tasty as usual. We had cocktails and beers (yes alcohol is available and very reasonably priced. We had been upgraded to a suite which was lovely large bed fresh crisp white bedlinen robes products in the bathroom. Lots of hot water and a very powerful shower. Clean towels every day. Just what you expect from this type of riad. This riad is perfectly placed for all the local sites everything is walkable. A short distance from the main square. I cannot find fault with this riad and would always choose to stay there whenever we visit which we certainly will again.

The ambience was lovely and peaceful and Patrick could not have been more helpful. One night I stayed in and ordered dinner which was perfect and a good bargain. Rooms are beautiful quiet and well priced.

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,Mary C wrote a review Sep 2012,40,Very impressed with the hotel and the service,I really didn't know what to expect with a Riad but I read the reviews of the Riad Les Trois Palmiers and decided to give it a try. What a great time. This Riad was exceptional and Patrick and his wife were truly helpful. They both went beyond my expectations of service. Even after we checked out our train to Fes was cancelled and I called Patrick for help. He quickly provided advice and we were well on our way. The location of this Riad is great; only a few minutes walk to the heart of the medina. Stay at the Riad Les Trois Palmiers and enjoy a wonderful experience.,Date of stay: October 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Derby, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/220MaryC
Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,GuyFromPasadena wrote a review Sep 2012,50,Excellent value and service,The rooftop terrace was spectacular. The two intimate pools were a welcome relief from the Kech heat. We found our twin bed bedroom quite large and the bathroom enormous by Moroccan standards. The a/c was powerful breakfast tasty and satisfying. The wifi worked best in the lobby and was not usable in the bedroom. The rooms people were friendly and helpful. The location was excellent: easy access within the medina but felt quite safe and secure. The airport and rail transfers were convenient and offered without hesitation. We had dinner there one evening and the tajine was delicious.,Date of stay: August 2012,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Pasadena, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GuyFromPasadena
Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,COW6Y10 wrote a review Aug 2012,50,Home from Home,Riad Les Trois Palmeirs was a wonderful oasis of calm and hospitality amongst the hustle and bustle that is Marrakech. I stayed with my family there for 3 nights and I can say it is the best place I have stayed anywhere in the world. It would probably be impossible to find if you are on your first visit to Marrakech so I would highly recommend taking advantage of their airport pick up and drop off service that the Riad offers. We were met by Ali (the driver) and Mustapha (the manager of the Riad). Both of them were gentleman and we can not praise them highly enough. We had planned our break to Marrakech some months in advance all communication via email was answered promptly and clearly. The Riad offers excursions and activities that are well planned and cheaper then booking independently. We went on a day trip to the Ourika Valley and also camel riding both of which were excellent experiences and were well planned. The guide for the Ourika valley excursion Mohammed was excellent and more or less carried our 5 year old all the way. In terms of the Riad it was beautiful down to every detail. As other visitors have commented the roof terrace provided a perfect area to have a meal or just relax after a day in the city. However for us the staff were the highlight of our stay. Everyone was incredibly hospitable and considerate. As mentioned by previous visitors to the Riad. Nothing was to much for them and you genuinely felt like part of a big family. Mustapha is a wonderful man and went out of his way to assist us. Also he never stopped smiling what ever the time of day/night. Khalid's advice on all areas made things so much easier also his well practiced hand drawn maps to Jema El Fna where spot on. Ali (the driver) was always feeding us with information about the city as we drove around. He is also a pretty good singer with a love for power ballads!! The ladies behind the scenes were thoughtful and caring. We have a 5 year old and when we returned from a trip out of the Riad a glass of milk or a towel to have a quick dip in the pool would just appear. Dalia's cooking was amazing I would highly recommend having a meal at the Riad lost count of how many courses but everything tasted delicious and the service was second to none. For the quality of accommodation food and service Riad Les Trois Palmeirs was incredibly good value. We have traveled a fair bit but this is the first time I have felt the need to comment on how exceptional I have found a place. Marrakech is a blast to the senses coupled with 45C plus temperatures being able to come back to such a calm and tranquil place was prefect. In terms of Marrakech lots of positives but also some negatives the battering isn't for everyone. Lots of helpful people and also some not so. But my review is off the Riad and I have nothing but good things to say about it.,Date of stay: August 2012,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/COW6Y10
Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,RobA9_11 wrote a review Aug 2012,40,Magical Riad,We had a wonderful stay at Les Trois Palmiers. The staff and owner were incredibly friendly and helpful and nothing was too much trouble. We were met at the airport by the Riad's transport - efficient and quick and once in Marrakech he parked and took us down what seemed to be endless dark alleyways. We were soon at the Riad and as soon as the door opened we could see the dramatic contrast between the mysterious alleyways to the peace and tranquility of the Riad.The owner has completed an amazing project in getting this to such a high standard. The breakfast on the roof terrace was excellent and the service excellent too. The room was very nice but at the time when we stayed the drains created a smell and the hot water system could not quite cope with the demand. It is not really a place to take young children as noise travels. A fantastic central location and the owner was really helpful in recommending restaurants and in fact pointed u in the direction (and booked it for us) a fantastic restaurant - our best meal in Marrakech.  Would recommend you to stay here.,Date of stay: February 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Truro, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobA9_11
Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,Rick M wrote a review Aug 2012,50,Delightful,I'd been to Marrakesh years before as a student and had loved it but this time I was coming back with my husband and two teenaged daughters. The reviews for the riad were fantastic so we mailed Patrick to see if he had space for 4 nights at the beginning of August. Commiunication was prompt and easy and brilliant double rooms were available.    Every single part of our stay at the riad was exceptional from our collection by Ali at the airport (we'd been delayed 2 hours at Luton and he'd had to wait for us when all others were breaking their fasts with their families) to Mustapha's kind care and smiling greetings at the door when we returned each evening. Our girls 17 and 19 were quite simply in love!    There were other nice touches - one of the employees greeted us with impromptu plates of watermelon when she saw how hot we were after a day's sight seeing in 50 degrees' heat. We were also helped with organising train times to Fez and road travel by Patrick who gently advised us to have a rethink about our intended travel plans as the guide book appeared inaccurate in its estimation of how long it would take to drive through the Atlas Mountains to Taroudant. As a result we did not attempt to do the 7 hour train journey from Fez pick up a car and drive the 6 hours (not 4) to Taroudant in one day - it would've been extremely dangerous to drive through the mountain range in the dark.    Added to this on our journey to Fez I realised that I'd left my credit card in the now open safe in our room. I called Patrick who retrieved it and took care of it in the riad safe until our return 4 days later. It really put my mind at ease and as soon as we returned Mustapha presented me with it again with a smile.    So ..do believe the reviews. They are genuine. I just hope that the riad isn't fully booked for when we want to return with other friends and family in the future.,Date of stay: August 2012,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Cheltenham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RickM968
Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,daf s wrote a review Aug 2012,50,Viva Mustapha...,My girlfriend and I were planning a trip abroad between 5/8/12 and 12/8/12 and wanted more of a cultural experience (apologies in advanced for the cliche) and Marrakech seemed to be the stand-out destination. We set about doing the necessary research on Trip Advisor and the Riad Trois Palmiers emerged as a main contender for accommodation due to all the excellent feedback and the outstanding value for money.    Right from the off the service we received was excellent. The owners were more than happy to answer our queries through email as we sought to confirm dates and ask questions about our visit. Free transfers courtesy of the Riad's main driver Ali (what a legend he was by the way!) were arranged to pick us up from the airport when we arrived and take us back at the end of our seven days.    When we eventually arrived at the Riad after a long day of travelling from the UK (Cardiff) Mustapha was on hand to welcome us and show us our rooms in a friendly and polite manner. I have to say that the staff at Trois Palmiers really made our holiday - they literally couldn't do enough for us. In particular Mustapha and Mohammed were amazing right throughout the week; preparing food for us organising excursions giving advice about the city. In short the service we received from the staff was 7* and I honestly could not fault them - even the cleaners were brilliant!    The Riad itself was exactly as expected; extremely clean quiet and comfortable. The room we had on the top floor was equipped with fully functioning air conditioning which was an absolute GODSEND as the temperature all week was an average 49 degrees. Basically what you see in the pictures is what you get so you won't be disappointed.    The holiday itself was exactly what we had anticipated and therefore I would recommend it to couples who are looking to get away and really experience something different. If you are looking for a holiday where you lounge by the pool all week go out in the evening for some cabaret in a British-themed nightclub followed by some food in a British themed restaurant then Marrakech isn't the place for you.    The city and country is amazing but certainly not for the feint-hearted. If you are visiting the square or the markets be prepared to be hustled! There's no point getting annoyed by it as bartering is a way of life over there. Instead try to embrace it with good humour and a smile on your face! Oh and remember that for every price a merchant requests they will usually accept a quarter of this price for their goods! Also remember that you are in an Islamic country so don't be surprised if you attract unwanted attention by dressing inappropriately.    Also for those of you wondering about Ramadan and how it will impact tourists then I would say it really had a minimal impact for us as visitors to the city in August. I would encourage visitors to be mindful.    Overall I would say that this Riad the people who work in it the location and the overall experience were truly outstanding. Would we return? Most definitely.,Date of stay: August 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Cardiff, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dafs_12
Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,Richard S wrote a review Aug 2012,50,A hidden gem well worth a visit,We stayed here for four nights commencing beginning of August 12 and have nothing but positive things to say about this Riad and Marrakech.  I will keep it brief and to the point as you should read as many reviews as you can.  ...the owners are fantastic from the min you book till the time you leave they can't do enough for you.  ...the Riad is absolutely stunning and far better than any large commercial hotel you can stay in.  ...the courtyards are beautiful and the two pools are a relaxing break from the heat.  ...the photos online do not do the Riad any justice at all.  ...mustapha (night manager) is the nicest guy I have ever met and made us feel like we were staying with family.  ...the food is superb the breakfast is a wonderful selection of pastries pancakes and fruit with tea and coffee.  ...the rooftop is great in the day to sunbathe or relax but magical to enjoy dinner on at night.  ....they organized our trips to the atlas mountains and it was cheaper and better organized than the street sellers.  ...they recommended some beautiful restaurants to eat in and we couldn't fault any of their recommendations.  ...the airport transfers were great and without them I don't know how we would have found it.  Marrakech is an interesting place to visit and I would recommend it to everyone. We will definitely go back again but only if there is space at this Riad. It's like staying at a palace with lose family it's peaceful beautiful relaxing and wonderfully renovated. Try it I promise you won't be disappointed.    Now for the negatives:    There are none if it's 21 out of the riads in Marrakech I'd love to know how the other 20 have got it better cause this is amazing especially for the price.....don't hesitate book it now you'll love it...,Date of stay: August 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/451RichardS451
Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,AmbientFlow wrote a review Aug 2012,50,"Believe the reviews, it is a very good place to stay in.",We (family with a one year old) spent 5 days at the riad. From the moment we arrived until the second we left we felt extremely well cared for. Everyone at the riad went always out of their ways to help us and make us feel really at home.    We came across the riad by using trip advisor's ranking system and after booking on two other places (one intentional another by mistake: Make sure you book at the RIAD and not the HOTEL! they are not the same!). The reviews are correct and it is true that the riad is located somewhat out of the way of regular transit but do not let that put you off. After the first day out you will get accustomed to all the little streets in the medina so this is not going to be a problem even at night. The staff at the riad will draw you a map anyway if needed.    We did not experience any of the negatives mentioned on the other reviews: we had hot water we did not experience noisy neighbours and we were never disturbed by any sewage works.    The room was excellent. We stayed at the Almoravide (fantastic decor in the room just as in the pictures) with three beds plus a cot the owners provided free of charge so we had all we needed. The AirCon system worked perfectly which was good since we were at > 39 degrees average! Our bathroom worked fine no problems with drains whatsoever hot water running all the time. There is no fridge in the room but you can use space on the kitchen if you need to (for baby food for example).    The ryad has two pools which are fantastic to cool down after having experienced the medina in all its hot beauty.    The staff well we really fall short in our words to describe them. Bear in mind we had a one year old kid who has tons of energy to burn. They were all awesome. Kind helpful always paying attention to our needs and anticipating them (cold drinks after a day out cold watermelon in the afternoon preparing breakfast as soon as they heard our son stirring and making noises in his cot). Not only they provide excellent service but they were also giving us a hand with our son helping us get some rest as well.    As for the other amenities the terrace is beautiful the views are fantastic. Especially at sunset when the breeze hits and it is all fresh.    Do try the dinner service. You have to let them know in advance if you want to have dinner and it is fantastic. They also provide lunch if you ask for it (good for us to eat while the baby slept) and it definitely beats eating in the streets although there are lots of good small restaurants to choose from (do try the tajine kafta).    TV: yes there is no TV in the room but do you really go to marrakesh to watch TV ? if you want there are two tv rooms were you can sit in and have a drink while catching up with the world news.    Getting to and from the riad to the airport: The riad will provide a driver free of charge to take you to and from the airport.    Organising days out: Ask the staff at the Riad they will make good suggestions for you and arrange everything. Ask them before booking anything off the street there are a lot of stands offering excursions and when there are so many it is better to aks someone with experience.    In closing you will not regret staying in this Riad. it is a very nice place. Of course you can pay quadruple and stay at a top notch 6 star hotel but the experience will be completely sterile and different. Staying at this riad is a fantastic experience and its location so close to the jemma el fna plaza the souks the koutoubia the bahia palace the medrassa etc. (all walking distance by the way no need for cabs or horse-carriages or anything else) just makes it fantastic. we definitely recommend it and will come back to this place next time we get a chance.

From the beautiful roof terrace to both of the courtyards it was so very easy on the eye.

The staff were so friendly nothing was too for them much. Patrick also offered great advice on what to do while we were there so we went on a 3 day trip (arranged through the Riad) to the Atlas mountains for one night and then stayed in the Sahara desert on the second night which was an amazing experience.

He also arranged a meal for us at another riad on the Saturday night - superb. Breakfast was served each morning up on the roof terrace and was delicious. We mainly sunbathed and shopped.

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,Jacjol wrote a review Jun 2012,50,What an amazing place to stay!,My friends and I stayed in this riad for 6 nights in late June 2012 and could not fault it at all. From the moment Ali picked us up from the airport as part of the service we felt instantly at ease. On arrival at the riad Khalid showed us to our beautiful room with fresh flowers on the bed and petals as an added touch.....it was simply wonderful. We had asked for dinner on arrival and were given a five course Moroccan feast which was amazing and Khalid was very attentive and friendly throughout our first evening.    We had breakfast every morning which set us up for the busy outside world of Marrakesh. The staff at the riad were the friendliest and most helpful that we have encountered while on holiday. Mustafa went out of his way to recommend a restaurant one night to us and then unbeknown to us called ahead to let the restaurant know we were coming along and to take care of us on our arrival.....where else would you find such hospitality.    The riad is very central and only 10 minutes through the amazing wonderful souks to get to the main square. We felt very safe coming and going from our riad at all times of the day and night.    I would not hesitate to recommend Riad Trois Palmiers to anyone who visits Marrakesh and they even organise wonderful trips for you....we spent a day at the Atlas Mountains courtesy of the riad's organisation and were amazed by this wonderful trip and the sights we saw.    This riad was a welcome respite from the hustle and bustle of Marrakesh and chilling out on the rooftop terrace after a hard days bartering with the souks is just sublime.    We would like to thank all the staff especially the lovely ladies in the kitchen Mustafa for taking the most amazing care of us and Khalid for making our first night very memorable. Mr Patrick completed our holiday by presenting us with lovely bracelets on our departure and we were all very sad to leave the riad and Marrakesh but have vowed to return time and time again!

Special thanks to the owners Caroline and Patrick who told us about Midlife Crises...  Special thanks to Ali the driver who met us at the airport transfers were free.  I cannot recommend this riad highly enough. Top service excellent rooms courtyard  a great roof terrace and probably the best (and free) mint tea we were served throughout our entire stay.,Date of stay: June 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Brighton,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SueO539
Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,CL757 wrote a review Jun 2012,50,Best riad we stayed at in Morocco,This riad was by far the best riad we stayed in Morocco. The courtyard was comfortable and beautiful and the rooms were clean and romantic. Best of all the staff were polite and wonderful. They even taught us and let us cook tajines with them in the kitchen. The owner was superbly helpful in our non-existent plans to drive from Marrekesh to Merzouga and then to Fez and recommended a great driver (his name is Mohammed Gouaghi and is a funny very nice guy). I also leaned against the wall and accidentally knocked off an antique looking gun to the floor breaking it but the owners were so nice and understanding!

The location in the Medina is perfect and the rooms are comfortable and beautifully decorated. However what makes this place so special and impossible do dislike is all the staff who works there: Mustafa Khaled Fatima Dalila and all the other lovely ladies. Always around making sure I had everything I needed offering the refreshing mint tea e the delicious traditional biscuits. I felt at home.

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,Jessie P wrote a review Jun 2012,40,A little peace haven in a hectic city...,"I honestly cannot praise this riad enough. From the moment we arrived to the moment we left I just felt so welcome. The owner greeted us on arrival and said ""treat this as your home"" and thats exactly how we were made to feel. I spent 6 days there with my niece and it was absolute bliss. The staff at the Riad are so friendly and Khalil is such a sweet man. Nothing was too much trouble for him. The ladies at the Riad were so helpful too. Our room was so pretty. The bathroom was clean aswell as the room the lighting in the room could have been better.    Breakfast was nice but I would have liked a bit more variety. Also I would have liked to have Wifi access available in my room so I could stream movies in the evening as there was no entertainment system in our rooms (no TV or music player).    The walk to the main square was short (about 10 mins) but a little hectic as the streets are so busy.

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,Emily A wrote a review Jun 2012,50,I would stay again,Excellent breakfast and a generous hostess who allowed us to stay in our room until 5:30pm on the day of checkout- really valuable to be able to shower before heading to the airport after a hot day wandering around. The staff were generally friendly though when asked for a dinner recommendation one of the staff unhelpfully suggested the riad itself. Our room was tiny but immaculate and air conditioned.

The staff was the best Khaled and Mustafa and all the other great women working there made the stay feel like home. The rooms were clean the ambiance was a great escape after coming from the hustle and bustle of the souks. The fresh roses everyday throughout the hotel is a great touch to the elegance of the place. The breakfast on the terrace was heavenly... even when we woke up late we still got something to eat. The location is ideal to walk anywhere and safe. It is a bit tricky to find if you don't get a ride from the airport but other than that we will be coming back next year and hopefully with more people. Thanks Patrick and everyone who works there.

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,Tropics_in_Winter wrote a review Apr 2012,50,"Quiet, Charming, Hard to Find",Best to have one of the staff meet you at the airport or another location and guide you to the riad the first time. It is down several narrow alleys and only marked by the the three palms on the doors there are two. There you may be fortunate to be greeted by Patrick a charming Marseilleaux expat who will orient you to the neighborhood and the top sights of Marrakech. Patrick can also organize tours to the mountains or desert. The people who had our room before us spent a week here and took excursions organized by Patrick. Patrick and his wife Caroline bought and refurbished this riad about 8 years ago. To retain the style of the riad a quiet but grand family home in an otherwise anonymous location they have no signage other than the trois palmiers on the door so that you can be certain you will ring the right bell when you arrive unattended. There are twelve friendly and attentive staff and the service is to a very good standard. The breakfast is very nice and of continental style with good coffee. You can have it on the rooftop terrace if you wish and this is recommended. The rooms and bathrooms are very nice. Although hard to find it is nonetheless not far from the Djemaa el-Fna - the main square - and you can learn to navigate there and back on foot with the instructions that will be provided. It is also close to the Marrakech Museum. You can walk to the Jardin Majorelle in 20-30 minutes but we took a taxi. Navigating around the Medina area can be difficult and there are very few signs and many turnings. It is a good idea to start out with many 10 and 20 dirham coins and bills so you can hire a young man to guide you from point to point if you deviate from the well-known routes. Have a great time in Marrakech and stay in Riad Les Trois Palmiers if you can. Watch out for the scooters and small motorcycles that share the narrow passages with pedestrians but attempt to go much faster. The scooters are the biggest problem with the old town of Marrakech. I would also recommend dining out at the night stalls in the square. Try the soup the dates the desserts the snails etc. It's all delicious and very cheap.,Date of stay: April 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Porto, Portugal",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tropics_in_Winter
Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,BenWolf1 wrote a review Apr 2012,50,Loved it...,You can feel a little shell shocked landing in Marrakech... but being whisked off to the trois palmiers (dont worry when you get lead down a series of covered alley ways to get there!) really helps you deal with the hustle and bustle of Marrakech. The contrast between the Riad and the city outside could not be more stark. Inside les trois palmiers Mustapha and the gang take care of your every need in the stunningly renovated Riad... mint tea becomes quite addictive! Outside the Riad the fun starts about 10 mins walk from the main square (i would not advise residing to close to this area as you want a bit of distance) you have have all the colour hustle an bustle of central Marrakech... book this Riad as you wont regret it!,Date of stay: March 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Leicester,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BenWolf1

As we had not planned much in advance of arriving in Marrakech we relied upon the staff to help us arrange excursions and things to do etc. They promptly booked us a great cookery course a trip into the Atlas mountains and also sorted out coach tickets to the coast.

He is very responsive and since our booking was sort of last-minute this really helped to finalize our accommodation quickly. Our big group landed in Marrakech with no prior plans hoping to figure things out once we got to the Riad and Patrick helped us do just that very efficiently. The folks at the Riad were extremely hospitable and ready to help. The ambiance of the Riad was very impressive it has been restored well and you could almost feel the story of the Riad (as told by Patrick) reverberating off the walls. The rooms are huge and beautiful. We also loved how the Jama' el Fna was a short walk from the Riad so we could just go when we felt like to experience the rush there. The Riad was certainly worth staying in and if I go back to Marrakech I would be thrilled to go back here.

I too stayed here and cannot praise this well run calm and peaceful escape from the madcap world outside the door. I had a room down on the ground floor and loved it. It was enormous and perfect for my requirements. Suffice to say that I did not worry about padlocking the door as I felt as easy as if I had been in a friend's home. I was drawn a map and I have to admit that getting through the Medina is a bit of a challenge but once get the hang of it - no problem. I felt safer walking than I do in parts of London. I was lazy and ate all my meals at the Riad. As I am alone - it is actually more convenient than going into a restaurant. I am not mad on Couscous so I was given something else. One night we had grilled meat on skewers - they just kept coming. The lovely motherly chef Dahlia took pride in what was served and I loved everything that they put in from of me. Patrick and Caroline are simply delightful - it is clear that pleasing the guests is their primary concern. Wifi is available but you'll need to surf on the ground floor as the signal is somewhat limited - I understand that they may be doing something about that - but to me it was no big deal at all.    Do be aware that payment is in cash - and they do tell you this very clearly in their email. They will arrange for you to be collected and dropped back to the airport. Please also be aware that in all cases you are dealing with people both staff and owners who are intrinsically kind. I would trust them totally and left feeling as though I was leaving a good friend. I would think of setting foot anywhere else should I return.    The highest compliment I can pay were Patrick's last words to me as he stopped in the alleys as he sailed along on his moped ""P if you need anything - anything at all - call me at once on my mobile - whatever it may be Please do not hesitate""    I was no longer his guest and yet I had no doubt that he would have helped me had emergency or mishap occurred.

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,The Swan King wrote a review Mar 2012,50,A Real Gem,I've stayed in Marrakech a few times before now each time trying something new. But this is the Riad I shall always stay in from now. The rooms are not the largest I have stayed in but they are well laid out clean and very cosy and 'happy'. There is one mark dropped on the rooms because we had booked a room with a private terrace but were actually placed in a different room. The hotel did make this up to us with a free lunch and the room we were placed in was a very nice room anyway.    The staff and owners of this Riad quite clearly love what they do and want you to be happy. All staff will always acknowledge you as you or the walk past but not in an overly intrusive fashion. They have that perfect balance of discreet but attentive service a balance that is very hard to strike IME.    We ate here every night because the food is superbly cooked in a timely fashion and served in the lovely courtyard of the riad. Also with breakfast you can either take this downstairs in your room or on the terrace. Nothing is too much trouble.    The owner wrote us a very useful map to and from various sites and one thing I wish I had done is to take the offer of the riad's own transport from the airport because it's a bit tricky to find and you will get hassled on the walk to the hotel.    I personally will not even bother looking at other options when in Marrekech in future I have stayed in places three times this price and not been as happy. It's a great little riad and I am sure you will be as happy here as we were.,Date of stay: February 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Brighton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/swanking

Your staff Mustafa Khallid Mohammed and 'the girls' were brilliant. Please pass on our thanks to them all especially to Khallid for his map which I gripped for safety as it was a lifeline to get us from A - B. The first day in Marrekesh an experience like no other - Ive coped easily with Egypt and Bangkok - but WOW the Souks! The motorbikes the donkey cartsthe dust the fumes the bicycles the people and the kids trying to get ' a buck' for telling you the 'Big Square' is in any direction they fancy Its mayhem but you follow your map back to Riad Trois Palmier you walk through that huge wooden door and.................. TRANQUILITY IS ALL AROUND YOU. The lounge with plunge pool. Our bedroom was blissful loads of hot water in a gorgeous shower. A drink or food is always available whatever you want the staff are always on hand to help you.    A fantastic day trip into the Atlas Mountains with 4 new found French friends was organised and Ali our driver was great for explaining so much along the way including visits to a spice producer and restful garden which grew Olives which we watched being harvested. We had such fun.    Our huge breakfasts on the sun terrace were such a relaxing way to start each day and set us up for our adventures. After walking to and from the Riad a couple of times you feel like a native. We always felt safe amongst the chaos so go and visit stay at Patricks lovely Riad have a couple of days in Marrakeshs madness and enjoy!

I enjoyed particularly the terrace where one can view the city and enjoy the sundown . What else can I say? It is a great to place to stay in with an excellent location.  Dr. A.

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,Paul P wrote a review Jan 2012,50,One of the Best Hotel's I've Ever Stayed in,My wife and I recently stayed in this riad in Marrakech. We chose it because of the great reviews it got on this site and we had pretty high expectations on our arrival. All of our expectations we exceeded and this was one of the highlights of our trip. This riad is absolutely beautiful.    The rooms were great and all unique. The courtyard was a great place to eat or simply relax. We enjoyed a fantastic breakfast on the rooftop terrace each morning. It was a great start to the day. It was also the best breakfast we had in Morocco.    The staff was friendly and extremely helpful. Patrick the owner was quite informative and made some great suggestions for places to visit around the city.    The food was some of the best we had during our two week stay in Morocco. I would strongly advise eating at least one dinner at the riad during your stay.    The only problem we had was finding the riad. I would recommend the airport/train station pick-up option. We had a rental car and so tried to use our GPS to drive to it (we got pretty close but the entrance is down a street too narrow to drive a car down).,Date of stay: January 2012,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Toronto, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/229PaulP
Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,Ben_C007 wrote a review Jan 2012,50,Nice Riad in a crazy city!,My partner and I have just returned from a 3 night stay in the Riad Les Trois Palmiers and we can report that it rightly deserves its high ranking on trip advisor.    We had arranged with Patrick to be collected from the airport and we are glad we did although I can honestly say that the drive from the airport was one of the scariest of my life! Scooters (with no lights on) pulling out in front of us from every direction!    The Riad is down a few dark alleys so would be very hard to find if you were not guided to it. Once inside though we were amazed at how nice (and peaceful) the place was and the owner Patrick gave us a look round and then we had a nice meal in the Riad.    Our room Idrisside was on the top terrace and was very nice. There was a good shower and comftable firm bed. Only niggles were one of the bedside lights had no switch there was no hot water out of the sink tap during our stay and also there were no bath towels in the room until the second day of our stay.    One thing neither of us was aware of was that we would be awoken at 5am each morning by men shouting the prayer call from the local mosque so take ear plug unless you are a very heavy sleeper!    There were two very helpful guides - Mustapha and Halid at the Riad and they were always on hand to advise and help if needed.    We would recommend ‚ÄòDar Donab‚Äô restaurant just next to the the Riad in the adjacent Palace ‚Äì setting was lovely and meals not over expensive.    The Riad is in a good location - 10 minutes from the main square Djemaa el Fna if you go the way the guides advise or it takes a lot longer if you go through the souks!    We have never travelled anywhere where the locals are so keen to part you with the money in your wallet! Example whilst walking through the square a man came up to me and put a snake round my neck took a picture and then wanted 300 dirhams (¬£25) for doing so!    Be advised that any locals that try to help you especially if you look lost or even consult your map (which is fairly useless in the maze of alleys that is most of the medina) are either after a tip or will try and guide you to their Uncles/Fathers/Brothers carpet/spice/leather shop etc!!! Be on your guard is all I will say!    Marrakech is a city like no other I have ever been to and in all honesty our three night stay was enough for both of us! There are no pedestrianised areas. Cars scooters and people all share the same tight alleys and we did witness one women being hit by a car. The constant dodging out of the way of scooters did become tiresome towards the end of our stay. Make sure you have good travel insurance!    The city is also not set up for tourism - sign posts are none existent (this may be so that the locals can guide you for their fee!?) and the street names also didn't always correspond to the 3 different maps I had!    The main tourist sites like the old Koranic school museum and Bahia palace were interesting but only on a visual level. There was no information (in English at least) unless you wanted to pay for a guide of which there seemed to be plenty - not all official looking!    All in all it was an interesting short break in Marrakech - the whole experience was certainly an assault on the senses but it was definitely nice to get away from all the chaos at the end of it!,Date of stay: January 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Stafford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ben_C007
Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,AmericanSuzanne wrote a review Jan 2012,50,A fantastic experience!,Patrick and his staff are excellent hosts! They want you to feel at home and you certainly do - it's not like staying in a large corporate hotel at all. I can only compare it to the ryokan in Kyoto we stayed in once - personal service in a beautiful relaxing atmosphere. You can mingle with other guests or enjoy your privacy - the common areas are big enough that you can enjoy them undisturbed by others. We took advantage of the dinner service after our complimentary dinner the first night because the food was excellent and the atmosphere was so wonderful!

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,SAnieK wrote a review Jan 2012,50,A nice surprise!,I booked this Riad on the internet after reading good reviews and decided to give it a try. I was pleasantly surprised to see the place was more beautiful than I expected it to be. The owner Patrick was incredibly friendly and from the moment we walked in made us feel at home. He gave us a tour of the Riad which is calming and peaceful and restored with great attention paid to the smallest of details. Patrick was very helpful and the first thing he did when we walked in was to have tea and pastries brought in while he explained the ways to get in and out of the place and even drew a small map so we would know to find our way back to the hotel. The staff are incredibly kind. Mustafa one of the staff members paid a great deal of attention to making sure we had a wonderful stay if we needed anything at all we just had to ask. We had a comfortable room with a private terrace and ate nutritious breakfasts each morning that included fresh breads jams home made yogurts coffee tea juice and fresh fruits and I was pleasantly surprised to learn that this was complimentary even though it was not mentioned in our reservation.  The Riad is very conveniently located in the heart of the Medina right next to the best antique shops in Marrakech. The Riad stay definitely added a great deal of value to our stay in Morocco and was the highlight of our trip.it did take us a while to check out like a few other reviewers have mentioned but that was largely due to the owner not being present at the time of our check out which does lead me to believe he is probably the only person who deals with check outs so make sure you check out the night before if possible especially if you are planning to leave before the afternoon.  overall excellent stay definitely go ahead and book this one.,Date of stay: December 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SAnieK
Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,T9-Orca wrote a review Jan 2012,50,"When we return to Morocco, we'll stay at Riad Les Trois Palmiers",We'd previously stayed at another riad which was quite nice. But Riad Les Trois Palmiers was a cut above. It's got great reviews in Trip Advisor and it deserves them.    Patrick (one of the co-owners) and the primary staff (Halid and Mustafa) were great giving both good advice and knowing when to leave you alone.    Our room was delightful. The roof-top terraces were a refuge from the city while the interior court-yards were quiet and relaxed. The included breakfasts were standard continental fare with high-quality ingredients.    The location was great a short walk to Djemaa el Fna (the main square) and the souks.    For an authentic Moroccan experience with a touch of European flair this is the place to go. We'll be recommending it to friends and family.,Date of stay: January 2012,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Seattle, Washington",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T9-Orca
Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,Pollewop wrote a review Jan 2012,50,Perfect hideout in the middle of everything!,Riad les trois palmiers & Riad el Bacha are two connected Riads of the same owner (Patrick).  From the first moment we (family of 4) arrived until the moment we left we were well taken care of and felt like visiting family.  Every corner of the Riad is well thought of and even for winter time it was the only Riad we stayed which felt warm.    Absolutely positive for us was:  - the atmosphere in general  - ambient music (local style)  - personal touch by Patrick and his staff  - perfect decoration  - a safe peacefull haven in a world of madness (Medina & Djema el Fna)  - beautiful rooms nice beds  - many relaxing corners in- and outside  - panorama!  - the connection between the two riads  - feeling home scale on 1 to 5 (5 is best)= 5  - breakfast is great!    Room for improvement (almost impossible)  - eating with children starts really late (about 21:00hrs) but I guess if we asked it wouldn't be a problem to eat earlier.  - same music every day (although great for the atmosphere)  - dinner we thought was a bit overpriced for what was offered compared to other restaurants.  - Wifi only in the open area and not in the rooms. (for me and my kids as social network gadget freaks it is the first thing we check). Once you have reception it was fast.    Anyway all we can say is: stay here!,Date of stay: January 2012,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Tilburg, The Netherlands",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pollewop
Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,tablatronic wrote a review Jan 2012,50,New Year's Eve in Marrakech,My wife and I came to Marrakech to celebrate New Years Eve. We stayed three nights at LTP and found Patrick and staff to be very helpful. As soon as we arrived we got a fantastic history of the riad restoration and were shown to our lovely room on the terrace level. Location is prime near Dar El Basha next to many fine antique shops just around the corner.    The hotel unlike many others in the medina did not gouge guests on price or force them to pay for a New Year's dinner. We felt we got tremendous value for money and even enjoyed the company of the other guests.    Though we did get lost in the souks and the surrounding areas a few times we didn't mind wandering until we found our way back. Nothing beats the surprise of walking from a dark alley through a small wooden door into this heavenly riad. We loved our stay here. My only recommendation is to sort out payment/check-out a day in advance to avoid any last minute rushing to accommodate travel schedules.,Date of stay: January 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tablatronic
Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,Guan72 wrote a review Jan 2012,50,Little heaven in chaotic city,We have been staying in the riad back in september but they deserve an absolute big thumbs up! The riad is indeed hidden away in some narrow streets which is the absolute charm of it. Itnis a breath of fresh air in a crazy chaotic city; a place to relax. We have been staying in 2 different rooms as we came back to the riad after our small tour around Marroc (essaouira and ourzazate). Especially the 2nd room looked like a palace room; beautifully decorated and very nice. It is was the honeymoonsuite which we were upgraded to. The food was also very good and the atmosphere on the rooftop amazing. Excellent friendly staff.

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,Piotr K wrote a review Jan 2012,30,Not really great value for money,"The riad is impossible to find on your own from the street (even though it is quite central). The building is hidden deep down in a labirynth of dark dead ends. Presuming it may be difficult to find we ordered a driver from riad to bring us from the airport (even though they asked 20‚Ç¨ for it). The driver has not turned up and we finally found a taxi outside the airport for 12‚Ç¨. Unfortunately once dropped off in the street we were unable to find the riad. One of the hustlers who live off tourists offered help and walked us through the of small streets labirynth for 4 or 5 mins. We offered him ¬£1 for a service but he was unhappy and asked for ¬£10 for it! When we refused to pay he became aggresive and in the end we heard ""f*** you!"". Very unpleasant start!! As one may say this is not directly related to the riad itself (although for me it is) further issues included:  - limited hot water (which is something you DO NOT expect when you pay 125‚Ç¨/night). We stayed there over 3 nights and I complained about not having enough hot water after the first night but it only helped for one night and on the last night we had to take shower in lukewarm water again.  - small cold and dark room  - no TV  Nice building but grossly overproced and - in honesty - I would not stay there again. After this experience we decided to stay outside the medina in Ibis which was 60‚Ç¨ and offered unlimited hot water with no surprises like ""f*** you!"" instead of ""welcome!""",Date of stay: December 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PiotrK_12
Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,Naila London S wrote a review Dec 2011,50,Home away from home,We had the pleasure of staying at the Riad for 6 nights in December and had an amazing time. Patrick and his staff were so helpful and attended to our every need. My husband and i travelled with our three month old daughter and parents - we stayed in two beautifully decorated rooms and enjoyed breakfast in the courtyard. The staff were so helpful and sterilised our daughters milk bottles every day. We enjoyed an evening meal at the Riad and two of the ladies offered to look after our daughter whilst we enjoyed the meal. Khalid Mustafa Mohammed Hafsa Deba Fatima and many other ladies were so great. Ali the driver that picked us up from the airport also took us to the Atlas mountains and the trip included a stop at a true Berber carpet store Saffron Gardens and he was more than happy to stop for us to take photos. Khalid was great and drew us a simple map to get through the alley ways to the big square and it was perfect to help us get around.

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,dom_how wrote a review Dec 2011,50,Perfect place to stay in Marrakech,I had a wonderful stay here with my girlfriend at the end of November. The Riad is beautiful with amazing traditional artesian furniture and lots of thought having gone into its decoration by the owner Patrick. It is truly an oasis of calm situated in a great location in the middle of the bustling medina. The staff are wonderful and make every effort to making your stay as relaxed as possible - from serving Moroccan mint tea on demand to giving you fantastic tips of things to see and do around the city. A highlight was certainly the breakfast on the roof terrace in the sun each morning and we ate dinner at the riad one night which was probably one of the best meals we had during our stay in Morocco. I would certainly recommend staying at this riad and we hope to return at some stage in the future.

It was my first trip to Marrakech and we were not let down by our choice of accommodation. We were collected from the airport and met by the owner and his staff on arrival. After a welcome pot of tea and treats we unpacked before Ishmael briefed us on the city and things to do places to eat etc. He was very helpful as was Patrick the owner.    We ate at the Riad on two nights; traditional Moroccan tagines that were of excellent quality.    The Riad is a beautiful oasis from the busy city of Marrakech!    The location of Les Trois Palmiers is close to the main square (10 minute walk) and you get there via streets of souks. We were also advised by the Riad staff on how to haggle and a rough price that tourists should expect to pay.

We were given a really nice room with fridge and a nice balcony on the back of the hotel the pool area was nice to have as i know not all hotels in marrakech have one.    It was a shame that the safe was 3 euro's per day but the room was really safe anyway.

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,Welshjetset wrote a review Nov 2011,40,Beautiful Riad amongst the Souks - perfect for first timers,My partner and I spend 4 nights in Riad Les Trois Palmiers in September.  We had a free airport transfer included however I would recommend that anyone staying at this hotel arrange their transport with them....it would be near impossible to find alone.  It is in the centre of the Souks down several winding alleyways. On arrival the staff will draw you a map so you won't get lost.  The Riad itself is beautiful. The rooms are stunningly decorated comfortable and very quiet. We had a room on the 1st floor which was spacious with a beautiful shower-room.  The continental breakfast was served on the roof terrace (weather-permitting) which was lovely. We also spent many hours sunbathing on the terrace making our city break particularly relaxing.  The staff are very accomodating and are happy to hep you out in any way they can. They were particularly helpful with restaurant recommendations....our favourite was Terrace des Epices just down the road although Cafe Arabe and Dar Moha were great too.  The location of the Riad is perfect as it's right in the middle of the Medina (old town) so everywhere is within walking distance.  My only criticism of the Riad was the wi-fi strength. There were routers on the ground floor in each half of the building however due to the stone walls wi-i could only be picked up in the communal areas of the ground floor. I'm sure if routers were added to the 1st and 2nd floors this wouldn't be a problem.  Overall though we loved Marrakech and the Riad Les Trois Palmiers made the experience even more special.

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,Emma8303 wrote a review Nov 2011,50,Beautifully friendly & serene Riad.,I stayed at this Riad for 3 nights as a gift for my mums 60th and we had a lovely time the Riad was beautiful and the staff were so helpful and so friendly it was a mixture of staying at your best friends house versus actually feeling like royaltyi really felt they went above and beyond everytime! Which was perfect for my mums birthday (but not intrusive.) eg - we turned up with an hour to meet our guide for our afternoon trip and due to my lack of french language and last minute booking had not properly received a confirmation so Patrick (Owner of Riad) happily called and arranged a place which would be suitable for us to meet our guide also they let us have our room until 6pm on our last day and the breakfast pancakes were better than those our chef cooked on our cooking class.  It was a most relaxing place to stay and after a busy day shopping there are so many places to go and relax reading a book complete serenity.  Would be perfect if you were travelling alone as they are friendly and so helpful or would be ideal for a nice trip with the other half due to the rose petals on the tables and cosy atmosphere.  The location is central enough that you are close to the busy souks less than 5 minutes but close enough to the main roads for any excursions . I would recommend getting the transfers that they offer to ensure you find the Riad the first time though.  I would recommend this riad to any friends and would definately use this Riad if i go back to Marrakech.  the only downside was the weather our weekend so we didn't get to use the roof terrace but we had a look and the view was amazing!,Date of stay: November 2011,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Tring, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Emma8303

No more than 10 minutes from the souks or the famous square and several of the other cultural must sees are easily walkable including the Majorelle Gardens. The staff are very friendly and helpful and take plenty of time to ensure you get your bearings in the maze of alley ways before you set off sight seeing.    Our room was very comfortable and spotlessly clean as was the whole building the roof terrace is beautiful and we were lucky enough to eat breakfast there even in November there are plenty of sun loungers and seats and lots of space to find your own little bit of peace.    All the food we ate at the riad was excellent and they do serve alcohol as well. There was some noise at times from other residents but it did not really bother us I think this is unavoidable when staying in this type of building.    Marrakech is a fascinating (and very noisy city) and even though we returned to the riad very late at no time did we ever feel concerned about our safety.

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,gary g wrote a review Oct 2011,30,Poor basic facilities,In April 2011 our family of three had the misfortune of staying in the Alaouite room on the 1st Floor Les Trois Palmiers  During the first two nights of our stay we had only mildly warm water in which to wash. It was not until our third night that the water was a reasonable temperature and finally on the last night the water reached an acceptably warm/hot temperature for a good shower. One can appreciate the difficulty in shaving without hot water.  The drain in our shower was continually blocked. After an evening shower the water would not drain away until at least the middle of the following day despite our efforts to disperse the water as advised by the manager. It was not a nice feeling to be standing in water that failed to drain away.  Three out of the four evenings/ nights we stayed were plagued by power failures. I‚Äôm afraid I reached the end of my tether when the power failed while was in the middle of a late evening shower. Trying to find your way out of a shower in the darkness is not only daunting but downright dangerous. Unfortunately I not only slipped in the bathroom as I felt my way around I also sat on my reading glasses causing the frames to distort and be almost unwearable. Lucky for me that no serious damage was sustained.  On a positive note I would like to stress that the staff were excellent - they were courteous kind and always helpful. We reported these problems to them during our stay on a couple of occasions in the hope that some remedy could be found but they did re-occur. We then had a longer conversation with them on our departure. However it seems that the problems were outside their control and it appears that the owners have known of these problems affecting the 1st floor for some time.  In summary Les Trois Palmiers is a very nice riad with good staff and at face value the tariff of EUR 130 is reasonable. However at that tariff I do expect hot running water on tap good plumbing and a constant supply of electricity ‚Äì things that we did not always get.  The owners have since offered two nights free accommodation as compensation however they have not replied to our emails requesting alternate compensation,Date of stay: April 2011,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/garyg274

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,LovesTravel1982 wrote a review Oct 2011,50,Simply brilliant!,My husband and I stayed at this Riad in Feb/March 2011 after reading amazing reviews - we couldn't have found a better place to stay! It was an oasis of calm but close enough to all the action of the main square. The staff - Mustafa Khaled et al were absolutely wonderful and couldn't have been better hosts. The rooms were always kept clean and the meal we had in the riad was fab - thank you for catering to our vegetarian needs! Breakfast on the terrace every day was a delight. The staff were also very helpful in helping us organise a day trip to the mountains - highly recommended.    Thank you for making our stay a memorable one and for making us feel at home!

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,Joshiey wrote a review Oct 2011,50,A totally fantastic experience,"Arrived at the riad apro 9.30 am Monday morning.  Our driver Ali was thare to meet us as planned. We drove to the medina where we then began to walk through the alley ways I have got to be honest I thought oh my god is this for real "" have I really paid to come here"" I was feeling a little nervous as I had never expierenced anything like it before ""this was the real morrocan life""  We walked for a few minutes until we arrived at a small wooden door.The door opened very quickly for us to be invited into what we could only describe as a tiny piece of heaven.  This beautiful tranquil place is totally amazing and relaxing.  Whatever good comments you read on trip advisor"" trust us you must believe.""  The owner Patrick was there to greet us and did so with genuine warmth.  The staff at the riad were amazing you are treated with the upmost respect and looked after from start to finishnothing is too much trouble for anyone.  Dahlia the cook welcomed me into her kitchen and gave me a morrocan cooking lesson showing me all the wonderful spices that are used in a typical morrocan dish. Mustaffa was there every morning to greet us for breakfast with his lovely smile nothing was too much trouble for him.  The other staff who I will mention by name are Khalid Fatima salma Hichim Chiba Hiba and Ali they will all play a fantastic and important part in making your stay as tranquil and relaxing as they did ours. They are all amazing.  To sum up our stay. Next year we will be back proberbly at the end of the year when We are both feeling at our dreariest knowing that we will leave totally recharged.  Oh just to let you all know I had nothing to be nervous about. The medina is safeand the morrocan people are lovely.",Date of stay: October 2011,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Joshiey
Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,Harvey B wrote a review Oct 2011,50,An Oasis,We booked this hotel through Lowcostholidays.com and it was a very good choice;4 star very reasonably priced clean comfortable airconditioned room friendly helpful staff good food and a nice swimming pool. As well as the dining room it was very pleasant eating at the tables outside by the pool.  The hotel was well located in a quiet road and yet within easy walking distance of one of the main Plazas where there was a good choice of restaurents banks buses and the tourist information office.

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,Angelcat18 wrote a review Oct 2011,50,Do not stay anywhere else: this Riad is amazing.,"We have just returned from 5 fantastic days in Marrakech made perfect by staying in this beautiful Riad. About 5 minutes after we made the booking we received an email from Patrick and Caroline the owners asking us for our flight details (as they'd be picking us up from the airport) and would we like to order some dinner as we were arriving late. Every email after that was answered very promptly and everything was ""not a problem"".  When we arrived Isham was waiting for us at the airport. We were whisked away to the Dar El Bacha (the street). We walked down a short alley off the main pedestrian street and up to a large wooden door. Upon entering we found the most beautifully restored Riads (two made into one) that exceeded all expectations. Our room had been upgraded (for free) and was truly lovely with much needed aircon. The communal areas of the Riad were stunning: we spent a fair amount of time on the roof terrace only venturing downstairs to take a dip in one of the 2 plunge pools. We ate breakfast everyday on the roof. Breakfast consisted of more food than we could ever eat. We were served bread pastries orange juice coffee english (or Morrocan) tea fruit pancakes jams honey cheese yoghurt and more!! Mustafa carried this huge tray to our table everyday and made sure we had everything we needed. Just what you need to set you up for a mad day in the sooks and markets. Isham had hand-drawn us a map of the local area and the best routes into the Jeema El Fna (the main market).  The Riad is ideally placed for everything. It's a 1 minute walk out onto the main streets. Then 5 minutes to the main markets sooks and tourist spots. All the time you are passing beautiful shops and street sellers whilst trying to dodge the many mopeds that scoot past you as you walk!!  A few recommendations.....  1/ the cafe Arabe. It's a few minutes from the riad (Isham will draw it onto the map for you). The food is Morrocan and European. A welcome change from the Tagines and some lovely pasta for a vegetarian. The food is good but it's the roof terrace that makes this place. We booked on the afternoon as we walked home from the market. It's worth it to book a spot on the roof. We ate sat on lovely comfy sofas with lanterns hanging over the tables. Beautiful setting. There is a bar on the roof if you don't want to eat but fancy a beer in a great setting. We went back a few nights later to do just that!!  2/ The Comptoir restaurant in the new city. It's about a 20 minutes walk away (we walked back and got a taxi in). Great restaurant not cheap but not really expensive and well worth the visit. The food was amazing and we were treated to a proper belly dancing show right in the restaurant!  3/ Don't change any money in the UK. The exchange rate is about 10 Dirhams to the pound. It's about 13 in Marrakech. Isham will pinpoint a bureau de change on your map and it was always open and about 5 minutes from the Riad.  4/ At the top of the street to the Riad is a small kiosk with a picture the laughing cow logo above it. We bought water from here but my partner noticed that the top didn't appear to be intact and we wondered if the bottles were just filled with tap water. We weren't ill at all during our visit but we stayed away from ice in drinks brushed our teeth in bottled water and always made sure we had a bottle for drinks in the room. This seemed to work. I would buy water from one of the many other little shops and just make sure the seal in unbroken.  5/ Take comfy shoes and something to cover your shoulders with (ladies only!). Our guide book said no shorts but every tourist was wearing them. I tried to make sure my knees were covered and didn't take any short skirts or dresses. Everyone was so friendly and helpful during our stay apart from one very minor incident where we encountered a guide (a passerby who wants to show you to wherever you want to go for a fee). We tried to say that we were fine and I put my hand up to wave him away. He reacted to this by shouting the word ""woman"" and continuing to address my partner. We ignored him and walked away. He wasn' intimidating but it sets the tone for how some western women are viewed I think.  6/ As you leave the alleyway from the Riad you would turn left to head to the main areas. If you turn right there were a few shops with one we visited in particular. It was a shop full of tagines and ceramics. The prices are fixed so it's great if you don't like haggling or good for gauging prices so you know how much to pay if you want to try your hand at Marrakech negotiations! We did both!!  7/ There are cats everywhere in Marrakech. It's actually quite upsetting as mostly they are street cats and look in need of a good meal and a comfy bed. I'm an animal lover and a bit prone to letting these sights upset me. If you are the same prepare yourself. On the plus side the stall holders do seem to feed them and apparently there is a UK charity that is trying to help keep the population down.  I hope this review helps. We can't recommend this Riad highly enough. Thanks mainly to Patrick Caroline Isham Mustafa Dalalia and all of the other lovely members of staff that made our trip truly wonderful.",Date of stay: October 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Smethwick, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Angelcat18
Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,Paulo F wrote a review Oct 2011,50,One recommended spot in Marrakech,This was my third time in Marrakesh. First was 25 year ago during an 'Imperial cities' tour just 1 day here. Second was with a company event; 5 days in a 5 start hotel and quality entertainment through the stay. In both occasions going into the Medina was like leaving our western view of the world and stepping into something that was somewhat strange to us that you watch as an external observer.    Therefore this time I wanted to see it from the inside out. Find a nice hotel inside the medina have to find your way through the narrow alleys eventually get lost and from there come out to the streets. Believe me you see Marrakech with very different eyes I would say the right ones.    The riad was beautiiful the owners Caroline and Patrick very nice hosts who provided us with the essential what to do and how to move around. Mustafa was particularly helpful in every detail and requests. And the food was excellent (thank you Dalila for that and for the quick cooking course).    I don't know if I can be back once again in the future but I will surely recommend it to all my friends.

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,Jaymebh wrote a review Oct 2011,50,Phenomenal in Every Way!,"We just spent 9 glorious days in Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha Riad in mid-September and it far surpassed our every expectation! I began contact with Patrick the owner of the Riad back in March since I was bringing 11 people with me on a retreat to Marrakech. Every email I sent was promptly returned and everything I asked for was answered ""not a problem."" We rented out the entire Dar El Bacha side of the Riad (5 rooms) and 3 rooms in Trois Palmiers.    The Riad is located in a fantastic area of the old city called Dar El Bacha where there are wonderful antique stores and a fabulous Hammam called ""Hammam de la Rose"" just 2 minutes walking. We all walked day and night back and forth to the famous souk and Jemma El Fna square without any problem. With the hand-drawn map they provided it was easy. The Riad itself is beautiful and the pictures on the site don't do it justice. It's earthy very clean has beautiful tile work with stunning fountains lovely flora and fauna with sitting nooks everywhere to relax or be social. There were always fresh flowers in our rooms which all were decorated differently and made each room unique. The bathrooms and showers were great and the shampoo gel and lotions were some of the best I've ever smelled. The staff at the Riad were unparalleled and took care of our every need with such grace and kindness.    Our group had yoga classes on the roof amazing daily group breakfasts mint tea and pastries each afternoon and we had 2 dinners and 3 lunches there as well. The food is magnificent some of the best we had in all of Marrakech. Making sure that 11 people are well cared for was made much easier because of Patrick's help and the fantastic staff attention to every detail. I will definitely be going back there on my own as well as taking another group in the near future- Inshallah!

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,Kirstie G wrote a review Sep 2011,50,Introduction to Marrakech,My friend and I were fairly well travelled but had never been to Morocco. We had read lots of guide books but I still don't think I was really prepared for what Marrakech would be like. The roads were chaos and on entering the medina soon became too narrow to pass in a car. We unloaded our luggage into a handcart which was pushed down ever narrowing alleys full of donkeys souks with their salesmen and scooters until we stopped at a dark door. This door opened into an open courtyard with a deep pool and sunloungers. No matter how hot dusty and noisy it was outside the other side of that dark door it was always cool airy and quiet. In fact the only noise came from the other guests.  Our room was always clean and airy and we didn't need the aircon even in June. Getting the flow and temperature on the shower could be quite complicated but the free products were lovely.  We took our breakfast and sunbathed on the roof terrace which was luxurious with sunbeds towels straw hats and magazines. The view was amazing with rooftops and satelite dishes minarets and in the distance the Atlas mountains.  The staff took care to make sure we had instructions that made sure we could get to the landmarks and back without getting lost. They were always there but not obtrusive and served us beautiful breakfasts and a traditional evening meal. They also made excellent recommendations of places to go and the swallows at sunset on the roof of Cafe Arabe whilst drinking cocktails is pretty much unbeatable.  This is a well placed riad from which we did almst everything on our huge to do list without coming home exhausted. I would definitely stay here again either to visit Marrakech again or to use it as a base to travel further.,Date of stay: June 2011,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Manchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KirstieG_11

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,GiuseppeDeNinno wrote a review Sep 2011,50,Simply amazing!,I have been here only for one night during a business trip in spring time.  The location is perfect in the hearth of Marrakesh old city. This means you can get lost if you don't memoryze the street of your hotel! But this is something tipycal in Marrakesh!  When you entr just a small door you will find inside a wonderful tipycal riad with sevel floors a nice court with free internet.  Rooms are very nice it makes you think about how was a bedroom in the imperial Marrakesh! Bathrooms are the best part!  The only negative point is that the wook door and windows are not very well insulated: this is not a problem on summer but in winter is a little cold.  The rooms are very clean and the staff very well trained friendly end high-class.

The decor is lovely though simple and understated; breakfast was excellent and the staff will serve it whatever time you wish - the same goes for dinner.  The biggest plus about this riad is the staff. They really cannot do enough to help and genuinely seem to want you to feel at home here. We arranged a pick-up from the airport - I'd definitely recommend this as I don't think we would have found it on our own. Before we ventured out into the city one of the staff Hicham sat us down to give us some foolproof directions to the main sights of Marrakech - this was invaluable. The riad is well located - it's only a few minutes walk to the Djemaa el Fna square and the main souks. Any time we returned to the riad the staff were on hand and were keen to chat about where we'd been and how we were enjoying the city. Mint tea and Moroccan pastries were also provided!

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,TJDDevon wrote a review Sep 2011,50,Truly beautiful,Stayed at this riad for the last night of our Moroccan adventure - a touring holiday with our teenage son. Patrick the owner met us at the end of the road and led us to the riad down windy streets. Beautiful surroundings with attention to detail and a serene and calming atmosphere. Wish we had started our holiday here and spent more nights. We had the ground floor room which was plenty big enough for 3. May be a little noisy at busy times as sofas right ouside the 2 windows and also close to one of the breakfast areas but not a problem when we stayed. The roof terraces were truly beautiful with many plants. This riad is joined to the equally charming one next door. Plunge pool impressed our son as quite deep. No complaints at all but if we we were being really really picky the one thing we commented on was the jugs for milk water and coffee in the morning as they were not in keeping with the quality of the furnishings in the riad.

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,Global Dragon wrote a review Sep 2011,50,Great Riad!!!,We stayed at the Les Trois Palmiers for 3 nights and we changed two rooms while there. The first one (Beldi) was quite small but very nicely furnished and the second one (Koutoubia) was fabulous! Lovely bathroom (massive bath) great ceiling and comfy bed.    The Riad as you can read from other reviews is on a dark and dingy hallway and so the first impressions are not the best. Once you get used to it though you realize that Marrakech is like that everywhere and it is quite safe. We had no issue with safety and the staff were really helpful on advising us what to do and where to go.    I loved the style it is really tastefully done both courtyards are really pretty and tranquil. The food was great they accommodate us at the last minute and they prepare a fantastic dinner. Breakfast on the roof was lovely; everyday we had different Moroccan food and continental food so it was a great mix.    I would definitely recommend it to everybody who is willing to explore Marrakesh and looking for a almost authentic experience in the Medina.,Date of stay: May 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,UK/Italy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Definitelygio2

This is one of the best places we have ever stayed the staff were absolutely fantastic polite friendly and very helpful. In particular a man called Mustapha who welcomed us on our first night and drew us a brilliant map that stopped us from getting lost! Breakfast was lovely lots of variety fruit pastries jam cheese etc. and home made yogurt that was delicious. Our sheets and room were cleaned and changed every day and the whole place is immaculate. Beautiful decor - everything is of the highest standard and all local crafts have been employed in the decoration.  On a night this riad was very quiet but if you are a very light sleeper take some ear plugs wherever you are in Morocco to avoid being woken by the call to prayer.

We ate a couple of dinners and lunches in the riad and we recommend those as well. The breakfast is excellent especially the yoghurt. The staff is very friendly and took a good care of us.

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,Samkirk9 wrote a review Jun 2011,50,Genuine friendliness and hospitality... you can't buy that sort of service,I only found out I was off to Marrakech a week before I was going so had no time to do my usual research of somewhere to stay. So a surprise trip the Riad had been chosen and I wasn‚Äôt disappointed. Right from the start the staff were outstanding. My bag had been left at Gatwick but Pat the Riad owner was soon on the case and although he couldn‚Äôt make it get to Morocco any quicker he made a call to a guy he knew at Air Maroc which meant that my details were taken quickly and we could all get to the Riad.  We approached the Riad down winding alleyways that we wondered how we would get out of (Left Left Right and a hand drawn map from Hicham!!) stopping off for a look in the local bakery on the way and finally being welcomed by staff with sweets and Moroccan tea. No time to waste Pat showed us around his lovingly restored Riad with photo‚Äôs on the wall traditional furniture and descriptions of the painstaking creative detail of the making of the mosaic in the Palm filled courtyard behind the plunge pool.  We were taken into each room but one had a young Muslim couple in there which I felt shouldn‚Äôt be disturbed. But Pat ushered us in only to my utter surprise and amazement to find that this couple were my friends!! My partner had been arranging this trip for seven months and Pat and his staff made sure that they added to the surprise: they had acquired some traditional Muslim dress for my friends to dress up in!  We then toured the three flights of stairs with rooms off the inner courtyard as Pat led us each to our rooms. They were all beautiful with nice touches of fruit flowers and petals scattered on the bed as well as wall hangings artefacts and rugs and amazing bathrooms. They had also allowed my friends in to decorate the room with birthday paraphernalia. And so it went on‚Ä¶.  We had the whole Riad to ourselves and we were told to treat it as our home which the thirteen of us did. Breakfast was served on the terrace and each day we had fresh bread from the local bakery yoghurt honey jams fruit cheese a variety of teas and coffee and each day something different such as pancakes donuts and crumpets.  We were waited on by the staff who were more than just polite ‚Äì they were positively friendly genuine and remembered our names as well as being able to have a laugh and a joke with us. They never once seemed to tire over our endless requests for drinks (up three flights of stairs) ‚Äì even in the early hours of the morning as our festivities continued and I really thank them for that as other places may not have treated us so well.  I also thank them for the effort they put into my birthday meal. To start with there were drinks and nibbles on the terrace as I opened my presents and cards followed by a meal for us all in the courtyard. The table setting was brilliant (Pat had to stop me walking in on the staff setting it so as not to spoil the surprise) a little gift left for each of us the great food lovingly prepared by the ladies in the kitchen who came out for an applause at the end the wine flowed and everyone had a great time and then the lights were dimmed when they brought out my birthday cake. I was well and truly spoilt not just by my friends but by Pat and the staff at the hotel.  I would wholeheartedly recommend this Riad and aside from my very subjective view it‚Äôs location is also good only a 10 minute walk to the square with restaurants and bars along the way. Coming back after the heat traffic and souks to this Riad was truly welcoming ‚Äì a tranquil and serene place in the middle of the medina which made it very hard for you to leave at times as you had everything you needed there. Sunbeds adorned the top terrace and we were waited on for all our needs and a plunge pool in the courtyard meant that cooling off wasn‚Äôt an issue after a few hours in the sun. Pat even got a driver to take me back to the airport to collect my late baggage. This place really knows how to treat its guests with genuine friendliness and hospitality and you can‚Äôt buy that sort of service.  Thank you Pat Mustafa Hicham Haled and all the staff at Riad Les Trois Palmiers ‚Äì you made my birthday five days very special.,Date of stay: May 2011,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Samkirk9
Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,jules231 wrote a review Jun 2011,50,"Perfect Hotel, faultless in every way!",Myself and two girlfriends went for a 4 night stay to Marrakech on 5th June and stayed at this Riad.    Upon arrival in Marrakech it was pretty much as I had anticpated with the traffic different modes of transport (and ways of driving). There were carts donkeys horse and carriages cars motor bikes (among others) driving any direction they pleased and moreso on the pavements!!............ quite funny when you look back!    The approach to the Riad is very weird in that it is just dirty alleyway after dirty alleyway all meandering in different directions. If it werent for Isha coming to meet and greet us and take us we would definitely not have found it. Albeit when we did approach the alleyway to where the riad's two front doors were I was a little apprehensive. But oh my goodness when that large wooden door opened there were smells of yasmin orange and incense wafting through the door. I couldnt believed what I was walking in to. It was like a sanctuary a spa a haven of tranquility!    We were shown around the hotel and to our room. We had a triple room (being 3 girls) and there was ample space in the room for us all. The bathroom was adequate with plenty of lovely hot water and bathrobes if we wanted them.    On the second evening we ate at the Riad. The food was really lovely beautifully presented served and cooked and very reasonably priced 22euro pp for a three course meal.    We were told by the people who worked there constantly to treat this as our home and to be honest we felt like it was our home for the time we stayed there.    If I do go back to Marrakech I will almost definitely stay at this hotel. The staff are without doubt the most attentive generous and genuinely kind people I have ever come across in any stay in any country in the world. Caroline and Patrick are very lucky they have such wonderful staff!!

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,AbidinginHim wrote a review Jun 2011,50,"Great location, very hospitable staff",My husband and I stayed here for four nights. The rooms are decorated nicely and the bed is comfortable. I would recommend earplugs for light sleepers. The other guests retired a little later than we did so there was some noise during the night. The breakfast included: fresh orange juice coffee or tea pastries homemade yogurt fresh fruit and bread with butter and jam.  Mustafa was very hospitable and helpful in recommending sights to see restaurants etc. He even drew us a detailed map so we wouldn't get lost. Thankfully we did have help finding the place. The people in Marrakesh are very friendly and more than willing to help you find your way if you happen to get lost. I highly recommend staying at the Riad Les Trois Palmiers.  Driving in the Old City was like a scene from an Indiana Jones movie. We didn't spend any time outside of the Old City except to drive from the Casa Blanca airport to Marrakesh and one time to drive around the city wall. Consequently we found our rental car to be very unnecessary especially since we could have flown directly into Marrakesh. The airport is just 7 miles away.  Lastly this Riad as well as most restaurants (Cafe Arabe was an exception) and vendors accept only cash payment.,Date of stay: May 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"San Diego, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AbidinginHim

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,golizzer wrote a review Jun 2011,50,Magical,I was here in November on a mother daughter trip to Marrakech. Staying at this riad completely made our trip. Everyone from the chef in the kitchen to the driver who led us into the riad for the first time treated us like family. Our room was well appointed and was carefully taken care of every day. The riad itself is beautiful and the owners have some very entertaining stories about how they remodeled and designed it from the ground up.    The best part of our stay was having breakfast on the terrace each morning and watching the sun rise over the city. While a bit confusing to find at first soon we were navigating the derb to the riad like locals and always felt extremely safe comfortable and welcome. We also had a very memorable meal there under the 3 palms which was delicious. The next day we were invited to the kitchen to learn how it was prepared which was just as exciting as any cooking lesson. This is a very special place a true home away from home in a magical city!,Date of stay: November 2010,Trip type: Traveled with family,"San Francisco, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/golizzer

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,TravelPad wrote a review Jun 2011,50,A great 5 days spent in a quality riad,We came here to celebrate my partners 40th birthday and stayed in Les Trios Palmiers for 5 nights. There were 13 in total in our party and we were made to feel very welcome indeed. Pat the owner came to the airport to collect some of the party and gave us some info about Marrakech as we headed to the riad which made us feel welcomed and relaxed.    The riad is located off a busy thorough-fare and down a couple of shabby looking alleyways which you get used to very quickly. Things suddenly change however once you get through the entrance door of the riad. You enter an ornate courtyard which has a small pool to one side and traditional seating areas in the open and in the smaller rooms to each side. A feeling of tranquillity descends once inside. The riad consists of 3 levels with an open terrace on the top floor (there is no roof). The first floor is where most of the rooms are with an additional two on the top and another one on the ground floor. The open terrace on the top is where we all took breakfast everyday as a group but I imagine this could be taken in the ground floor courtyard if requested. Breakfast was a continental affair with orange juice tea (English & Moroccan) coffee pastries yoghurt and fresh fruit. The bread rolls were from the bakery down the nearby alley ‚Äì very fresh.    There are also several sun beds on the roof terrace area and for those serious sun worshipers there was a final mini roof terrace right at the very top of the building up some steep wooden steps.    Detail is everything here and you see it in all aspects of the renovation. From mosaic tiles to authentic fixtures and fittings doors windows and ornate furnishings - lots of things have been meticulously thought about. Its not only the detail of the building that‚Äôs been thought about attention to guests needs seems to be the ethos of this establishment.    As there were 13 in our group we had ‚Äòexclusive‚Äô use of the entire riad and the staff were very accommodating to all our requests many of which involved ordering drinks late at night on the roof terrace. Our initiation into the riad was a tour of all the rooms and some history about its renovation from Pat which was followed by traditional mint tea for all. This was followed by a lesson in orientation of the local area using hand drawn maps from Hicham.    For the birthday celebrations I‚Äôd arranged a meal in the riad. Half the party were vegetarian and this wasn‚Äôt a problem for them to organise. The staff also added some nice touches as well by placing a gift for each member of the party at the table. Celebrations went on later after that and Mustafa was happy to keep pouring the wine and bringing beer throughout the evening. Not sure how much noise was made but having exclusive use of all the riad meant that we didn‚Äôt disturb other guests. The other riad (El Bacha) is next door and can be accessed via Les Trois Palmiers but we generally stayed in Trois Palmiers.    Overall the general consensus by all who came was that we‚Äôd stayed in an excellent well run friendly quality riad. All the rooms were of a high standard and were clean tidy and comfortable with different individual touches in each one. A definite recommendation for couples and groups alike and a memorable place for a birthday celebration.,Date of stay: May 2011,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelPad

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,Dimitrije56 wrote a review May 2011,40,"Fantastic riad, real luxury, with a dissapointment in the end",Absolutely great riad fantastic Moroccan architecture and interior design. A lot of style at every single point giving a feeling of pleasure all the time. Beautiful room (ours) going directly into the patio great roof terrace where the excellent breakfast was served (except one day when the weather was not good). Very romantic dinner highly recommended. Location is OK about 10-15 minutes walk from Jemma El Fna. Staff very freindly (Moustafa was our favourite Hirsham also very good)  EXCEPT  that in the end offered to arrange a taxi and completely unnecessary and very disappointingly tried to earn couple of euros on us as the guests. For a taxi to the train station which is with the meter less than Dr 10 and without certainly not more than Dr20 (we took it several times) one of the staff arranged in a hurry to get it for Dr 70!!! Not really about money but about feeling of being cheated. Could have expected that from a taxi driver or anybody in the street but not from until then a very professional and nice staff. Even worse before taking taxi we were asked to stand behind a little truck in the street - we hoped this should serve to protect us from taxi charging much from obvious foreigners but instead it was the way to arrange with the taxi driver to charge more and probably divide later. Shameful!  However apart from this bad episode which left the bitter taste in the end the rest was really perfect and therefore the riad deserves to be very highly recommended.,Date of stay: April 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Belgrade, Serbia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dimitrije56

From the moment you arrive until you leave the Riad the staff accommodate your every need. My wife and I recently spent five nights at the Riad and couldn't have been more pleased with the service provided by the entire staff especially Irsham and Mustafa. After having a flight cancelled due to a protest/strike by Royal Air Maroc these gentlemen welcomed us back to the riad without a reservation and worked feverishly to help us resolve our issues and book a new flight for the next day. The Riad is the picture of relaxation and tranquility just a few blocks from the hustle and bustle of the souks. The rooms are comfortable and decorated in traditional Moroccan trim. The staff provide excellent recommendations about sights/ restaurants/events to enjoy.

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,lufa wrote a review Apr 2011,30,"good, but nothing exceptional (as many people seem to believe)","Besides a minority of guests I see a real waste of superlative adjectives for this riad. And actually I selected it for the expectional wonders described here on tripadvisor but after having seen the riad and lived there...well I do not know whether these people is ingenuous or has hearing and/or olfaction problems or simply gets enchanted by some stylish piece of furniture. Probably most people tends to convince themselves that they had an incomparable vacation in any case. I do not want ti be misunderstood: the riad is very good from many point of views first of all the rich breakfast the kindness of the staff and the position but absolutely out of standard (talking about quality/price ratio) from other points of view. Which ones? For instance our bathroom emanated an intense sewer stink (and it was not a matter of the days I stayed there since there was an electric perfume permanently plugged in the wall socket) that reached the sleeping area the shower sink did not work properly the blankets were never changed in 6 days (and were not exactly snow-white). But the most annoying for us was the noise made by the other guests after dinner: we never managed to close our eyes before 12.30 AM: laughs and screams of excited guests (probably those that then write excellent reviews) in one case lasted until 1 AM without that nobody invited them to keep quiet (or to go back to Jemaa el Fna). And sometimes the show started again in the morning when some guest decided to have breakfast in the court at 8 AM (not exactly the top after having been waked up by the muezzin at 5.30 AM - but this is just normal). I understand that hearing other people is unavoidable in a structure like that of a riad but exactly for this reason the owners should impose clear and simple rules to be absolutely respected by their guests. I was in similar structures and this did not happen and it is not a matter of higher standard but of good sense. After two nigths I explained the situation to one of the guys of the staff and he told me that the guests were invited to keep silence after 11 PM but the night after the show continued. I thought I had reached a solution after having talked directly to one of the most screaming ladies but evidently other guests joined that same day to make my effort vain. And the truth is that I was not advised of this ""rule of silence"" when I checked in so I guess nobody is. Concerning the terrace it is really very beautiful. But please people do not exaggerate: other three friends of ours were in Marrakech in those same days in other riads in central position so we could visit their places. They spent less than us and in their terraces they could even had a bath in a sort of Jacuzzi. In conclusion I believe this is a nice and comfortable riad but really overrated: if you want stay here at all costs probably the best choice in terms of quality/price ratio is asking for the cheapest (and smallest) rooms on the roof that are likely also those less affected by noise.",Date of stay: February 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Florence, Italy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lufa

Ours was very comfortable and fitted out in Moroccan style. The staff are really delightful. Breakfast was served on the rooftop terrace.

It was such a pleasure to arrive back at the Riad each day. Birds were singing and flying around in the courtyard the plunge pool and palms give it an exotic and tranquil atmosphere and the many different rooms mean you can have your own space if you want it.

The owners a french couple called Patrick and Caroline who speak perfect English- have created a perfect balance of the personal touch while allowing you the freedom to feel relaxed and at home during your stay. They were on-hand when you needed them as well as being very friendly and informative. Stepping through the origionally featured door from the dark alleyways into an Oasis of beauty and taste. The staff were all friendly nothing seemed a problem for them- as if they are honered to serve you. They can give you information of the local areas- provide maps hints and tips. Breakfast can be served to you where ever you wish. We had freshly squeezed juice coffee a variety of croisants breads pancakes yoghurt and fresh fruit. We had ours on the lovely roof top terrace or alternativly there are many 'alcoves' and rooms- some comfortable and others opulent. The room we stayed in was breath-taking with tasteful decoration high ceilings a very large comfortable bed.here was plenty of storage space for clothes and provided clothes hangers and a hairdryer. I travelled with my husband and we did not want to come home. I would recommend this to anyone. The only problem would be if you cannot manage stairs- unless you requested a ground floor room.

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,Squidsey wrote a review Mar 2011,50,Perfectly located haven of tranquillity in the heart of the Medina,My boyfriend and I stayed at Riad Les Trois Palmiers for 3 nights. We were so glad we chose this riad out of the hundreds available! It is very conveniently located near both Jamaa el Fna and the maze of souks and it is easy to find once you have been there once (walk down Dar El Bacha from the taxi drop-off turn left down Derb Tizougarine [which is spelt differently - watch out!] Then take the second left then second right. It is either of the first two doors on your right on the same street as Riad Dalia.) I felt very safe in this area even late at night.    The place itself was wonderful. Look at the pictures and you'll get a good idea of what the Riad looks like. Open spaces filled with natural light beautiful Moroccan decor terraces that were made for sun lounging and separate living rooms on the ground floor where you can watch a DVD if it takes your fancy. There's plenty to do in Marrakech but if you are staying for a while I imagine it would be a nice change to chill out indoors with a good film.    The rooms are nicely decorated. Our room which was on the top floor was well worth the money and had everything we needed including a private terrace. We got the cheapest room available (¬£225 for 3 nights) but the rooms on the ground floor looked amazing and spacious - if you can splash out a bit more I'd go for one of those. The only problem I can envisage is the the ground floor rooms surround the dining area which could potentially be a little noisy at dinnertime and breakfast time. However from the looks of it the doors are thick and probably block out most of it and the Riad was never noisy when we were there We only ever really heard the occasional tinkling of cutlery.    Service was impeccable - our hosts were amazing and catered to our every need bringing us complimentary mint tea and little pastries if we wanted them. Breakfast was perfectly sized and varied (fresh fruit pancakes pastries yoghurt tea freshly squeezed orange juice).    The beds were very comfortable and we always got a good nights' sleep - however if you are a light sleeper you may get woken up very briefly by the early morning prayer call which can be heard all over Marrakech and most likely in every Riad. The only other thing is that one of the 'private' terraces is adjacent to the drying lines so staff often come in and out to hang up laundry which can be distracting. Saying that though there are plenty of other terraces to choose from!    Next time I go to Marrakech I will definitely come to stay here again. Riad Les Trois Palmiers has hundreds of good reviews for a reason!,Date of stay: March 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Squidsey
Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,HDCM85 wrote a review Mar 2011,50,Best. Weekender. Ever.,I would stay here again in a heartbeat. The staff picked us up from the airport and from there on it was clear sailing. The Riad is located in the heart of the Medina and the souks are only a couple of streets away (frankly with all the chat you get in the souks I wouldn't have wanted to stay any closer)! Breakfasts were consistently fine and served either in the atrium or on the rooftop terrace and whenever you emerge from your room. The staff hand-drew a map for us and made sure we knew where we were and how to get back there-- a tougher trick than you might think! Caroline the owner showed us on a map the must-see spots and she certainly wasn't wrong. The food was FANTASTIC-- if you stay here have dinner in at least one night. The ever-present hospitality of Moroccan mint tea was delightful the service clean and friendly and everyone really strove to be helpful. I was with two other friends but I'd feel comfortable staying here by myself. The rates were super reasonable. If you're thinking of getting henna while in Marrakesh arrange it through the Riad-- the woman they have on retainer is BRILLIANT! You won't find an artiste of her caliber in the square and the cost is simply added on to your bill.,Date of stay: March 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Aberdeen, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HDCM85
Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,dg500 wrote a review Mar 2011,50,Perfect,This tastefully restored riad was perfect. The rooms are beautifully appointed with high quality Moroccan artisan fittings and furniture. The interior public spaces were equally refined and the roof terrace is fabulous. The staff could not have been more welcoming and helpful. It was a real oasis of tranquility amid the hubbub of the madina. Do contact the hotel in advance of your arrival and they will arrange to guide you through the alleyways to the hotel - it would be difficult to find unaided.,Date of stay: March 2011,,"Wiltshire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dgray500
Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,TravelingCaravan1 wrote a review Mar 2011,50,Warm hospitality in beautiful setting,The staff was wonderful here. The owner Patrick was especially helpful in helping us to navigate Marrakech and to plan our next destination in Morocco. The riad is extremely clean and the breakfast of fresh breads juices and homemade yogurt was fantastic. The riad is located centrally within the old city and is a short walk to the main square.

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,Dragonlady15 wrote a review Mar 2011,30,Has potential,If I could give this place a 3.5 rating I would. But trip advisor doesn't give that option and they weren't quite a 4. Truth be told i usually try to pick one of the top five tripadvisor hotels but due to my very late planning choices 1-10 were already booked. The location was fine- not as close to the souks as I may have liked but really not far either. The main facilities are truly lovely- everything you would envision of a romantic Moroccan riad. The food was good- the kitchen staff was impressive as a whole. I was unimpressed with my room and bathroom- it left me wishing I'd planned ahead for a nicer place- I'm always willing to pay a little more for comfort. The decor was nothing like the photos and the first night I  was freezing despite cranking up the heater. The owner did notice at the end up my stay that they had accidentally placed me in the wrong type of room- and I thought it was very cool of him to point this out and adjust the price. It's not like I would have known any better. Service was also spotty. Sometimes the staff seemed so nice and other times I was irritated. Examples- I had been told by the owner that I could pay with credit card. But the staff member who checked me in very pointedly told me I cannot pay with credit card. I told him I had the email right there on my iPad and he actually looked skeptical and made me show it to him! Seriously? If I tell you I have talked to the owner then just go check with the owner! Of course I then checked with the owner and he did apologize and confirmed that credit card is ok. He explained that credit card services are sketchy there- and he is right. Credit card machines often don't work in Africa. I once got asked by a major hotel in Tanzania if I could please pay them $1000 cash. A second example of questionable service- The first night I ate at the riad I asked if could sit at the table closest to the pool and the staff actually refused stating that they had already set two place settings at that table. Is it THAT hard to move a plate and cup over to the other table to make your guest happy? I was given the table that faced a bunch of trees instead. I overheard the owner talking to a nearby table that night and he said he really cares about what guests have to say. If that is  the case what I would suggest is to work out these kinks. Don't list on all the major hotel booking sites that you take credit cards and then have the staff telling people you don't take credit cards. Perhaps you could train the staff on consistent service. The same man from the table incident was actually really nice the rest of the time I was there. I actually think that everyone there means well. I am picky because I have traveled pretty much everywhere and stayed at most types of hotels. This one has potential- but as it stands I left not feeling quite happy.,Date of stay: March 2011,Trip type: Traveled solo,"New York City, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dragonlady15
Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,eoireitum wrote a review Mar 2011,40,A nice weekend stay,This Riad is very nice inside with good food and excellent staff. I would suggest that you take up the Riads offer of a pick up from the airport as even Google earth would not help you find it. It is indeed down a serious of alleyways with no signage whatsoever not even on the Riads front door.  It is very close to the main square and within easy walking distance of many of the main attractions.

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,Lilybenk wrote a review Mar 2011,50,Couldn't have asked for more!,We stayed in the Riad in February this year we took our teenage daughter.  The Riad was fabulous! not in a 5 star luxury kind of way but warm welcoming traditional comfortable clean.  We were worried to say the least when we initially arrived we didn't realise that the entrance to the Riad was down a series of allyways until we arrived at a door in the ally wall. We would never have found this if we had arrived alone thank goodness for the transfer provided by the Riad.  A system of 'rights and lefts' allowed us to come and go quite easily after that.  The staff couldn't do enough for us the evening meal on the first night was traditional and really nice.  We had breakfast on the rooftop and relaxed there late afternoon while Ahled and Hicham were perfect waiters we wanted for nothing.  We had a trip to the Atlas mountains Hicham was our guide well worth the trip.

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,Caroline T wrote a review Mar 2011,50,Truly wonderful!,My husband daughter and I stayed for one night in this fantastic Riad. From the minute we arrived we were shown such courtesy by the staff - to begin with a Moroccan tea from Khalid followed by a guided tour of the Riad by Hischam and it was impressed upon us that we should treat it like our own home. After sightseeing we returned in the early evening and sat up on the roof terrace where we were served drinks followed by a delicious meal.  We found the whole experience very welcome and calming after the extremely busy and crowded streets of Marrakech and were only sorry that we couldn't have stayed longer.  All in all a brilliant experience - I would certainly recommend it to anyone and if we visit Marrakech again all three of us said we would definitely choose to stay there.,Date of stay: March 2011,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Winchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarolineET
Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,ClaireD_10 wrote a review Mar 2011,40,So so relaxing...,I recently stayed here for two nights with a friend. We are both young females and found are stay brilliant! We were greeted by a very friendly Isham who collected us from our taxi and carried our bags to the Riad. He then gave us a very detailed tour of the Riad and made us feel extremely welcome and at ease. We found everything to be very clean and well organised and all the staff extremely friendly. Our only criticism would be that the staff were unable to recommend a good place to eat!!.. perhaps this was because they would like us to eat within the Riad! So advise would be to research places before you get to Marrakech. I say this because we had a particularly average meal in a restaurant near the big square and this was a shame because we were only there for two nights and both of us enjoy and appreciate good food!    All the reviews on here are very accurate- i wouldn't disagree with any of the most recent ones.

Riad Les Trois Palmiers was perfect from start to finish - from the lovely man who collected us from the airport with a big smile and warm handshake the friendly Isham who gave us a guided tour around the riad and told us about the city the lovely waiters who served us our delicious breakfast (fresh bread fruit homemade yoghurt) and the very friendly owners Patrick and Caroline who welcomed us as their guests. The riad is ideally located in the Medina within walking distance of all the main sights.

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,TwoPugs wrote a review Mar 2011,50,All the other review are right - it IS excellent,We came to Marrakesh to escape the freezing Swedish winter and the warmth of the welcome and service at Riad Les Trois Palmiers were the perfect antidote.  Truth be told we stayed a week in Marrakesh and that was a couple days too many. Having taken a day trip to the charming coastal town of Essouria (a couple or so hours away) with the benefit of hindsight we would recommend spending 4-5 days in Marrakesh combined with 2-3 days in Essouria - a perfect combination.  But back to the Riad. All the reviews extolling the place are a bit repetitive but the praise is totally justified. The place is beautiful the location excellent (a mere 10 minutes' walk from the main square) and the proprietors and their staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful; it's perhaps unfair to single out anyone but special praise must go to Mustapha who also makes the most delicious honey. We had ordered half board and thus had our evening meals at the Riad. One of us (who likes Moroccan food) thought the meal were wonderful; the other - a finicky eater at the best of times - decided he didn't like the flavours of Moroccan cuisine and thus his view doesn't help as guidance. But even he agreed that the tiny meatballs served in a tomato sauce with eggs poached in the sauce was superb!  Finaly three criticisms:  1. the hot water in the shower was a bit erratic and sometimes only lukewarm;  2. it seems a bit cheap that the only cheese offered at the otherwise very enjoyable breakfast comprised triangles of processed cheese;  3. it is a great pity that there is no non-smoking policy in the Riad; with access to the wonderful roof terrace surely that would be room enough for the smokers. In this context the main polluter was probably the otherwise charming proprietress Caroline.  To close despite these criticisms the Riad is a wonderful place and highly recommended.,Date of stay: February 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Stockholm,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TwoPugs

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,Tillygirl wrote a review Feb 2011,50,Wonderful Experience,We arrived on 28 Dec 2010 for a four day stay and could not recommend it more it is in an ideal position for visiting all the sights. The rooms are lovely and so are the staff although we do not speak hardly any French we had no problems the owner Patrick and all the staff were great. We highly recommend eating in the riad the food was good and great value and if you like to drink alcohol with your meal it is ideal as a lot of the local restaurants do not serve it. For NY Eve they laid on a gala meal with local singers + a belly dancer  we were expecting to be a bit left out due to not speaking French but instead we really enjoyed the evening Patrick and his family and a couple from Brazil sat with us and we chatted and laughed until the early hours on the NY. I can recommend  Cafe de France for people watching and if you like to drink the upstairs bar of Cafe Arabe do nice snacks and a decent bottle of wine for about ¬£15. Try Narwarma Thai restaurant if you want a change just off of the main square near the Koutoubia but it is a bit pricy . We also had a spa day at Les Bains de Marrakech which again was a great experience but also pricy although they same treatments would have been far more expensive in the UK. Recommend Marrakech and this Riad to anyone and will visit again soon.,Date of stay: December 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tillygirl
Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,pj1969 wrote a review Jan 2011,50,Highly recommended.,Our four night stay included transfers which were very welcome and negated the hassle of taxis and buses. We were dropped near the riad to be met by Mustapha who led us through the alleyways. At this time we wondered what we'd let ourselves in for but were absolutely delighted with what we found upon stepping through the door. Patrick (the owner) met us and took his time giving us a guided tour of the riad explaining it's history. He also recommended some places to visit the best advice being to sit upstairs at the Cafe France watching the world go by in the main square. We were worried about finding our way through the souks so the personal touch continued with a hand drawn map. Our room was perfect (we'd booked a room but were upgraded free of charge due to the place being so busy). We opted for evening meals at the raid too. These were mainly traditional Moroccan meals and not always to my liking but generally very tasty. All in all we'd happily recommend this riad to anyone looking for our opinion.

A transfer was organised through the Hotel who took as far as we could go by car where we were met by a member of staff who walked us in the rest of the way through some small dark alleys to the Riad door . Best way i could describe it is Tardis ! what a contrast  Patrick explained later that the Morrocan way is not to display ones wealth but behind the Riad door is a true Gem . Best place we have ever stayed on any holiday.step out the hotel door and your in the heart of the old city souks and medina . Go up to the roof terrace and you look over the city soak up the sun dine al fresco but it's so peaceful bar the ocassional call to prayer. The Riad is immaculately clean  staff can't do enough for you  and make you feel so welcome  all rooms are beautifully decorated and comfortable . Could go on and on but best thing for us to say is just go you will be so well looked after . the only negative we can think of is the bath water drained away a bit slow !!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Date of stay: January 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Swindon, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fredbikerski

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,Greavester wrote a review Jan 2011,50,Super Duper 3 Night Stay!,The best thing about Riad Les Trois Palmiers was the warm welcome that we got as soon as we arrived. Super friendly staff who couldn't do enough to help you and make you feel comfortable relaxed and completely 'at home'. The location is excellent as it's only a 5 minute walk from the main square but far enough away from the hustle and bustle to make an ideal place to relax. We couldn't quite get over how peaceful it was sitting having our delicious breakfast in the gorgeous courtyard on the first morning.    Our room was smallish but adequate and was positioned on the roof of the Riad which often meant we had the whole of the fantastic rooftop terrace to ourselves! Just like the rest of the Riad our room was beautifully decorated in a traditional style which added to the feeling of a 'real' moroccan experience. It was also extremely clean and our beds were made each day.    Mustapha very kindly gave us a guided tour of the Riad on our first day and it was great to learn about all of the renovations that had been carried out. He also drew us a map of the local area which we definitely would have been lost without and give us some sound advice on the best places to visit. The owners Patrick and Catherine also gave us some excellent recommendations on restaurants bars and clubs - we had a really great night out as a result! And as two young females in Marrekech we felt very safe walking back to the Riad at night.    As suggested in other reviews we would recommend using the Riad airport shuttle service rather than a local taxi. It was very reasonable and we would have really struggled to find the Riad without it. Plus it makes things much easier when arriving at the airport late at night.

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,Sarah L wrote a review Nov 2010,50,Beautiful relaxing expierience,I cannot recommend this riad highly enough. Mustaffa was the most kind gentle natured polite and helpful person I have ever encountered in my life and I have done a lot of travelling. He draws every guest a map which is essential in order to find the riad again as there are no 'street' signs inside the medina walls. I would definitely recommend getting an airport pick up which we didn't as we arrived in Marrakech by coach. I should make it very clear that a taxi cannot take you there and we would have been stranded with no idea how to get there if it wasn't for the locals who showed us where it was. Be aware though they will expect a cash payment in return. The rooms are stunning with high class finishes and gorgeous designs. The riad was relaxing and clean and after 2 weeks of terrible hotels and service across the country this place was a god send. My only complaint would be that there was no seal to the room in that there was a 5cm gap between the wall of the room and the door so you could hear noise coming from the outside. Despite this you should not hesitate to book this riad.,Date of stay: October 2010,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Perth, Australia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarahl0uise
Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,Clara A wrote a review Nov 2010,50,Amazing place to stay in Marrakech,"My boyfriend and I visited Morocco for the first time just two weeks ago. Prior to going it was recommended we stay in a Riad in Marrakech to get the ""true"" Moroccan experience. After reading the amazing reviews of Riad Les Trois Palmiers online I decided to book our stay there. I could say a million wonderful things about this riad and how wonderful our stay was there- but a few key things stick out. First the medina of Marrakech and Morocco in general is a unique place to navigate the staff at the Riad are so knowledgeable and helpful they truly made a difference in our ability to explore the city. Having a ride from the airport is crucial- our plane was delayed an hour and our driver was still there waiting for us. The riad is immaculate our rooms were refreshed beautifully every day- the place looked pristine. The complimentary breakfasts in the morning are one of the highlights- they serve until 11 am it's such a relaxing dining experience. The riad itself is very centrally located making it easy to see all the sights. Lastly during your stay- be sure to spend lots of time on the roof top terrace- day and night it's just wonderful!",Date of stay: November 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Arlington, Virginia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/claraa37

There is no ""restaurant"" per se but there are meals available as you'd imagine at a Bed & Breakfast with a chef on the premises who will cook up a meal for any group with sufficient notice to make it to the market in time. Ingredients are farm fresh and absolutely locally sourced. I was treated with delectable tagines and couscous house-made pastries and mint tea at every turn. Breakfast is included and I enjoyed lunch and dinners there as well. This was the perfect spot to recharge my batteries for a couple days and explore the medina before heading out with friends on a longer adventure tour of Morocco.

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,citybreaker3 wrote a review Nov 2010,40,A real gem in the hussle and bustle of the Marrakech Souks,During our 5 day stay we started our trip off by pre arranging to be picked up from the airport by the Riad driver Abdul this is a hightly recommended. We were dropped off near the riad where one of the staff members took us on a short walk through the hustle and bustle sights and sounds to the riad. Without this service you will not find the place as it is down a few dark alleyways and signposting is rare in morocco.  Maps and guide book routes will mean nothing in the souks but the riad owner Patrick will draw one that will get you to all the main sights to see keeping things simple. (if you do stray off his map route have some Dirhams handy as the local guides will want paying). The riad is in a great location and Patrick can arrange day trips to the Atlas mountains and other attractions.  The service at the riad is of a very high standard and the staff are friendly and extremely hospitable. We had a few meals at the riad and they were of a high standard you dont get a menu but will get told what each course is. Breakfast can be had in the main court yard or on the roof terrace and is very good to start the day with!  We had one of the smaller rooms but it was comfortable and well decorated and being on the roof terrace we had loads of space to enjoy the sun outside. Overall we had a great stay and highly recommend this riad as mentioned before by other reviewers they dont take credit/debit cards so you have to pay by cash or do an internet transfer.,Date of stay: November 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/citybreaker3

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,DanielleDrainey wrote a review Nov 2010,50,The perfect place to stay if it's your first trip to Marrakech....,We were picked up at the airport by a friendly driver who dropped us as near as possible to our riad. We were then escorted to the riad down some winding dark alleys to an unassuming door. Inside was a fabulous courtyard and a welcome reception we were given a guided tour of the riad including the roof terrace and given a bit of the history of the house followed by mint tea and then we were shown to our lovely clean traditional looking room with a beautiful ensuite bathroom and stained glass windows over the courtyard    The hotel manager Patrick gave us information about the best places to visit eat and enjoy the atmosphere of the city and it was good advice!    Breakfast was served wherever you wanted to have it on the terrace or courtyard by the ever friendly and helpful staff and consisted of freshly made pancakes/pastries fruit and breads.    You are also able to eat dinner at the riad if you book in advance and you are even allowed in the kitchen for a cooking lesson and help prepare dinner.    It was a very relaxing place to rest and unwind between trips to the hectic souks and the fun of the main square.

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,horacethefrog wrote a review Nov 2010,50,"Lovely riad, lovely people. I'd be really, really surprised if you can find better than this",The riad is actually two interconnected riads each in a different style and located only a few minutes walk from the souks and Jemaa El F'na. They have been beautifully restored by the current owners Caroline and Patrick. We had one of the two rooms on the roof terrace which we thought particularly pleasant as you emerge into the sunshine on the terrace in the morning. Ordinarily we never ever eat in hotels prefering instead to try the local restaurants. However on this occasion we decided to try dinner at the riad on the first night as we'd been up since 4 and couldn't be bothered finding somewhere else. Suffice to say we ate there every evening thereafter. There's no menu you get what you're given (I think vegetarians are also catered for) but the food is excellent and plentiful. Most of the staff speak very little English but we had little difficulty communicating and nothing was too much trouble. And all this for a very reasonable price. Please be aware that the riad does not accept credit or debit cards only cheques or cash - this necessitated a few trips to ATMs to accumulate sufficient cash to pay at the end and they should really make this clear at the outset. Highly recommended.,Date of stay: October 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/horacethefrog

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,R0nnie206 wrote a review Nov 2010,50,Attractive and comfortable riad with extremely helpful staff makes one want to return to Marrakech,"We were picked up at the airport necessary to find this lovely riad located in some twisty turning streets in the Medina. When the door opened and we saw Les Trois Palmiers  (the three palm trees) and the lush and tiled surroundings we knew we choose the right place.  All our prior communication with owners and hosts Patrick and Christine was confirmed. They beautifully decorated this riad with comfort in mind and excellent taste.  Icham welcomed us with the first of numerous mint teas and was helpful with our many questions about where and how to explore Marrakech. He hand drew us a map to locate several sights and how to return to Les Trois Palmiers..  Our room was spacious clean with a huge tile tub/shower. It contained all that an upscale hotel would have but included the charm of a riad.  Dalila the cuisiniere (cook) was talented and friendly. Although we ate at several restaurants we mostly enjoyed dinner at ""home"" in our Riad.  All the staff went out of their way to be helpful. We are thankful to Mustapha and Badr for all their care and also giving us a better understanding of the lifestyle in Morocco.  Other staff members that were kind are Habida Dhiba and Khadija  We say this is a place to return to.....and so we did!

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,Mark A wrote a review Nov 2010,50,Beautiful oasis of a riad in a fantastic city,Walking down the dark alleyways (even though it was the middle of the day!) to the riad gave us our first taste of the fascinating city of Marrekech. Our nervousness about never finding the place again on our own was premature as you soon get a feel for the city and get your bearings thats all part of the fun! Walking into the riad for the first time was a lovely surprise the photos on their website do not do the place justice. Patrick the owner proudly gave us a tour of each room explaining in detail how the place was renovated. The riad has been beautifully restored with so much effort and cost going into adding special touches and the furniture etc all fits in perfectly to the overall effect. The staff could not have been more helpful and friendly throughout our stay always with a smile on their face nothing was too much trouble. Breakfast on the roof terrace was lovely wish we had eaten at riad one night based on other trip advisor comments that will have to be next time! Please ignore recent rather negative posting some people are never happy! Although my only criticism does coincide with one of their moans plastic lining on sheet on the bed in roof terrace bedroom (I think other beds in riad did not have this) are a bad idea and resulted in poor nights sleep every night.,Date of stay: October 2010,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Brighton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markaQ723BQ

Patrick (onwer) and the gentlemen in charge (Mustaf√°) really try to go out of their way. Watch outs: 1) Work is being done in nearby waste system and it creates a really bad odor (at least in my room; El Bach√°) particularly early morning and nights - when you happen to be there. 2) Is allowed to smoke everywhere in the Riad so be careful if you happen to be sensitive to tobacco.,Date of stay: October 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Caracas, Venezuela",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dividendo

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,Ann_and_Ray_10 wrote a review Oct 2010,20,A smokers' riad,Having stayed in a delightful riad in Fez we looked forward to the same in Marrakesh. Riad Les Trois Palmiers has been restored in a clean cream style and the owners seemed to leave most of the care of guests to the very helpful staff. The main reason why we would not recommend this riad however is the fact that guests are able to smoke wherever they want and other guests are not able to get away - consequently we did not dine there and even breakfast in the courtyard was spoilt. Our room did not have a fridge the bed was covered by a plastic undersheet which made it uncomfortableand there was no computer in the riad that we could use. To top it all we were told that they would not take credit cards one day before we had to leave which made it extremely difficult to take out enough cash to pay the bill (had we booked through the website apparently we would have known this fact in advance).,Date of stay: October 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Hamilton, New Zealand",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ann_and_Ray_10

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,Helentilly wrote a review Oct 2010,50,Loved our stay here!,We stayed in Marrakech for 4 nights at the Riad - would DEFINITELY recommend the airport transfer service as no way would we have found it without this!    The Riad is tucked away down a windy alley away from the hustle and bustle of the Medina great location for the main sights and not far from a nice bar / restaruant Cafe Arub.    The staff were beyond helpful - so attentive and friendly served a really lovely breakfast each day - we also chose to eat dinner here 2 nights of our 4 as the food was amazing (the best I'd say out of our 2 wks in Morocco) dinner up on the candlelit roof terrace was also a really lovely experience.    The only negative I would give for this Riad is our room was a little on the small side (it was up on the roof terrace can't remember the name) but was furnished and decorated to a very high standard it wasn't a problem at all - I'd go back here if we ever come back to Marrakech!,Date of stay: September 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,England,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Helentilly
Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,GN100 wrote a review Oct 2010,50,Marrakech Jewel,A group of us stayed four nights and found the owner Patrick and his staff both pleasant and helpful. The owners have restored the riad beautifully - it is in fact two riads joined together. This gives rise to two courtyards  two pools and two roof terraces to relax on so one can always find a quiet spot. As with most riads in the old part of town it would not be easy to find the first time so arrange an airport or other pick up. When you arrive Patrick will give you his hand drawn map which is very easy to use when finding your way to and from the main square. All the facilities work well including the bathrooms and there is plenty of hot water. Although the riad is located down some small pedestrian (or donkey cart) access only streets I never found any feeling of insecurity even late at night.,Date of stay: October 2010,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Casares, Spain",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GN100

The riad is perfect after a day in Marrakech which is very lively you return to a oasis of calm. The decor is great and attention to detail shows. Patrick and his staff are wonderful and nothing seems to much trouble. The breakfast are lovely and fresh and we dined in which is was also lovely and very authentic. Also dine at Cafe de Arabe which was good. Location is spot on not to far from souks and night market square.It is perfectly safe to walk around locals are friendly. I would just return and stay in riad next time there is a gorgeous terrace for sunbathing or chilling as long as Patrick doesn't change anything!

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,SSSteph wrote a review Oct 2010,40,"Good riad, with a few quirks","Stayed here for 4 nights and loved the decor as well as the very nice and thoughtful staff. If you book for more than 3 nights you get transfers to/from the airport which was a godsend. Note that it is very difficult to find and it takes a few days to get your bearings via the alley ways but the staff will do everything they can to make sure you find your way back. We booked the triple room which is on the ground floor next to the courtyard which was fine for us two ladies but if you are a couple and want privacy ask for a room where other guest won't be sitting just outside your window/door. The bathroom was a dream as well as the lovely bath products that were addicting. The food was good and the service amazing but we cannot compare it to much else since we rarely ate elsewhere. We especially liked the attentive service and gentle nature of Mr. Hicham and the other staff given that we were two women travelers who were made to feel very uncomfortable outside of the hotel by Moroccan men in general. We did book a great camel ride (actually a dromedary) by the owner of the Riad and it was the highlight of our trip. The owner also booked us a guide (Mr. Riz) to visit the market (zouk) which I would NOT recommend due to him only speaking French taking us to his friend's shops talking on his cell constantly and walking so fast he lost us twice in the market; not to mention being sexually harassed at a shoe store while he took tea with the shop owner outside. Although this is not a direct reflection on the Riad it should be noted that any tour you book via the hotel has to be paid at the hotel which puts the responsibility of the extracurricular services on the hotel. They also booked us a private driver & guide to Ouarzazate for the day and although we liked it we were not told of the extra charges that were not included in the higher price (25 euro more vs. tours advertised on the back of the hotel given map) until we were at the sites. So make sure to ask for exactly what is and is not included in all hotel booked excursions. Most important note is to make sure you have enough cash at the end of your stay to pay the bill since they do not take credit cards and their exchange rate is not very favorable as that of a bank. All in all the place is very nice and the service by all of its staff superb.    On a separate note re shopping before you purchase anything in the market I highly recommend first visiting the ""Ensemble Artisanal:"" ‚Äì a government backed handicraft center. Prices are fixed and without pushy salesmen persuading you to buy overpriced Moroccan goods of unknown origin. It is about one block up from the Koutoubia mosque on Avenue Mohammed V. After the hassles at the market we found we got better deals here plus quality items minus the headaches from 2hr bargaining sessions. Also you get to see the craftsmen at work and some stores benefit women cooperatives directly.",Date of stay: September 2010,Trip type: Traveled with friends,San Francisco,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SSSteph

It is well situated close to the Medina and a 5-10 minute walk to Jemaa el-Fna. Though it is initially difficult to find the staff of the riad will generally meet you when you first arrive to navigate you through the alleys. The riad is comfortable well maintained and the beautifully renovated. There are several rooms available and whilst the room that I had was small it was clean and very comfortable. The charm of this riad is the attentiveness and helpfulness of the staff. The staff were not overbearing and provided invaluable advice on places to visit eat and were a wealth of information.

Close to major tourist attractions in the heart of the Medina it is very well located. All the staff are extremely friendly and couldn't do enough to see that we were well looked after. Patrick the owner is a perfect host and keen to share details of his expriences as a Frenchman owning restoring and running a Riad in Marakech.    Our bedroom was large and comfortable and the double bathroom including 3 or 4 person bath was something special!    The alleyways leading from the main street down to the riad are scary at first but safe even at night but we were very glad we had booked a driver organised by the Riad to collect us from the airport as this meant we were met in the main street at the taxi drop-off point by the hotel staff and escorted the few hundred yards to the door. We woudn't have found it otherwise but once you know where it is and get your bearings it's easy enough.    Food taken either in the downstairs courtyard or the rooftop terrace was very good and some of the bast we experienced in the city including from those reastaurants (both higher and lower priced) recommended in our guide book. A varying set meal is served each evening with no menu and no options so a simple menu on the table decscribing tonight's meal would be helpful and informative!

Great location - just a few mins walk from the start of the souks 10 mins from main square. Some great restaurants just around the corner. It's nicely tucked away so peaceful and away from hussle and bussle.    Rooms very clean - faultless in this department. Great attention to detail by cleaning staff.    Staff very friendly abd helpful - everyone from Partick (the owner) and Isham the ladies in the kitchen the guy who looks like Nicolas Anelka and served our breakfast (sorry forgot his name!) - were very welcoming and could not do more to help make our stay more enjoyable. Thank you all!    The only grumble was regarding pick up from airport - they didn't turn up!  They claimed not to have received an email from us which confirmed our arrival time - even though they replied to it and we had it printed out! Anyway luckily we had their number so called them up and they arranged for taxi to pick us up from airport 40 mins later (after we had already waited 30 mins). So not the best start and first impression as you can imagine! So probably more 4.5 out of 5 rather than 5.    Be sure to take their tel number with you - otherwise no chance of finding them on your own if pick up does not turn up - as you will discover when you get to the old town! It's a maze!

Room was small but beautiful high ceiling comfy bed lovely decor very clean and biggest bath I have ever seen! Breakfast was served on the rooftop terrace nice food and great views. Only bad point was didn't have the best night sleep you could hear everything else going on in the hotel and were awoken by the call for prayer early on.

The staff are friendly helpful and professional; the decor is beautiful and very serene; the food...well the food is simply amazing and excellent value; and finally the location is perfect right on the edge of the souks (which I personally found a lot of fun!) and in easy walking distance either of the sites themselves or somewhere to find a taxi to get you to further out places.  Nothing was too much trouble for the staff and any help you require is given with no problem at all from advice on whether you've been stung in the souks to arranging trips to restaurant recommendations to a cold drink.  The rooms are beautiful. My friend and I stayed in the ground floor triple room and it was comfortable and exceptionally clean. The bathroom had everything you needed and the shower was lovely. Outside our room was the dining area where the pool was also found and this too was gorgeous although the water was FREEZING! (Not necessarily a bad thing after toasting yourself on a sun lounger on the roof it's just what you want!).  Overall I really can't recommend this place enough and if I hear of anyone wanting to visit Marrakech I'll certainly be pointing them in the direction of Les Trois Palmiers.

Our room with ensuite bathroom was clean comfortable and well designed. We ate dinner on the Riad rooftop one evening and both thoroughly enjoyed the Moroccan fare. Both of us would be happy to return in the future.,Date of stay: May 2010,Trip type: Traveled with friends,United Kingdom,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HoldOnTiger
Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,shoredistants wrote a review Jun 2010,50,Outstanding service. Unforgettable stay!,I picked this riad from a long list of many on the web. I had literally studied each and every hotel and riad in Marrakech since this stay is rather special. We were going to get married in Morocco. The location is unbeatable and it‚Äôs close to Djemaa el Fna. Well! I've been in some nice hotels in my time but this one is AMAZING! We enjoyed this riad hugely especially due to the large size of the suite compared to most places. Our room and bathroom (which was almost as big as the bedroom) were wonderful. The room was immaculate and comfortable. We had even got flower arrangement in our suite the day before the wedding. It was an experience that I will never forget!!!!!    Patric and Caroline was so charming and genuinely helpful. They helped us from hiring a shuttle the whole wedding day taking us to the embassy in Rabat for getting married to the bookings of the gorgeous restaurant ‚ÄúMaison du Gourmet‚Äù for our wedding reception in Casablanca to the bouquet for my wedding. It couldn‚Äôt been any better. They was also really blessed of having the most pleasant cheerful and polite staff. They was always helpful and had a smile on their lips as soon they saw us.    We had a really bad flight with Royal Air of Maroc from Milan and witch we also found out that they had another flight company called Atlas Blue that was hired instead (the same company Royal Air M.. are trying to get rid of bad reviews by trying to have Atlas Blue flying for them). Imaging to get the news from Milan that there have never been any flights between Milan and Marrakech when we were heading there for our wedding. But there was a flight to Casablanca. So we took it of course and actually it ended with RAM was flying anyways. Royal Air of Maroc and what they call their other company - Atlas Blue is pure scammers!! We had as bad experience with them on the flight back. This time was that they tried to cancel the flight since it was only 40 people booked. Anyways when we arrived finally in Casablanca our angel Patric had arranged a car to pick us up from the Airport in Casablanca to Riad Les Trois Palmiers in Marrakech. How sweet isn‚Äôt that!!!    From top to bottom everything in this riad is in perfect standards. The riad is gorgeous as other reviewers have said. We had our breakfast always on the roof with the delightful Moroccan mint tea. This is the one I would pick for a leisure travel. Internet was easy accessed by a code you get from the reception and it is for free. They arranged also car service for us to and from the airport which was impeccable and it was free too.    We where 5 people from the family and we stayed 7 nights. The stay was truly outstanding. I almost don't want to write this review in case everyone books it and we can't get in again ;))),Date of stay: May 2010,Trip type: Traveled with family,Malta,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shoredistants

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,avidaaron wrote a review May 2010,50,Great experience in Marrakech,This was our first visit to Marrakech and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. The Riad run by Patrick and Caroline was just wonderful. The room we had was spacious clean and very well presented. The bed was a little hard but we both slept very well after all the walking we did. The food at the Riad was very impressive and we regret dining there only one night. The staff we friendly and couldn't do enough to make our trip memorable and enjoyable. The Riad is located to the north and about 10mins walk from the square - we were very happy with the location. Patrick organised a private tour to the Atlas mountains which was a real highlight and worth every euro. Our guide and driver were magnificent company. Oh the Riad has wifi in the lobby area which was very handy for staying in touch with home.,Date of stay: May 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Sydney, Australia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/avidaaron

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,Darren-Alexa wrote a review May 2010,50,A piece of Paradise in the chaos of Marrakech,We have just returned after 6 days in Marrakech staying at Les Trois Palmiers. The attention to detail and quality of the restoration are excellent the staff are superb friendly and helpful...nothing seems to much trouble. Patrick and Carolyine are fantastic hosts and you can also use the Riad attached next door as part of your trip which they also own.    We had a large room/junior suite which was fantastic very clean and spacious.    The food at the Riad is amazing. They were more than happy to book excursions for us and give advice (such as stall 99 in the market for food which if you like fish is a must...). Breakfast on the roof terrace in a morning is a great way to start your day and a bottle of wine or a mint tea up there after your day sight seeing is a great way to relax :-)    Hard to believe that the chaos of Marrakech is just outside the Riad doors when you are inside this beautiful and relaxing bit of paradise. If we go back to Marrakech we will book Les Trois Palmiers again....,Date of stay: May 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Nottingham,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Darren-Alexa
Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,RetiredPornStar wrote a review Apr 2010,40,Amazing location to expore city.,Stayed here for five nights and have to say that the Riad is a stunning redevelopment with such a fine eye for detail that its a must stay even for one night. Patrick the owner speaks French German Arabic and English and is a real professional along with his wife. We stayed on the terrace which was small but cosy with stunning views from the roof top. Only critisism is that in the middle of the Iceland eruption and the scrabble to get home we were told they only accept cash as a payment.  Don't think it mentions that on there web page.

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,NicholasS_10 wrote a review Apr 2010,50,Excellent Riad,A really excellent Riad. very firendly and helpful staff (particularly Isham who was so helpful and attentive). Beautiful rooms very comfortable and exceptionally quite and peaceful. Food was delicious - the best that we had in Morocco and dining on the roof terrace under the starts was a real pleasure.  Its secluded location makes it difficult to find without help so use the hotel car service from the airport. We would thoroughly recommend it.,Date of stay: April 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Kings Lynn,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NicholasS_10
Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,Saj-Zen wrote a review Jul 2010,50,"Romantic, Relaxing and a Perfect Location to Explore Marrakech!",I chose Marrakech as our honeymoon destination. After a lot of research into the riads and hotels available I decided on Riad Les Trois Palmiers from all the positive comments.  Owned by Patrick and Caroline the moment we stepped into the Riad we felt at home. They were so welcoming nothing was too much trouble for them or their staff - especially Isham who was always around and very helpful. On our first evening we had a meal there and were not disappointed.  The room was beautiful clean spacious and relaxing. The adjoining bathroom was an added luxury. After a long day exploring the sights of Marrakech it was nice to come back to the relaxing atmosphere of the Riad.  The Riad is situated about a 10-15 minute walk from the main market square Jemaa el Fna  A special thanks to Patrick Caroline and Isham for making our stay that little bit special.,Date of stay: June 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Bradford,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Saj-Zen
Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,MissE_79 wrote a review Jul 2010,50,Fabulous Riad!,This Riad deservedly holds it's high ranking on TripAdvisor.  Everything we experienced was perfect. The staff are friendly helpful and professional; the decor is beautiful and very serene; the food...well the food is simply amazing and excellent value; and finally the location is perfect right on the edge of the souks (which I personally found a lot of fun!) and in easy walking distance either of the sites themselves or somewhere to find a taxi to get you to further out places.  Nothing was too much trouble for the staff and any help you require is given with no problem at all from advice on whether you've been stung in the souks to arranging trips to restaurant recommendations to a cold drink.  The rooms are beautiful. My friend and I stayed in the ground floor triple room and it was comfortable and exceptionally clean. The bathroom had everything you needed and the shower was lovely. Outside our room was the dining area where the pool was also found and this too was gorgeous although the water was FREEZING! (Not necessarily a bad thing after toasting yourself on a sun lounger on the roof it's just what you want!).  Overall I really can't recommend this place enough and if I hear of anyone wanting to visit Marrakech I'll certainly be pointing them in the direction of Les Trois Palmiers. Perfect!,Date of stay: June 2010,Trip type: Traveled with friends,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MissE_79

Riad Les Trois Palmiers El Bacha,DaD-trip1 wrote a review Feb 2009,50,"Great Riad, wonderfull experience","My daughter and I stayed five days at the end of January 2009 in the Riad Les Trois Palmiers / El Bacha (they are next to each other and connected). We are from Switzerland and this was our first time in Morocco. We found about the Riad on the Internet. Our experience was wonderful. The Riad is in the heart of the medina some 15 minutes walk through the souks from Djemma el Fna. It is also within the walking distance to Medersa Ali Ben Yousef (some 10-15 minutes; a must!) and pretty much everything else most people expect to see in Marrakech: Mosque Koutoubia Palace El-badi Saadien Tombs etc. We walked to all these places which is really the best way to ""feel"" Marrakech. the Majorelle and Menara Gardens and the new city are a short taxi drive away. The Riads are perfectly placed to explore the city. The neighborhood of the Riads is very quiet and safe yet you are just few steps from the shops and excitement of the souks.  Patrick (the owner? manager?) was very kind and helpful. Besides the breakfast we opted to have dinner each evening in the Riad and that was an excellent decision: the food was delicious atmosphere very relaxed the stuff very courteous and helpful the cooks the first class and yet everything was affordable. The rooms were excellent comfortable spacious spotlessly clean as was the whole Riad. Patrick organized for us a car for a day trip to Essaouira and the driving through Marrakech was another unforgettable experience.  The Riads have great roof tops with chairs tables and plants and are very nicely decorated You can see the whole city from there the Atlas (weather permitting) and it is a great place to spend an evening when tired from the sightseeing.  The transport from and to the airport was organized by Patrick so we did not have to worry about that.  I warmly recommend the Riads Les Trois Palmieres and El Bacha and if we again go to Marrakech (which we hope to do) we will certainly stay there again. I'll be happy to give more information about the Riads and Marrakech.",Date of stay: January 2009,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Geneva, Switzerland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaD-trip1
