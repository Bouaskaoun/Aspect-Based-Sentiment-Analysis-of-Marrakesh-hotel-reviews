"Radisson Blu Hotel, Marrakech Carre Eden",Jane M wrote a review Mar 17,40,Nice location,Big busy hotel. Really busy. Great location that is walking distance to many shops/attractions in the new part of Marrakesh. Adjacent to a shopping mall. There is a starbucks next door also a McDonald's. If you want to feel that you are in any big city then stay here. Not a Morrocan experience. Staff was friendly and helpful multilingual. Room was nice pool area is very nice and the pool itself was very nice. Food was good. Breakfast buffet was huge and very comprehensive for all types of food. A bit hectic at breakfast at peak times but the staff keeps food trays filled and tables cleared.,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Chicago, Illinois",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S8699CKjanem

"Radisson Blu Hotel, Marrakech Carre Eden",Amandasjallsaints wrote a review Jan 2023,30,The Pool Is Covered Over and Not in Use,We selected this hotel specifically for its heated pool. We arrived at the hotel to find the very small reception totally overcrowded with a large group. After check in we had an incredibly long walk to our OK room. We then found a message on the room TV saying that the pool had a leak and was out of use. We double checked and there was no information on the hotel web site or any other booking sites saying the pool was closed. The hotel does offer an alternative visit to another hotel with a pool but you have to give notice etc etc and it is at least a 10 minute taxi ride away. The breakfast is in the most dimly lit restaurant I have been in. It was virtually impossible to see the food. We had booked for several nights but checked out after 1. The reason for the three stars is that the reception staff were incredibly nice and apologetic about the pool otherwise the review would have had less stars,Date of stay: January 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Amandasjallsaints
"Radisson Blu Hotel, Marrakech Carre Eden",m_morgan02 wrote a review Jan 2023,40,Lovely short break,We were warmly welcomed from the moment we arrived. The reception staff are all fabulous very polite and friendly and very helpful. We had a slight issue with payment of our stay (we had prepaid as part of a package booking but for some reason it wasn't showing on the reservation. We had to wait jntil the next morning to get this confirmed but even then on check out we had the same issue and needed to wait to get it resolved). The staff were very helpful and polite throughout this.  The location is great for exploring Marrakech not far from the hotel and walking distance to many good attractions.  The room was perfect for our needs the bathroom being impressively huge! We were on the first floor and did find that in the evenings you could hear a lot of noise from the downstairs bar and outside area - great if you want to enjoy from a far on your balcony but not so good if you want a quiet night in or an early night.  Breakfast was plentiful and varied and we ordered food in rhe evening too which was really tasty!  All in all a great trip and thank you to Aissam and Sara on reception for all their help.,Date of stay: November 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Greater London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/m_morgan02

The rooms are spacious and beds very comfortable and the balcony a real plus. All staff greet with a smile and are always on hand to assist and help. The breakfast buffet is plentiful with lots of choice hot and cold. I used the spa for a massage and would recommend it if you are looking for a bit of pampering. An added bonus to the hotel is that is has a small shopping mall next to it.,Date of stay: January 2023,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ErkanB_12

"Radisson Blu Hotel, Marrakech Carre Eden",awharton wrote a review Dec 2022,10,Worst Hotel We Have Ever Been To,Not sure where to start. This is not anywhere close to a 5 star hotel. Maybe 2 stars at best. Avoid at all costs if you are looking for a luxury (or even clean) experience. We were due to stay six nights but could only tolerate three nights and checked out early.    Just a few areas to point out:    1. Very unhelpful at check in - rude and aggressive  2. Filthy dirty hotel overall - stains all over the carpets chairs dirt and dust - just very unhygienic  3. Bed is like sleeping on a rock  4. Kids club is dirty and everything is broken  5. Breakfast walking into a war zone    Stay anywhere but here in Marrakech.,Date of stay: December 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Daydream299888

"Radisson Blu Hotel, Marrakech Carre Eden",mjk43 wrote a review Oct 2022,20,"Location tick, other aspects not so good",First the good bits: the hotel is well-located on top of the Carre Eden mall. A number of small boutiques may not be all that useful but the laundry/dry cleaner and the supermarket certainly were for us. The supermarket makes good sushi to order and salads.  The other good bit is that the room has a fridge for storing drinks or other cold produce bought in the supermarket.    Sorry that‚Äôs the good bits finished. So now the bad bits.    Firstly the maintenance:    We paid for early check in from 11.00 and arrived at 11.30. The room was ready but we weren‚Äôt able to do anything until 14.00 but sit around in the room wondering whether to unpack or change rooms whilst a succession of maintenance people came to fix the aircon (which initially would not come on at all) and identify and fix the leak from our sink (they never managed and we were instead supplied with extra towels for the side of the sink and the floor below it). They did manage to get the lights by the bed working (loose connection) but they never managed to fix the shaving mirror which stayed resolutely pointing at the floor throughout our stay. To give the hotel some minor credit I only had to ask once whether they thought it would be appropriate to remove the early check-in charge from the bill which they presented to me at check out.    Secondly the design    There is no separate bathroom. There is a large shower cubicle with an opaque door and a toilet also with an opaque door but no lock. There is nowhere to do anything in privacy from your roommate. As a long-time couple we could manage with that but many other guests may not feel so comfortable. And that leaky sink is actually in the bedroom.    Thirdly the noise    The bar has live music until 23.00 daily. We were two floors higher up and not directly above it despite which our room ‚Äúshook‚Äù with the bass of the music for several hours. The volume is extraordinary and the bar keeps its doors to the pool open plus on one night the hotel also fired up the outside speakers. We‚Äôd paid for a pool view room ‚Äì and it was a much nicer view than street-facing would have been ‚Äì but this noise was the price.    Fourthly the gym    Aircon is kept off in the gym and a request to turn it on was met with a promise to get someone to do it but it never happened. The thermostat on the gym wall read 29 degrees. I managed 20 minutes on the cross-trainer. My wife gave up after 10 minutes finding it hard to breathe.    Fifth the air conditioning in the bedroom    Once maintenance got it working we found that it had two functions only: off; or artic gale. There is no fan speed adjustment available and it is set to high/fierce and the thermostat is located in the warmest part of the room well behind the aircon fan outlet. So even with the a/c thermostat set to 28 degrees the icy blast just continues    Sixth and final bad bit    It is a conference hotel. Of course many city centre hotels are conference hotels. But in this case there does not appear to be a dedicated conference area and the conference took place along our corridor of the fourth floor. The delegates and the conference hosts all seemed courteous but we did have to squeeze past them in the narrow corridors to get to and from our room; plus the corridors were made even narrower by the large amount of signage for the conference including one particularly big sign directly adjacent to our door. Certainly not a relaxing environment.    In summary then a really poor choice of hotel by us. Luckily this was the mid part of our stay in Marrakech as we started with three nights at a very pleasant Riad in the Medina then the three nights at the Radisson Blu in Gueliz and finally five nights at a very nice leisure hotel out of town. So at least the rotten Radisson was sandwiched by two much better choices.,Date of stay: October 2022,,"Greater London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mjk43
"Radisson Blu Hotel, Marrakech Carre Eden",littlemissbecky wrote a review Oct 2022,50,Welcoming and helpful,I arrived late after a delayed flight from Gatwick to the hotel which has an interesting layout. After being made welcome and shown where reception was (2nd floor) I was met by lovely and friendly reception staff who were very helpful. I was then shown my room which was basically outstanding. Clean spacious and with an extremely comfy bed it felt like home. I felt very refreshed after my first nights sleep and when I had a couple of questions the staff again couldn't do enough to help me. I'm here for a conference which starts tomorrow and not only am I looking forward to that but also the rest of my stay.,Date of stay: October 2022,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Swindon, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/littlemissbecky

The rooms were perfect and clean location is perfect right next to the care Eden shopping mall. I have to point out the staff this is what realy makes the hotel worth staying at. From day 1 the staff were amazing and helpful. The customer service provided was above and beyond expectation. From check in to check out everything was perfect. A special mention for staff wassima and basra who made sure our stay was perfect. The customer service provided by these 2 was above and beyond.

"Radisson Blu Hotel, Marrakech Carre Eden",Andrei Plat wrote a review Aug 2022,10,The Radisson Blu Marrakech is an embarrassment to the entire Radisson group.,The hotel has a good bar and restaurant there is a swimming pool a nice big balcony and a view of everything..... There are far more minuses than pluses...  Didn't like it !!!  1.When you check in they take a security deposit (no mention of it in the booking conditions) but most importantly the return of the deposit I've been waiting for more than two weeks (an employee assured that the three days maximum) and then got the refund after a long correspondence and swearing...  2. In the suite just the sockets didn't work there was no electricity the bathroom locks didn't work.  What is strangest with the lights off the outlets in one of the rooms did not work there was no electricity.  3. And the best part !!!!  When I was about to leave (I paid for the hotel parking in advance) I was blocked by parking attendants - beggars and started to demand (just demand not ask) scaring my children to pay them 50 MAD of course they were sent to hell a hotel employee came out and talked to them about something...(maybe they work together). Finally when I started to call the police the same hotel employee said something to these valets and they left. .....

Upon arrival we were told we needed to pay a deposit of ¬£250 which would not be charged to my credit card unless needed. This is not advertised anywhere so came as a bit of a shock to us.    The deposit was paid and on checkout we were assured no charges will be made on the credit card for the deposit. After arriving back in the UK I could see a charge of ¬£251 had been made to my card and not refunded even though it has been 4 weeks now.    I have tried to call the hotel but to no avail. I have also sent 3 emails which have been ignored.    I would suggest if you are staying here then do not pay the deposit as I have seen from other reviews that some guests have refused to pay this.

"Radisson Blu Hotel, Marrakech Carre Eden",Nalinder wrote a review Jun 2022,30,Disappointing start to our stay.,Overall this hotel is in a great location rooms are clean and the vast majority of the staff our super friendly. We didn't however have the best start to our holiday and I did raise a complaint with the duty manager during our stay.    I therefore make some honest recommendations to hopefully improve service:    - Firstly we paid for a pool view however our room was located at the back of the hotel so not anywhere reasonably located near the pool. This room should therefore be advertised under a different package.  - Additionally our rooms were located a few doors down from an area of the hotel having major construction. Whilst this wasn't a disruption to our sleep in the evening it was very loud during the day.  - The management of the pool area was the biggest bug bear for us during our stay. There is a sign which clearly states if your stuff is left for longer than an hour it will be moved. However when i raised this issue with the pool man he said the guests were out for lunch despite a family of 5 returning over 6 hours later. It felt like French speakers were being given special privileges to the British and it was hugely frustrating to experience. We also wasn't once offered a drink once whilst around the pool and had to wait for over 30 minutes when we did eventually go and ask directly at the bar. To the credit of Hamid (Duty Manager) he was extremely apologetic and the service did improve considerably on the remainder of our trip however I do not agree that there should be one pool man to cater for all guests (especially in 40 degree heat!)  - There is also a major issue with sun beds at the hotel as only a proportion come with a pillow etc compared to the lower end equivalent. Naturally guests all want to lay on the better option so it soon becomes a race to grab a sunbed. A simple solution is to ensure all sun beds match the same quality to avoid the disappointment of your guests.  - Personally it made me feel uncomfortable watching staff melt in face masks when working outside. I understand why this is done but possibly the rule should be reconsidered for staff working outside.  - Pillows! Really not to my taste look puffy but flat as a pancake when you lay your head.  - During our stay I had tried to book an extra nights stay as our flights had been changed last minute. The first time i tried the person on the front desk said no rooms were available despite BA and booking.com showing multiple rooms. A couple of hours later i spoke to another member of staff who booked us a room immediately which was surprising considering we were told to come back in a couple of days to book another night from the original front of house member. On the day of check out i was then informed the extra day wasn't processed correctly! It seems like not everyone on the front desk team is fully aligned and surely it shouldn't take 3 attempts to book an extra night. It would also be nice if the staff could advise guests of their full services during check in as this wasn't mentioned on our arrival.    With all that being said we would however stay here again mainly for its excellent location. All the best restaurants are on your doorstep and rooms are clean. I would just hope some of the issues raised could be addressed for a future stay.,Date of stay: June 2022,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nalinder

The staff were very friendly and attentive the doorman so kind to our 3 year old son always ready for a hug and a chat! We were upgraded to a suite upon arrival which was beautiful and overlooked the red city breakfast was a busy affair but we enjoyed sitting outside and taking our time over some delicious Moroccan tea and enjoying an array of wonderful foods both traditional and western. The pool is small but heated and always busy but if you are up early enough its easy to secure great sun loungers by the side of the pool. For children there was a play area located at the back of the hotel in the conference part but it was just a conference room filled with messy toys - no staff and quite a soulless part of the hotel. It was a shame there wasn't a kids club. Food was really nice and well cooked it was also affordable. Service on the evening was slow the bar and restaurant busier than the number of staff.

My problem is:  1) We made an online reservation on this hotel for a small family vacation for me my wife and son (2 adults + 1 child) for 12th Feb - 16th Feb 2020. Being a loyal Radisson member we would pay MAD 3960 + 40.000 radisson points for the full stay.  2) When we checked in we where told our son could not apply for a child as the limit was 12 year and are considered as adult. We where told that we had to upgrade our room for an additional MAD 1300 for the full stay due to my son being 15. We accepted.  3)Upon checkout they issued an inovice for over MAD 10.000. I declined and showed our original reservation and the 1300 upgrade fee. After a lot of time and the clerk talked to the manager he appoligised and issued an invoice totaling MAD 5.543 including taxes. The checkout process took a lot of time and I had a taxi waiting. And the total was in the ballpark of my expectations (3960+1300) so I paid and left.  4) MAD 5543 was charged to my credit card and paid.  5) On the 11th March (almost 1 month after checkout) I have beed additionally charged for MAD 3960.  6) I send a email to the hotel on the 12th March and again 16th March - No respond they ignor my mails  7) On the 16th March I called the hotel and is asked to resend my mail.  8) Responce from hotel is ""I have purchased 2 parties one with payment of cash/points and one with Cash."" - And this is NOT correct we where only 3 people that shared a room and we only had one reservation and only one room !  9) I have send 2 mails on this respond and also requested them to call me - and suprise no answer.    I have taken contact to my credit card provider to object for this amount - but lets see if I get my money back. For now this is money out of my pocket because of their error.    I just want to warn others against this hotel - as this is no way to treat or cheat their customers by unauthoized withdrawing unaccounted amounts from their credit cards and also I loose trust in Radissons loyalty program.",Date of stay: February 2020,,"Vaerloese, Denmark",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/159briann

During the last week in February (2020) my mum and I visited Marrakech for the first time for four nights and chose the Radisson Blu Carre Eden hotel. We were not disappointed.    Staff  We received a warm welcome on arrival and all the staff we encountered from the security guards reception cleaners and restaurant staff - throughout our stay were professional and initiated great customer service and care. They were very hospitable to all guests including guests who were people of colour. Some memorable people included the cashier guy who signs you in at breakfast called Mohamed and one of the waiters called Abd-Ellatif who was very helpful and served us Moroccan tea during breakfast. The staff are a credit to the hotel. The restaurant staff at dinner including the evening general manager were also very professional and welcoming to guests.    Rooms  Our room were cleaned very well daily the mini bar was checked on a daily basis and there is a kettle for making tea/coffee in the room. The safe in the room kept playing up so we had to call for help on two occasions staff sorted it out quickly and efficiently. Some people had bath robes and slippers - our room didn‚Äôt. Breakfast and dinner options were pleasing. (We were half board).    Location  The hotel is located at a very good location. Right next door to the Carre Eden shopping centre including shops like H&M Carrefour and Zara is also outside. There is a city tour bus stop conveniently located outside the hotel to take you to all the major attractions and the hotel is around 20 minutes from the airport.

At first after having checked in they managed to misplace 2 of our luggage and had to wait for 90 minutes (our total stay was for 20 hours) to be discovered and delivered. One of the rooms that was given to me was smelling cigar's smoke and had to move to another room (after my request was given a room with pool view) as the Superior with balcony have an awful view. The condition of the room concerning maintenance was disappointing (have a look in the photos attached) in the toilet area there were @suspicious@ stains on the wall the bathrobe's belt was torn.  This is not what you expecting from an expensive 5* hotels and definitely not a Radisson one.,Date of stay: February 2020,,"Elounda, Greece",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/papv2000
"Radisson Blu Hotel, Marrakech Carre Eden",MrTabc wrote a review Feb 2020,50,Great stay,Lovely hotel very friendly staff who go above and beyond expectations to try to help you. Rooms were good quality as was service and friendliness of staff. Room service dont always have perfect english but it is manageable and I didnt find this a problem since english isnt their primary language. Facilities and service was all 5*. Only things i would want to improve is if there was more connectivity with the screen in the bedroom e.g. smart share so I could stream from my phone or laptop and they couldn't provide me with a hdmi cable one night (it was pretty late though). I would stay here again when I return to Marrakech as it was good value as well as great location walking distance to everywhere we didnt use a cab for our entire trip literally walked round the whole city. We were a bit last minute with our airport transfer and the hotel organised a hotel transfer for 300 dirhams in a moderate-premium car (e class) with well mannered driver. They were very helpful with printing our boarding passes too nothing could be too much trouble.

A modern hotel with the usual modern amenities provided with smiles . That‚Äôs the thing I saw smiles all round .

"Radisson Blu Hotel, Marrakech Carre Eden",Charlotte H wrote a review Feb 2020,50,Lovely hotel and perfect location,My husband and I are currently here until tomorrow morning. It has been a lovely short break with plenty of sun!  Very nice hotel clean lots of security on the door the pool was warm but it is in the shade quite early which was a little bit disappointing but we just moved to some chairs where the sun was towels provided but limited beds sometimes.  Food- breakfast has lots of options and is always re stocked. I also had a chicken salad for lunch which was ok not amazing but the chips are lovely! Homemade and perfect.  Room- comfortable bed we like to sleep with a fan but unfortunately they don‚Äôt have any clean room and cleaned everyday  Location- good location close to lots of shops and restaurants. The square is 40 dirham in a taxi away and I highly recommend going there! Belly dancing restaurants and all sorts like casinos!  Tips- always bargain people down they will try and charge you over the top prices for everything you purchase including taxis and cigarettes. I was told they were strict with clothes but I found as long as everything is not hanging out I.e cleavage and very short shorts for women then you will be ok. Be wise and precautious when walking out and about of the hotel.  Price- everything is reasonable with regards to price.  There are some building works going on but it doesn‚Äôt really bother me!  I think it would be beneficial to have some music by the pool.  But I‚Äôve had a lovely time.

"Radisson Blu Hotel, Marrakech Carre Eden",frequenttraveller674 wrote a review Feb 2020,40,Weird Room Layout,I liked this hotel in terms of comfort decor guest experience however I was very perplexed in the way the bathroom was designed. The sink is visible from the room. WC was private and shower private but there is no actual door into a bathroom. It's all open plan from the room and only WC and Shower have a door. So once I've had my shower I had to get myself dried and ready in full view of my Husband. Who was sat on the desk chair watching tv. Yes we have been married for 15 years but I still like some privacy to get ready washed brushing my teeth etc and world have liked for him to have that privacy too! If you dont get dried and ready outside the shower visible to whoever you share a room with you would need to either get ready in the WC (it too small and no hooks to even hang your clean clothes) or back in the wet shower cubicle!! Madness! Why did you make the screen that you can pull past the sink see through? The screen that would give a little privacy doesn't because you can see right through it!    The lifts were also a daft idea that I could only get to the 2nd floor then had to change lift to go either up or down. Just make the 4 lifts go both up and down!    Everything else In the hotel was great it was quiet it was comfortable I enjoyed the breakfast and service but would not return due to the open plan bathroom. I wasn't ideal and made me feel awkward. I imagine most people like me would prefer a bathroom experience with some privacy!,Date of stay: January 2020,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/frequenttraveller674

Winter is the perfect time to visit Morocco as the temps and weather are perfect. We found the hotel to be well located and only a short walk or cab ride to all major attractions. The hotel staff was extremely helpful in arranging currency exchange booking local tours and restaurants. The free breakfast buffet is amazing with a huge offering of well-prepared foods. The hotel‚Äôs fitness center is open 24/7 and is well-equipped (if only one didn‚Äôt have to access entry to it through the smoky bar and lounge).

Bang in the town centre with all the designer boutiques malls and cafes- our room overlooked the street; was great seeing the movements of people. There are loads of designer copies - handbags wallets- suitcases and many more. Everyone speaks French even the taxi driver very handy for those who are French speaking. The staff at the hotel were simply fantastic- one in particular- Abelatif- do look out for him- nothing is too much trouble- he certainly knows how to make you feel special- he served the Moroccan tea with a fine art. The morning buffet is very diverse with a mixture of the local food and pastries. Other Requests can also be made from the kitchen. We ate mostly out and throughly enjoyed the French cuisine as well as the Arabian food. Despite being over 35degrees then it was quite cool at the back in the shade. Good place to relax- the swimming was transparent which was something new for us. There is spa and Hammam treatment is something else. Small items were on sale in the entrance and at the reception which was on the next floor. One lift is used to go down from the reception only and others are to have access to rooms- takes some getting use to. Staff are good to give us tips of the cost of taxis beforehand so that we don‚Äôt pay tourist fare. From the airport it cost us 150 dirhams. Tips are your discretion. Busy roads and lots of people about. We visited some beautiful places - jardin marjorelle - a must see while in Marrakech.

Kids liked the pool. Massage at the spa was not great. The fitness center was nice. The restaurant surprisingly does not have vegetarian or vegan choices. The common areas appear a little tacky and could have been decorated more tastefully especially considering that pricing was similar to the Sofitel and other higher end hotels - the rooms were over USD 300. Smoking is allowed indoors in the bar area (and outside of course).

Only snags: 1. our quick turn around laundry was delivered to the wrong room (one floor below) but the gentleman who delivered it CAME BACK to the hotel and found it for us. 2.

"Radisson Blu Hotel, Marrakech Carre Eden",Frank M wrote a review Jan 2020,40,Pleased we chose this hotel,Some aspects of the service were a bit hit and miss but sometimes was exceptional. It's only 7 km from the airport (ca. 20 minutes by car). A taxi should cost about 70 dirhams (7 Euro) but not more than 10 Euro. Immediately upon arrival we were conned into paying 20 Euro. Our introduction to the most popular local habit of ripping off tourists. One of the main advantages of this hotel is that it is on a main road. There is almost always a normal taxi waiting out front so no need to plan ahead. Many are less accessible that really expose you to inconvenience at best and personal risk at worst. Linked to the main square & the Yves St Laurent Museum each within- 30 minutes walk. Currency is exchanged without commission at normal bank rates & without the additional transaction charge levied by machines. The hotel is comfortable. We slept well & were pleased with all room facilities - safe iron power sockets tea/coffee/hot chocolate & toiletries. The bedding was changed every second day and the cleaning was generally thorough. The lifts can be annoyingly slow. Reception is on floor 2 (third level - US). One lift only goes to reception & some lifts do not go to the ground floor. The breakfast has a wide enough offer for all tastes and is supported by an army of waiters. The bar menu has oysters for 12 Euro per dozen. Christmas dinner was 35 Euro -OK for 3 courses plus champagne. The outside pool is a decent size and the water warm. The gym is also well equipped although the TV and internet on the running machines were not operational. The wi-fi worked but not that well but there is a general lack of bandwidth everywhere we visited in Marrakech. Responses are often slow - both in the dining room bar and when phoning reception. During our second week we started to get pleasant surprises - cookies & sweets in the evening & bathrobes and slippers appeared. So is this normal or had it been overlooked previously? The hotel boasts a large footprint but this consists of rooms that surround a central pool. Menu prices were very reasonable. However trips and transportation if arranged by the hotel are expensive. there are better deals to be got. Plenty of tours will pick you up from the hotel - we visited the Atlas mountains including 30 mins camel ride for ca. 30 Euro. The hotel is not cheap but this is the price of decent accommodation and for those who appreciate certain standards it is well worth it. Bear in mind there will be a small surprise at bill time since local taxes (80 Euro for12 nights) are added on at that point -despite having paid in advance. This is normal nowadays but it really should be transparent at the time of booking.,Date of stay: December 2019,,"Reinach, Switzerland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FrankMoffatt

The airconditioning works at its minimum the rooms are not properly maintained (missing sink nozzle) extremely shabby lobby area swimming pool gives a glass bathtub look etc. it is not exactly close to the main happening centre of Marrakech. there are a couple of better options available.  breakfast served was very really good as it contained a lot of local food however the coffee served is an instant coffee. generally good but not outstanding as few other five-stars hotel in Marrakech,Date of stay: September 2019,,"Zurich, Switzerland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/185qamarm

The breakfast buffet is varied and what you would expect from this kind of hotel class.  Sadly the service was very disappointing. Staff are extremely friendly and courteous but not at all attentive. We would often have to ask specifically for obvious things like fresh cutlery for our meals or for them to clean up the legacies from other guests.  In the evenings we would have to ask several times to order drinks on the patio and waiting times were long.  It's not that they are understaffed but the employees just don't seem to be trained that well.  For a five star establishment and these rates I would have expected more.,Date of stay: October 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Zurich, Switzerland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pzhbfhr

To be honest Upon arrival to hotel everything was so smooth staff in this hotel were very helpful we had a very nice room 4072 the breakfast was good as well.  We had a first trip to atlas mountains the trip was so amazing starting from our driver was a very nice gentlemen helpful and very friendly with us all the trip thanks to this wonderful experience we decided to book another trip so we had a city tour that was booked by hotel guest relations but unfortunately the tour was not as we expected first a very old van was there to pick us up and the guide had a very bad English just like as his first experience we supposed to see many monuments as we were told the bahia palace the sedians tombs koutoubia mosque and square the only thing that we had was 40 minutes in bahia palace and a quick stop in Koutoubia mosque and rest was in the medina and souks I think the guide was concentrated on the souks more than historical visit.  When you pay 150 euros for a city visit you supposed to have a very good experience but with regrets we had nothing when we came back to hotel to complain this to guest relations the guy told us I will check this matter and till now nothing.,Date of stay: October 2019,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DEVAN644

From the great perfect room bed all the amenities nice pool great terrace and garden to relax before or after discovering Marrakesh. The FOOD was so delicious well prepared and displayed for breakfast. I kept talking about this experience with many of my friends since we came back. Also I had a moment that I left my precious hat at the pool and I realized the day after and I asked for help and Mr Rida Laachari Food and Beverages Manager was extremely professional and pleasant. He founded my hat after looking at their security camera and did the delivery to my room. When we came from our excursion he was smiling and explaining about his investigation to find my hat. Every day he kept asking us if we need more assistance or request and I even pushed my luck to ask him about their famous little cookies next to the Check In services‚Ä¶! Not only he shared the recipe of them he also introduced me to the chef pastry they delivered me a small well wrap box of these precious treats.

"Radisson Blu Hotel, Marrakech Carre Eden",christiangunadi wrote a review Oct 2019,30,"High expectations, deeply disappointed",I booked the hotel through Agoda because on the websites of the hotel the price was much higher.  One day prior to arrival i sent an email with my RR gold membership number.  I got a confirmation.  At check in the staff wasn't able to see my status and wasn't interested in searching. He said we can check at check out.  I got my room.  3075.  Nice but small room. Bathroom included in the rooms.  Shower smell like toilet at arrival.  No welcoming gift for gold members.    Later i went again to front desk and asked for late check out and benefits at the hotel for gold members.  The same staff from check in was very surprised that i am a gold member and my membership number was not added to my booking at that times.  He added it and told me about the benefits 15% discount on food and beverages.  Late check out was not available because of the reservation for the next day.    There is no turn down service at the room.  Till departure i missed my gift as a gold member.    The discount was not given because we drink alcohol and eat dessert. That's no food and beverages.    Breakfast looks nice but its a horrible choice.  More salad and fruits sweets and stuff.  No plates for coffee cups coffee in self service.    The entrance to car park is not clearly marked later the parking for hotel guests is also not clear.  Staff at basement is very friendly.    The situation for using lifts is horrible  some go just between ground floor and lobby one only for parking.  Long time to wait to get a lift.    Staff at lila is not very attentive.  Wait that you call them. The job of waiters are to take my money in a nice way not wait that i asked them to spent money.    In all the years i stayed in 5 stars hotel this hotel just get 3 of 5 stars from me.  A huge disappointment.    And for me no recommendations if you want to stay in Marrakesch.

Outside the hotel it's frenetic but inside it's quiet and calm a real haven away from the madness of the Medina. It's not historic or decorated like a palace but on the other hand it has all the facilities including a nice pool area which is unusual for a city hotel. Staff were really nice and helpful too.

"Radisson Blu Hotel, Marrakech Carre Eden",Gail Goldman wrote a review Oct 2019,20,Dangerous,A hotel can have a beautiful room in a great location but if there is danger in the room stay away. The geniuses who constructed the shower in the bathroom with open areas from the shower stall to the marble bathroom floor should have been fired. There are no bathtubs here as we requested so we were stuck with a large showering stall and a hand shower or a rainforest head. Either way if the water comes out of the open area to the bathroom floor you have a very dangerous situation. We were not the only ones who had this happen in our group and all were very alarmed. People almost on the slippery floors. One day the housekeeping staff did not even leave a bathroom mat and our floor was bare.  The other problem was that there was no climate control in our room. When we turned off the freezing AC it just kept going. One night we got it off and then the room was suffocating. Yes we called for help a couple of times and they could not adjust the temperature either. What a mess.

First off city hop on/off bus stop is right outside in front of the Starbucks next door. Hotel is also sandwiched between two entrances to Carre Eden which has a supermarket in the basement where you can stock up on the bottles of water you‚Äôll need for a day of sightseeing.    While the hotel staff is very friendly and welcoming hotel furnishings seemed a bit worn and there were some unpainted spots throughout my room and the hotel. My room was on the 3rd floor and there seemed to be incessant banging noises in the early afternoons. Breakfast was included (although it was not mentioned during my check in and I had to confirm that it was part of my stay) and it was a decent breakfast with plenty of options. I suggest scoping out a table outside for fresh cool air as it‚Äôs also right next to the pool.

The location of the hotel is very perfect and the rooms are very comfortable and spacious with fast internet good aircon. It has a shopping mall just below it so you don‚Äôt have to worry if you have forgot to pack any stuff. The staff of the hotel is very nice and helpful. They‚Äôre very friendly and very helpful especially Kam√®lia the Guest Relation Manager she really takes her job seriously and helps the guests in her best possible way. Being a vegan it is very difficult find a restaurant in Morocco that understands vegan concept but she managed to find me a restaurant near the hotel. Also did she helped me book my train tickets to Casablanca and guided me through the process. The hotel has a 24 x 7 money exchange at the reception which gives you a very fair rate for USD to MAD. I think the hotel should have more options for vegetarian in their food menu and for the breakfast of course.  I had booked the room pool side which has the view to this very nice courtyard with a see through pool where you can enjoy your breakfast or some drinks. The atmosphere is so special that it really felt like home to me.

"Radisson Blu Hotel, Marrakech Carre Eden",anakiyingi wrote a review Oct 2019,40,"Lovely stay, wouldn't call it 5*",In depth breakdown of my review as follows:    (You can type: Angela Nakiyingi Marrakesh travel vlogs on YouTube to see snippets of hotel)    LOCATION: Perfect! So many shops and restaurants around. 30 minute walk /10 minute drive to Medina. Little mall 2 minutes away with supermarket downstairs that closes late. Many currency exchange places available which was handy.    PRICE: Very affordable we booked on on the beach website. ¬£250 each for 4 nights & bed and breakfast- cheaper than booking direct.    STAFF: Very friendly and attentive. A bit slow when we went down for a spontaneous dinner. We got upgraded to a pool view balcony room but had to wait 2 hours to check in.    We were also asked to pay a ¬£400 pound deposit which we had not been made aware of prior. Unfortunately we decided not to pay and reassured we wouldn't use the bar tab or fridge contents in our room. Overall nice staff.    CLEANLINESS: I'm very particular when it comes to cleanliness. The hotel room was cleaned every day we were there. I have no issues at all about it.    DINNER FOOD: The dinner from the menu was absolutely tasty! It was presented very nicely with nice flavours. We had a burger and a Wrap. I really wanted to try the Tagine but it was 220 Dirhams which is approximately ¬£20- too expensive! I can tell that the Tagine would taste out of this world.    BREAKFAST FOOD: Mediocre at least. Nothing in the breakfast buffet was nice to my tastebuds. There is the option of fresh Omlette. The lady didn't cook it well so it was a bit runny. Drinks weren't special either. We only had breakfast once out of the 4 nights and decided to eat elsewhere-waste of money    OVERALL THOUGHTS: It's labelled 5* but I didn't really see a 'wow factor'. It was comfortable and a nice stay overall. If I am to return to Marrakech I'll probably stay in a better 5* hotel. Lovely staff pool and dinner.

The hotel itself was nice however the rooms could do with a deep-clean. I think the 4/5* that Europeans expect for the price they pay isn't exactly on par with what is offered in all countries. Having said that there were some wonderful staff members who went above and beyond to make our stay comfortable. This included Rashid who helped us to settle in and was always very friendly with our family. He really did fulfil the service that should be expected when paying 5* prices.  I do feel though that the breakfast needs updating. It was a tad too ethnic/local for us who have a slightly different palette for breakfast.

For 3 nights they had parties and discos till 1am which was not ideal when overlooking the area. The balconies were nice however still a lot of noise from the loud music and singing.  I did feel they were prioritising one group of guests over the majority other. There was no prior warning or notice.  Breakfast was very standard and repetitive every day with no variety at all.

"Radisson Blu Hotel, Marrakech Carre Eden",Flying_Kangaroo1 wrote a review Aug 2019,30,Not as good as reviews would suggest,"PROS: Super friendly and genuinely caring staff.  Hotel in excellent condition and located.  Rooms lovely and spacious. Breakfast juices and health drinks great. Good TV channel choices.Great clean irons an ironing boards.Great location. easy walking distance to old city straight down the road 15 mins. Great cafes restaurants and shopping in area. Modern hotel in excellent condition. Bedding OK    CONS: No face flannels only one bar of soap - where do I put it hand basin or shower??  AC unit in room only has temp control which isn't very sensitive. No fan control....it's cold colder or freezing. Minibar poorly stocked powerpoint are not standard european..you need adaptor from hotel. Not sure I'm a fan of open plan bathroom. Hotel full of holidaying and families....think noise and kid.s picking breakfast items up with bare hands and placing back. Have seen that each morning. Also it's not very relaxing for adults. Phone goes unanswered on each of the pre programmed 4/5 numbers.....very annoying I even called the emergency number and NO ANSWER...imagine I had needed medical assistance!.  Mini bar not restocked for 2 days. Toiletries rearranged without permission by housekeeping when clearly they have been set up by guest their way. Coffee and tea stocks not replaced for 2 days. Security is super tight you feel like you are in jail. It's way over the top. Someone at street level is all you need not someones at level 2 as well starring at you with a serious face all the time. It's a hotel not a bank we are here to enjoy our holiday not be given impression its so dangerous security is needed everywhere! Security cameras also everywhere. I really hated the over the top security here. Breakfast so so. No fresh berries no smoked salmon. Omelette station is a weird set up just on a table near a wall. Chefs are serious faced and never smile. Some breakfast tables not fully set up so you need to ask for sugar milk napkins. Food items and coffee removed when not finished! No slippers or robe in room. Pillows are terrible you'll need to place two under your hard for any support. Ordered room service burger medium to well - it came up half raw and uncooked! Fries were also stone cold (see pic). As with rest of middle east staff are amazingly helpful extraordinarily friendly and very eager to please. They just don't follow through and when guests aren't around their attention to detail and professionalism go out the window. I was disappointed the hotel tour manager refused to book shared tours for me. He insisted they only organised private tours at 3 x the price. I ended up booking what I had to on Viatour via internet. I was travelling alone so doing a private tour alone would have been boring. I've never encountered any hotel insisting they can only book private tours.    I wish trip advisor would sample hotels individually as I'm starting to find ""certificates of excellence"" mean very little based on personal experience thus taking away from the credibility of trip advisor and setting expectations for potential guests too high. I probably wouldn't stay here again.",Date of stay: August 2019,,Sydney,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Flying_Kangaroo1

The area is busy and surrounded by restaurants. There is also a shopping centre behind the hotel with a supermarket in it.  The rooms are quite nice they are relatively new comfortable and spacious. Bed is very comfy as well.  We used the pool and ate at the hotel restaurant. The pool is a really nice feature considering Marrakech's summer temperatures and the food in the restaurant is fair as well.

The staff are so nice by the end of the trip they all knew my sons name. Rooms are clean and big. The buffet breakfast has a wide variety and mint tea was perfect! My only negative was the room i was it didn't have a separate bathroom and the sink was in the room. I'd advise if you have a child to make sure that it is separate only because he kept banging his head on the side of the sink and after a shower there was water on the floor. It isn't a major issue but just for the convenience would get a different room. The location really is good. There is valet parking too! Your close to everything!

"Radisson Blu Hotel, Marrakech Carre Eden",MBSNJ wrote a review Jul 2019,20,Terrible hotel,"This hotel was by far the most expensive on our trip to Morocco and the worst actually the only one we didn't like. When we checked in they neglected to bring up our luggage until we asked about it and even then my husband had to ask several times and go down to the lobby to get them to do it. The hotel room seemed to be designed only for what they must have thought was an attractive ""modern"" non-Moroccan appearance because the functionality was terrible. Every time we took a shower it flooded the bathroom floor. The light by the bed could only be turned off by a switch that was on a wall too far to reach while in bed. Things like that. The included breakfast was fine and the pool looked nice. We stayed there because it was close to someplace we had to be that evening but at the price we paid I had expected it to be a really nice place to stay.",Date of stay: June 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,New Jersey,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MBSNJ

However I was very disappointment with the safety of my belonging and the reaction to incident reporting.    Whenever I arrive to a hotel I pack my stuff and place it in a way that I know which goes where.    In the second day of my stay I placed my airpods in the desk assuming such hotel will take care of people belonging. surprisingly when I came back I did not find it.  I searched allover the room assuming that the house keeping misplaced it while they were cleaning. but unfortunately that was not the case.    I spoke with the reception requesting their investigation they informed the security department. They took my number upon check out but unfortunately nothing happen. Even no update about the incident not via email or phone.    While I was reporting the incident I also heard from other traveller that she also lost something from her belongings.    It is horrible to say that I was expecting more decent treatment or follow up in incident reporting. Note that I won't report it if im not so sure about it.    So Be Aware and keep all of your valuable/important belonging in the safe.

This time i visited with my wife plus kids ( aged 8 & 11 ) for my mates wedding which was all night event on friday night.  Aftert the wedding we invited the married couple for sunday lunch ( i had seen photos and it looked good ).  Before my mate arrived i briefed the waiter .....re: newlyweds and showed him photos of the couple etc and gave him a good tip to bring a small cake out at the end....  We ordered food ( 3 mix grills plus lamb chops main plus a few mocktailsjuice etc  the cost of this was over 100euros.  the food was ok and similar in price to restaurants in manchester. drinks were average at 8euros for mocktail  After the food the waiter came with the cake with 4 other staff members and started singing happy birthday !!!!! how embarassing!!!. the newly weds thought it was our birthday and started singing along....we then told the waiter again that the celebration was a wedding not a birthday but it fell on deaf ears.....we didnt let this spoil things and laughed about it amongst ourselves.  When the bill came we noticed they had charged us 40eoros...YES 40 EUROS FOR THE SMALL CAKE. I WAS GOBSMACKED.....apparently it was 8e each !!!  not wanting to create a scene i paid the bill . in effect the cake( which was average ) had cost us more than 40euros because i had given the waiter a good tip earlier.    On the last day we asked reception how much a taxi would be to the airport...they said 150d/person = 600d= 60e  we declined their offer and took a taxi right outside for a total of 100d ....YES 100d.    It left me thinking that these hotels think that just because you are from the uk or europe they can charge what they like.....cmon Radisson show some class and customer service skills especially when people are celebrating things !!!!!  THIS SORT OF BEHAVIOUR LOSES CUSTOMERS  i would have given a better score had i not felt ripped off.    on a positive the room was clean and spacious and hotel had a good pool although not the biggest.,Date of stay: July 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mazsaleem

Review:  I went with my boyfriend to the bar at Lila there was no greetings no host no manager to welcome us literally no one who escorted us to the table.  We sat ourselves and took us ages to get the server attention... then a server noticed we were looking around and approached us with the menus and a smile after 20 minutes a waiter came to take our order then again we had to wait for too long to receive the drinks and there was no tapas at all.  It‚Äôs such a shame for such a city center hotel to have such a faulty service where they could be the best in town!  The best part of that place that made me stay for longer and make me come back when I‚Äôm back to Morocco is the band. I could tell it is the best show in Marrakech very talented and professional performers was there 2 times in a raw and there was different singers who were just perfect the lead guitar player was just incredible with the solos and presence on the stage with a great eye contact and smile with the audience great interaction with the guests and was even adapting to guests requests he should be the manager of that restaurant i think he could manage that restaurant even better than the director of food and beverage.  Again it is a shame to have such 2 bad experiences but you have an amazing band and lead guitar who makes it up for that place.  I will definitely come back on July with my boyfriend just for the band with no expectation for the service!

Room  Very well equipped with nespresso coffee machines fridge iron & iron board large balcony seating futons and a large desk/office space that made me wish I was there on business rather than leisure. The bathroom is massive with a walk in shower drying rack two sinks bathrobes and separate toilet. All very chic and minimal.    Food  We had breakfast lunch room service all amazing. In comparison to the UK prices are good but comparing to Marrakesh prices are spicy. Good quality however.    Location  The hotel is about 20 minutes walk from the M√©dina 5-10 by taxi (pay max 20 DHR for 2 ppl 50 DHR for large taxi 4 ppl +). We enjoyed being at this location more rather than staying in the M√©dina. While the souks are good fun it does get a bit tiring so getting out of there felt nice.    The area Gueliz is very nice felt safe with plenty of restaurants and shops. It is also about 15 mins to the airport (70 DHR by taxi).    Spa  Amazing massage. Again very good prices in comparison to the UK. It was about 450 DHR for 30 mins 660 DHR for 60‚Äô and 990 DHR for 90‚Äô. Didn‚Äôt get to try the Hammam and to our disappointment one couldn‚Äôt use it with a massage. But the massage itself was amazing. Would definitely recommend.

They also had a table tennis üèì.  After reading all reviews I was looking forward to seeing the band but it must have been due to Ramadan that they did not play one night.

We were upgraded on arrival which obviously helped but our rooms were spacious clean and comfortable with enormous bathrooms.    The breakfast was truly outstanding and everything was swiftly replenished if it ran low and the food in the restaurant generally was of a very good standard and fairly priced.    The location suited us well it's a taxi ride to the Old Town but the hotel is within a ten minute walk of several of the city's best restaurants and has a supermarket underneath.    The staff were extremely friendly and helpful.    The only slight criticism I can level is that the pool is on the small side for serious swimming and was crowded at times there were just about enough sunbeds.

Our 5 nights stay was very pleasent. Room cleaning was good. Breakfast lot's of choices. Coffee not as strong as I like.

The only thing that made me discover the hotel is the band at the bar they have very good taste of music they adapt to guests requests and they even I terrace with guests which made the ambiance better than epicurien or any other place for those who want to have an experience with live music.  The disappointing part is that there‚Äôs not live on Sunday and Monday and they finish early.  As a local I don‚Äôt like to go out on weekends I like to go out on mondays with my friends and the only destination is radisson blu but for sure we cannot.  Something that really bothers me a lot and which made me stop going there with friends is that the live finishes at 23:00.  It‚Äôs marrakesh and the live finishes at 23:00 we wanna drink more and eat more but when the music stops we ask for the bill and we go somewhere the ambiance is mediocre.

"Radisson Blu Hotel, Marrakech Carre Eden",Paul K wrote a review Apr 2019,50,Outstanding service and great hotel,This was our second stay in Marrakesh. The hotel is about 15min walk to the M√©dina. Nearby there are loads of cafes and restaurants. The things I really liked about this hotel was the fact that it was close enough to the centre but also quiet. There is a heated pool (absolutely brilliant!!) sun loungers a really well equipped gym (better than a lot of hotels in the uk...) and a spa. My partner had a hamman and I had a massage both were great.  The thing that sets this hotel apart from others is the amazing service from all the staff nothing was too much effort. Our daughter lost her toy and the staff managed to find it and it was returned to us.  The only down side is the price of drinks and food at the hotel so we tended to eat out for lunch and evening meals (there are lots of places nearby so not a problem)  We will definitely be going back and would highly recommend.,Date of stay: April 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulkK8077AB

"Radisson Blu Hotel, Marrakech Carre Eden",Andrew D wrote a review Apr 2019,20,"Rooms Dreadful, Pool Area Nic","I will start with full disclosure. I am a lifetime ""Titanium"" level for the new Starwood ""Bonvoy"" program and as such my expectations were high.    However the rooms left much to be desired. Examples - there was no real ""bathroom"" in the room as the tub ""room"" and the toilet ""room"" were there just as you walked in on your left. The sink was staring at you right at you when you enter. The tub had only a handheld wand to shower with (as well the the tub spigot) which i was not use to. As such trying to shower was a challenge and I wound up flooding the floor in the room (no separate bathroom). I got better as the week went on but....... The room I was given was looking over a side street was was very noisy. They had a balcony but nowhere to sit (no chairs even though there was room). I always have the A/C on all night (personal preference) but half way through the night it shut off (which woke me up with heat flashes). I had to fiddle with the thermostat pull my key card in/out of the room enable slot a few times walk around the room a few times and it kicked in. On the first morning there we lost water in the hotel (""generator issue"") which made preparing for my business meeting quite challenging. Was I in a third world hotel?    After a few days there I realized my colleagues had much better rooms. I guess i was unlucky.

Our room was cozy and very well decorated. Loved the open bathroom concept as well. The staff was very welcoming and helpful and the breakfast was very diverse with a lot to choose from.    Some space for improvement:  1 - If two or more people are staying in one room you should provide more toiletries as one of each is not enough;  2 - a fan should be added to the shower cabin as it is a closed space with no aeration unless you leave the shower door open;  3 - in a superior hotel it is expected that when they clean the room if the iron board and iron are out that the cleaners put them back to the original place;  4 - the breakfast area should be able to accommodate more people. It was always packed in the morning and it was hard to get a place;  5 - didn‚Äôt fancy the fact you can smoke in the bar area (indoors).

The location is great and the hotel is lovely. We had a suite at the end of a long corridor which we found perfect as there was no noise from the corridor - it was perfectly quiet at night. We had an issue with the shower when we arrived but it was fixed immediately after we reported it. We had no real view as our room looked out on a street but again it was very quiet so we didn't mind. The pool area is lovely - it was cold weather when we were there but I loved that my kids could still enjoy the pool as it is heated and we know have endless videos of my kids performing for us underwater filmed through the glass wall of the pool. Its also a beautiful area to sit and have a drink. And finally we loved the spa - the manager at the hotel and the staff at the spa went above and beyond for us when it came to getting us certain spa services and we remain so grateful for that. It was a highlight of our stay in Marrakesh. The only part of the hotel we got a little frustrated with was the dining room. The service was a bit slow and sloppy - it took a long time to get anything and we didn't find the service to be up to the same standards as the rest of the hotel. Another review mentioned the dim lighting in the dining room during breakfast which I agree with - it was hard to see what the wonderful array of food actually was. A bit more light and some labels would help.

But some of the staff need some people skills training.  On arrival we were asked for the credit card which the hotel was booked with my daughter booked this holiday for us as she was getting married. She asked the hotel prior if it would be an issue that the card wouldn't be present on arrival she was told no. However on arrival it was a big issue. The woman on the desk demanded the card was presented for any use of the Spa or other facilities. My daughter had to come and help with our check in. We tried to explain that we had no intentions of using any facilities and requested to see a manager. At first the manager refused to come to the desk to see us which was visible from a little box behind the desk. On asking a second time both a man and woman came out. Initially the woman asked us for 7000MAD the manager then stated to me she was willing to drop this to 1000MAD and that it was for damages and security. A little more understandable and feasible. I stated that her colleague didn't state this prior hence why I was so frustrated. She said she was happy to take it in cash and gave me a receipt however I used another card just for credit insurance.  The room was beautiful modern and luxurious. The shower was great and the toilet like a throne. The rooms were well cleaned. Shame we had no seats for the balcony for half our stay however. On obvious days such as weekends the bar was extremely busy. The swimming pool area had no more than 4 people at any given time. The fact it was heated was a nice touch. Never woke up for breakfast so can't comment on the food. The bar service sometimes was hit or miss despite being overly staffed in my opinion. The door staff are probably the friendliest of the hotel. Upon leaving we were slammed with a city tax which we thought was included in the original bill. And was told we had taken water from the mini bar! Which we hadn't and refused to pay as my daughter took us shopping for our own water and snacks nearly every day. Nice hotel but mediocre service.

"Radisson Blu Hotel, Marrakech Carre Eden",Gunilla58 wrote a review Jan 2019,40,Another good experience,We always come back to this hotel due to its very good location in Marrakech but mostly for the super nice service by the staff. A superior room on 5:th floor gave us the calm and feeling of exclusivity that we wanted. The hight of the day was always the breakfast although a bit full during Christmas Holidays the buffet was very rich and fresh. We would like to give a special honor to the morning staff who accomplished this in a very professional way despite a lot of hungry and not always polite customers. Thank you Hanane Amal Najat Zakia and all the rest of the restaurant personnell. Check out was very easy and quick thanks to Kahlid and Jamal. For those of you who are new to Marrakech the recommendation is to go to the hotel Spa after a busy day in the Souk.

"Radisson Blu Hotel, Marrakech Carre Eden",Bee999 wrote a review Jan 2019,30,Disappointing - Would Not Stay Here Again,This hotel was definitely not 5 star. The service was poor for several reasons  Our room was overlooking building site; hair dryer not working breakfast area over crowded.Thankfully we were only here for a short stay. The main concern staying here was our money was stolen at the Lila SPA from the changing rooms.There were no other customers there at the time except staff who were wondering in and out of the area.We reported it to the SPA manager who showed no empathy and was arguementive towards us. We did we receive any apology and we were made to feel we were lying about the whole thing.  We also reported it to the hotel receptionist who intentionally disregarded us and again we were just dismissed.We will not be staying here again as don‚Äôt trust the staff after this experience  We kept all our belongings locked in our suitcases/safe and would suggest anyone who stays here does the same.,Date of stay: December 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LoveTraveller999

The rooms were comfy and well appointed although they don't seem to do showers in a big way here - baths must be the thing here. The TV channels were plentiful and there was a fridge and all the amenities in the rooms.  The food was very good breakfast was a huge North African buffet with a strong French Influence although I struggled to see what some of it was what with low lighting levels and a change of policy of the winter clock change so it was dark until gone 8am.  The main Souk was about 25 mins walk straight down the road and there was a big shopping centre right next door including a supermarket with a fully loaded alcohol section which was handy.  It was disappointing that I didn't get any points for staying here as the company paid for it.

Location - good location in the new city right next to a shopping centre restaurants and shops. Half an hour's walk to Jema Al Fanaa and historical attractions.    Property - rooms were a serious disappointment. Lacking any character bland and poor design. In serious need of revamp. 1970s style rooms with ugly contemporary furniture and nothing to tell that you are in Morocco. No shower and each room was small being more of a studio than a double room. Poor finishes. Insufficient elevators meaning a long walk to the lifts for most rooms. Definitely not 5 stars. After much complaining and to Reception's credit we were finally allocated adjoining rooms that were a lot better than the ""superior"" rooms we were first allocated.    Restaurant- crowded at breakfast with large quantities of food but lacking in quality and variety - not 5 stars.

Two hours after checking out from the hotel further to a business seminar our seminar coordinator received a call from the management falsely accusing me of breaking a shaving mirror and taking the bathrobe with me. Hotel manager argued that I should have reported that the mirror was broken as it is ""my responsibility"" to make a health check of all the furniture at check-in.  I could see that it's totally unprofessional first because their was no check before my arrival of the furniture and furthermore accusing me of breaking a mirror they didn't check and that could be a serious health hazard for me. Not mentioning the necessary investigation they are supposed to make (hotel has cameras) before concluding to accuse their customer of stealing.    I would strongly suggest if not to avoid staying there at least to control all room furniture at check-in and request a formal check-out before leaving. Otherwise you may see yourself debited + accused of stealing hotel furniture.    Instead of addressing their internal issues this hotel tends to charge and accuse customers.

"Radisson Blu Hotel, Marrakech Carre Eden",Kok Siang C wrote a review Dec 2018,40,Overall satisfactory except regisration counter,We booked 2 rooms using our Radisson Rewards points for 5 nights and requested for twin beds rooms in the online booking. We requested for rooms close to each other during check-in and were given rooms with double bed instead. We have to get the rooms changed and were told that because we asked for rooms close to each other and they have decided to give us the double-bed rooms without telling the guests the earlier request (twin beds) was not fulfilled. Not happy with the check-in counter as I find them not effective (more than 1 hour to get the twin beds room) and they could be more friendlier. Despite being in gold status I did not get an room upgrade and the balcony view was facing the balcony of another building    Anyway the location and the rest of the hotel facilities were satisfactory. Breakfast is good as usual (never get disappointed with breakfasts from Radisson blu chain of hotels). Swimming pool is big enough for a nice swim. Excellent service from specific staff such as Mohammed in the breakfast restaurant.

The hotel is part of a larger complex including a shopping mall supermarket Starbucks and a couple of restaurants. Front desk was very helpful and friendly quick check in and out. The hotel is a 30 minutes‚Äô walk from the Jemaa el Fna and the Souk/ Medina. I was given a room on the 5th floor coming with a balcony facing the main street in front of the hotel. Nevertheless the noise from the street did not make it thru all very well damped.    Breakfast buffet is 5-star standard with the exception of the coffeemaker which is OK for a roadhouse but not an upscale hotel. Anyhow the rooms come equipped with a Nespreso machine so that¬¥s OK. I also found the pool hours a little strange. Talking a little swim after a long day? Forget it pool closes at 7pm. That would be OK for an outdoor pool in Scandinavia in November but not for Marrakech.

A lovely room with very spacious bathroom but view is of street rather than poolside and terrace. We were half board the content of which was not explained to us on arrival. Basically you can have 2 courses from a limited menu. This wasn't explained to us until day two and we had been served three courses the day before? There were six choices of starter main and dessert which sounds ample but quite a lot of fish and seafood which some of our party couldn't eat so very limited choice. The menu was the same every day. To be fair some waiting staff would let us order off the main menu if it was a similar priced meal but not all. I will say that everything we ate was very good we just had a lot of the same things over 7 days.

I love the fact that the pool and area is quiet and mostly empty daytime and livens up at night with locals coming to eat and drink here.  I love the free WiFi which works even around the pool area.  I love the bathroom and rain shower in my room  I love the TV channel that plays non stop movies (MBC2)  I love the fact that theres a coffee machine in the room but plenty of trendy coffee places and bars just a few steps away.  I love the large supermarket right under the hotel.    Turn left out of the hotel and a few blocks to find a fantastic place to eat or have coffee and watch the crazy traffic. Think it's called cafe Elite. Another block just past McDonald's and you have a newly built outdoor shopping area with a host of modern shops.    This hotel is definitely the modern part of Marrakech and a taxi for 20/30 dhs (¬£2) will take you straight up to the Medina in 5 minutes if you can handle the craziness the colour smells and heat....i can just about bare all of that knowing I have this peaceful little oasis of a hotel to come back to.    Breakfast has plenty of options although could be labelled as I have no idea what half the things are. Good to be adventurous though. Omlettes cooked to order are great. And yes I will definitely return here.    And yes I will only stay here on my return.,Date of stay: September 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tonyfZ9377DI

Well equipped gym.  Nice outdoor pool.  Excellent breakfasts.    We've just had a superb week in Marrakesh and chose the Radisson Blu as we like this chain.  I was holidaying with my young adult son so we had everything we needed here.  All the staff went out of their way to look after us and make us feel both welcome and comfy.  We loved the wide variety at breakfast especially the delicious freshly cooked omelettes.  The staff are excellent and work hard.  We needed a late check out and it was very kindly arranged.

It is an modern new hotel decorated tastefully with Moroccan accessories and vintage Moroccan movie posters. Jamal from the front desk upgraded us to a spacious comfortable suite and Amina provided us with delicious food and drink while we waited for our room to be prepared. The service is outstanding. The entire staff is very kind and helpful and do their best to accommodate any requests.    The only negative experience we had was securing loungers by the pool. They were all reserved by 8:00 am in the morning. A hotel of this size could use another pool area perhaps shallower than the current pool to accommodate small children.

"Radisson Blu Hotel, Marrakech Carre Eden",khd24 wrote a review Aug 2018,50,Pleasurable 5* Stay,My husband and I stayed at the hotel to celebrate our anniversary for four nights. This is an excellent hotel and is located in a perfect spot.    Hotel: Brand new hotel with excellent rooms. Our room had a balcony overlooking the very good view of the pool and silence area. Room was cleaned everyday and toiletries refilled. Room had a comfortable bed with iron tv and minibar. The room also has a ketttle with tea/coffee facilities. The design of the room was very modern with a hint of Moroccan touch. The was cleaned everyday to a high standard and the service was brilliant. Sayda who cleaned our room always did so with a smile and worked very hard to ensure room was to a excellent standard. The hotel has an excellent spa service an awesome Aquarium pool and a high tech gym with all the new top of the range equipment.    Location: perfect location next to very good restaurants ranging fast food such as McDonald‚Äôs and Burger King to fine dining. Also has very good cafes and dessert places nearby. Hotel is a short taxi ride like 5-8 min to the old town-M√©dina where you‚Äôll find Koutoubia Mosque souks and Jemaa el-Fnaa. Another 5 min drive in the opposite direction you‚Äôll find Jardin Majorelle. There is currency exchange outside on both sides of the hotel. The hotel it self is attached to a very good shopping centre with high street shops and fast food chains.    Staff: The staff at the hotel are fantastic and provide an excellent customer service. From security door man bell boy guest relations to housekeeping waiters/waitress and to reception staff to mechanical staff to spa staff all know their jobs and value of customer service. They helped us out a lot and advising us how much to pay to local taxi drivers helping us with our excursion- we did the hot air balloon excursion which was fantastic and safe. Also decorated our hotel room and provided us with a complimentary anniversary cake. Also advised us on which transport would be reliable and cost efficient take for trip to Agadir. Thank you to all staff.    Food: We were half-board so only had breakfast and dinner. Breakfast was buffet style food was good but was a slightly limited. Dinner again the menu didn‚Äôt offer a lot but the food was of high quality and taste. Water and drinks weren‚Äôt included and had to be ordered separately.    Overall we absolutely loved our stay at the hotel and really enjoyed the massage and hammam at the spa. We loved the location and the hotel is truly tremendous. What made our stay even more fabulous was the fact you had excellent Wi-fi connection in every part of the hotel so you could stay connected with the world and on social media. This hotel is very good for couples as were given absolute privacy and although we went during peak time the hotel is big enough that no one gets in anyone‚Äôs way which I liked.

Room service was absolutely excellent shoutout to Maryam who we adored! Breakfast is excellent too attentive staff and buffet style omlette station was really cool too! The swimming pool is regularly cleaned and is pretty deep for children so I would recommend you to bring floats if you have kids who want to swim but for casual swimmers the pool is great! Honestly this hotel is was truly the highlight of our visit location is also good too right next to Carr√© Eden shopping mall and a lively area to walk around in the evening. Even the security downstairs they were lovely gentlemen especially Ahmed I‚Äôm afraid we forgot a couple other names but hopefully they‚Äôll remember our faces as we will with theirs. Other than that this hotel is perfect for first timers as Marrakech the city itself isn‚Äôt exactly the perfect spot to take small children but this hotel is amazing.

"Radisson Blu Hotel, Marrakech Carre Eden",Linzii30 wrote a review Aug 2018,40,Amazing Hotel and service,We visited the hotel for a week at the end of July 2018. What can I say about this hotel nearly everything was simply amazing.    When we checked in we had 2 rooms (4 people) and I had requested for them to be connected. I was made aware prior to arrival that the connecting rooms were not available so was expecting this. But what I was not expecting was to be upgraded to a suite! The lovely lady Amina checking us in suggested to upgrade us so we could all be in one room. The suite was on the top floor and was beautiful the rooms the bathroom the views everything was outstanding.    The amenities were great too the pool was not vast in size but it was a good size and the hotel was not packed and we got a sun lounger everyday near the pool. The staff were amazing and on call for anything. They gave out free drinks on one very hot day which was a nice touch.    There was a kids club and I want to give a special thank you to Meena from kids club who was such a lovely person who had an actual interest in making the experience good for the kids. She was interactive bubbly and got the kids to socialise amongst themselves even if there was a language barrier. The kids club was also very clean with a tremendous amount of activities. My son did not want to leave the club and I usually had to drag him out.    The location is the best right in the city centre with everything walking distance.    Coming to the negative: I only have one negative comment to make and that is the breakfast. There was not much variety at all no toast only baguettes! You had to make your own tea/coffee and a few times the coffee machines weren‚Äôt working and no one had put in the milk or whatever else the machine needed. Also there was a sort of slow service with replacing things I don‚Äôt think I ever got a teaspoon to stir my tea as they were always getting washed. Also the staff at breakfast seemed not as friendly as the rest of the staff.    But having said this  I would still 100% go back the breakfast was a small negative in contrast to all the positives about this hotel.    It is family and couples orientated everyone is wonderful the hotel is clean and beautiful and the location is perfect.,Date of stay: July 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Linzii30

"Radisson Blu Hotel, Marrakech Carre Eden",Gunilla58 wrote a review Jul 2018,50,A relaxing oasis in a vibrant city,A perfect place to stay if you want to mix traditional and modern experiences in a relaxing setting. We stayed in a business room which was a real treat for a vacation stay. Large and wonderfully equipped with a balcony facing the inner court with its great pool area. I personally just love the super confy bed with crispy and fresh bed linen and the spaceous bathroom with nice amenities and very good towels. Housekeeping is very efficient meticulous and service minded. Breakfast is just a dream. This time we stayed a lot in the pool area during the day with its impressive service given by the pool staff. Always smiling carrying new towels fixing sun beds where you wanted them rearranging parasols and on top of this also serving drinks and snacks. All this in the hot Marrakech sun. They really are worth to be mentioned.  So if you want to be comfortably situated in the city center Gueliez close to a lot of restaurants fun shopping and nice cafes this is a very nice hotel to stay in. The entire staff is very service minded and brings the typical Moroccan hospitality that you would expect. You can easily take a taxi to the old town and the famous souk and Jemaa El Fna which you have to see. The ride is not more than 10 minutes and costs between 10-15 Dirhams in a small taxi petit taxi. If you are more than three people you need to take a large taxi  grand taxi for 50 Dirhams since the small ones are not allowed to take more than 3 passengers.,Date of stay: July 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Stockholm, Sweden",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gunilla58

"Radisson Blu Hotel, Marrakech Carre Eden",emmeemme2018 wrote a review Jul 2018,10,Radisson Blu not for for our family,Our awful experience started the moment we checked in. The lady who checked us in gave us this condescending look because our booking was for 2 adults and we had our two kids under 12 with us. When we booked online it indicated kids stay for free. The lady said the fine print was only 3 people are allowed in a room. So for a family of four be prepared to leave one parent or one child at home or pay more. Kids really don‚Äôt stay for free in other words. We have platinum status with another hotel chain. It‚Äôs hard to start loyalty to Radisson for our family of four with this kind of hotel policy. Maybe this hotel policy was not the receptionist‚Äôs fault but the way she looked and treated us was horrible to say the least. We paid $80 more during check in to accomodate the extra child? Total bill was $242 for one night keep in mind we checked at about 12 midnight. In the morning we were awakened by a hotel staff saying he had to check the mini bar even with the do not disturb sign on the door. Realizing he woke us up he just said he‚Äôd come back later. My son slipped when he was coming out of the shower your showers have serious flaws water from the shower goes to the area outside the shower. We are a family of four and there was only one small bottle of body wash. The towels provided were not even enough to wipe the water from the shower. The toilet didn‚Äôt flush well. We didn‚Äôt bring up these issues anymore because we knew we would just be disappointed with the response. We stayed again on a different night unfortunately from a booking already previously made. We got the same condescending look from another evening receptionist. Our recommendation do not say kids stay for free on your website when that‚Äôs not the case. Charge extra if you have to your condescending look is not necessary and overshadows whatever good things your hotel might have. Install shower curtains in the bathroom and waterseal your shower doors? If you are enthusiastic enough to charge for an extra person make sure you give the proper amount of amenities.,Date of stay: June 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Dallas, Texas",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emmeemme2018

There are some signs of wear and tear but nothing major. The rooms were well cleaned and made up each morning and again with a turn down service in the evening.

There were pots of really dreadful coffee and two automatic machines which seemed to dispense hot chocolate when the cappuccino button was pressed. Service was friendly and polite but no one seemed to notice that cups plates and cutlery frequently ran out. We only found teaspoons on the last morning.  Lunchtime food by the pool is of a good standard with plenty of choice and the service was efficient and friendly. Prices are reasonable for a hotel. The pool is warm and clean and has plenty of sun beds for lounging.  In the evening the bar area is a good place to spend time and the head barman Abdess looked after us impeccably. He was attentive friendly entertaining and full of useful local information. Exactly what you want of a good bar man.  Other reviews have been critical of some staff but we could not fault any of them.  If you are looking for local character then you won‚Äôt find it here but this is a very good mid priced international standard hotel.,Date of stay: May 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Hastings, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Colintoo

"Radisson Blu Hotel, Marrakech Carre Eden",aitelmekki wrote a review Jun 2018,50,Perfect location for exploring Marrakech,I have stayed at this hotel several times and it always lives up to my expectations no matter if I stay alone or bring my family. I can recommend the hotel for your holiday in Marrakech. You find the mix of old and new food and caf√©s and good shopping just around the corner. All kinds of transportations available should you like a taxi a Caleche or just a bus ride. The staff is professional and forthcoming besides being very kind and serviceminded. Rooms are fresh and tidy and breakfast is the best I have seen in a hotel. The pool area is rather busy so come in the morning. The afternoon could be spent in the Spa which is the best in town. If you want to work out you will find an unusually large gym with very modern equipment.,Date of stay: May 2018,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Stockholm, Sweden",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aitelmekki

"Radisson Blu Hotel, Marrakech Carre Eden",snowie38 wrote a review May 2018,50,An oasis of calm,This is a lovely hotel situated in the newer part of Marrakech Gueliz and about a 15 to 20 minute walk to the Medina. Its a very cosmopolitan and relaxed area where people were less conservative in how they dressed and there were lots of resturants cafes and bars/clubs. The hotel in next to the big shopping centre.    Once you enter the hotel the hustle and bustle is gone and is really calm. The hotel is beautifully decorated and the service from all staff we encountered was excellent.    Breakfast is great - a massive selection of food and there is a fresh omelette station too.    The pool area is really lovely and a welcome break from the business of the medina where you can sunbathe and order cocktails to your lounger.    The bar is comfortable and is table service. If you drink wine the Moroccan Rose is lovely and much cheaper than the French equivalent available.    We ate dinner one night - massive rib eye steaks perfectly cooked. They also give you bread and soup to start at no additional cost.    We also had tapas at the bar and lunch by the pool. All the food we had was of a high quality and reasonably priced (at UK standards) obviously more expensive then eating locally in the Medina.    The rooms were stylish and comfortable.    The carre eden was the perfect base for us to explore Marrakech.,Date of stay: March 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Horley, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/snowie38

Excellent suites. very spacious and clean. Great for families. The hotel itself is located as part of what appears to be an upmarket area (I maybe wrong) and shopping centre. There are very nice restaurants around and the hotel food was excellent as well. The breakfast spread was extensive with live stations and amazing fresh fruit juices.

"Radisson Blu Hotel, Marrakech Carre Eden",J0anned568 wrote a review Apr 2018,40,Quiet but central,This hotel is built on top of a shopping mall in the centre of a busy retail area with lots of people around in the afternoon and evening. Despite this it was very quiet in our room and very unhurried and private. It is an easy 20-25 min stroll to Koutoubia Mosque and Souka and about the same distance to the Yves St Laurent Gardens. There are plenty of options to eat in the surrounding district at all price points.    The hotel seems designed for small groups and business travellers rather than larger groups so it has a more sophisticated but relaxed feel about it compared with other hotels we stayed at in Morocco. Entry is at street level but reception is on 2nd floor. You often need to change lifts to get to the upper floors which sometimes can make it a bit slow.    The room was a reasonable size with space to spread out our luggage. It was sunny during the day but very dark during sleep time. We were some distance from the lifts at the back of the hotel but this was not really a problem. The bed was comfortable. The room had an open style bathroom with only the shower and the toilet in closed spaces. This resulted in us having limited space to hang our hand washing a necessary task when on long trips and the laundry prices were big city prices. Many other rooms have separate bathrooms so it might be worth asking for one of these.    Breakfast was buffet style with an extensive cold selection and a more limited hot selection although there was a crepe and omelette station. We also had a drink in the bar which was a bit smoky but the atmosphere was good. We did not use the pool but it looked quite inviting if the weather had been warmer.,Date of stay: April 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Canberra, Australia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J0anned568

"Radisson Blu Hotel, Marrakech Carre Eden",Livingintuscany wrote a review Apr 2018,40,"Lovely Stay, some areas for improvement",We had a lovely 3 night stay. The hotel is very well located close enough to the Souk to be able to walk there but far enough away that you can enjoy a little more peace and quiet. We were a family of 4 2 adults and 2 children. We had a 2 bedroom suite which was really great with a lovely lounge and wrap around balcony facing onto the street (was well insulated so no noise disturbance). I applaud the hotel on letting us check in early and also check out late their flexibility was greatly appreciated. I do think though the reception could do a better job selling the facilities of the hotel we were left sitting for 10 minutes waiting for our room keys and then we were handed them without any explanation of breakfast wifi the pool the spa. We only received the information on requesting it. Bottled water is provided by the bed every evening which is nice I would really recommend that this is provided on arrival as well. We had a couple of small issues with our room the reception staff promptly called the housekeeping manager who came promptly and fixed them which was great. We had lunch each day at the hotel restaurant food was good service was mixed depending on who you had serving you there are a lot of stagaires floating around who don't seem to be given much guidance on what to do. One server was excellent Zakia (I think was her name) she was our first server and by far the best one. The service by the pool was very poor the gentleman taking drinks orders (dressed in a poolboy uniform) was very grumpy and unhelpful. 4 times I had to ask for a towel. Difficult to order drinks shortage of umbrellas. Breakfast was ok not bad not the best I have ever had the breakfast bar doesn't seem to be replenished too often in the last hour of service cups are running out tables are not being reset coffee is poor. You see what appear to be managers (dressed in blazers) walking around talking to staff but you don't honestly feel their contact with guests to understand how the stay is going if anything can be done etc. In spite of my negative remarks we had a very enjoyable stay I recommend this hotel and hope some of the service issues get addressed.,Date of stay: April 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Canton of Geneva, Switzerland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Livingintuscany

However the reason I am downrating in so much is the rip off excursion that was misadvertised. They sold us a WHOLE day trip to the atlas mountains for 500dhr per person (5 of us so approximately 200 quid in total). What this turned out to be was a 45 minute car journey with a car driver who didn't speak english to a point in the mountains where our driver just dropped us and didn't tell us where we were. He then asked us to pay another man to guide us around a trail. We couldn't have done this ourselves as he dropped us away from the trail. Then at the end at approximately 1pm he said in broken english/french that he was taking us back to the hotel. So we essentially paid 200 pounds for a half NOT FULL day excursion with no guide.

"Radisson Blu Hotel, Marrakech Carre Eden",PEZMOM3 wrote a review Jan 2018,40,OK and of interest to sabbath observers,First the hotel: Nice enough but you must be on a business level floor if you want a full bathroom all in one place. Clean but if I did not have to be walking distance to certain places on Saturday I would have stayed somewhere else. The staff could not be more friendly. The food was plentiful and good but the elevators are incredibly slow you have to switch elevators to get from ground level to your room unless you are lucky enough to catch one that goes to the upper floors. It is situated on top of a mall is walking distance (within 20-25 minutes) to the square the Marjorelle Gardens and YSL museum and other places of interest. Being on the business level floor does not get you a lounge but it will make your stay more pleasant. Those rooms are not all the same so be sure to ask about the things that matter to you (balcony? size of room?) before you book. On a less important note don't skip the desserts. they are fabulous.,Date of stay: January 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,CONNECTICUT,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PEZMOM3
"Radisson Blu Hotel, Marrakech Carre Eden",Naz H wrote a review Jan 2018,50,Excellent Service,I booked this hotel months in advance for my sisters 30th Birthday. I had several email communications with Insaf in reservations and Siham from the guest relations team they were very helpful prior to our arrival. The staff made arrangements for every request I had for this special occasion. On arrival at the airport we were greeted by the hotel driver Abdul in a luxury car. He held a sign saying Happy Birthday to my sister. He is extremely polite and knowledgeable. I would recommend booking transfers with the hotel as it's very reasonably priced and hassle free. Upon arrival at the hotel our room was beautifully decorated with balloons towel design decor on the bed a wonderful birthday cake and a gift for my sisters birthday. Each of our requests were dealt with and we had a comfortable stay. I would like to thank all the staff who we communicated with and whom made this stay exceptional. I would like to also specially thank Abdul our driver reception staff Sonia Jamal Mohammed and all the bell boys to include Kamal. Not to forget the guest relations team Siham who organised and planned everything months in advance and Loubna who assisted us during our stay. Finally a big thank you to the restaurant team who served us during breakfast and dinner. We loved the food and the whole experience.

We requested Sushi which wasn‚Äôt on the dinner menu. It was granted. Perhaps because as we asked the Chef was walking by who was more than happy to accommodate our request. And wow what a presentation came out. I do not remember the Chefs name but thank you sir.    I requested a single AAA battery (almost not granted). Granted.    Overall - the gym the spa the restaurant the bar the staff the entire grounds for me was perfect.    The only one issue I had was in the bar smoking is permissible as it is in many establishments but because of it I did not sit in the bar area therefore could not enjoy the entertainment the hotel had ever night.    I thought smoking indoors was banned I guess not.

"Radisson Blu Hotel, Marrakech Carre Eden",clarkUtvik wrote a review Jan 2018,40,This was a great experience - overall.,As a journalist ‚Äì i always start with the critical: the guard outside the hotel seems hostile until they know who you are ‚Äì it stretches down. The room service is good; but too slow in the restaurant in the evening. The food is ok no more. The patio in the back yard is big but the pool seems dirty. But a perfect place to have a glas of wine and relax.    What draws the whole experience was the room. We have one of the corner rooms located on the top floor. A huge room with 50 meters balcony. Large surfaces with beautiful decoration. A large bathroom and a delicate shower room. All rooms have a door to the balcony. This is the nicest room I have ever experienced in Marrakech.It is very attentive to you and it gives a good feeling.    Service wise and with the BIG players like Grand Central Hotel in Barcelona The New York Palace and the Thief in Oslo and others Raddison in Europe - unfortunately this is not entirely world class. It's too tired and needs a heart from the staff. Its management fellows.    But I would love to go back here - to discover more from the what the hotel offers.

"Radisson Blu Hotel, Marrakech Carre Eden",Lorreine wrote a review Nov 2017,50,"Great Hotel, excellent location, super staff.",We had really wanted to stay in a Riad but the choice was overwhelming. The thing that put us off was the fact that guests kept saying how hard it was to find this or that Riad. In the end we decided to go for the more well known brands about a mile from the Medina. We knew we were close to a shopping centre but we didn‚Äôt realise that we were actually above the centre itself. We were in room 4010 and although we could hear the band if an evening time it generally finished around 11. The staff were all incredibly welcoming and helpful and the food (we only ate breakfast) was superb. Cannot fault the breakfasts at all - even though it was November is was warm enough to eat outside we were so full we didn‚Äôt need any lunch. Our room was great - plenty of room and storage. Some comments have been made about the showers (there is a big overhead shower and a smaller one about chest/waist high) but we had no problems at all. Each had a different use. The pool area (being on top of a shopping centre wasn‚Äôt the most attractive) but we liked it the outside drinks/restaurant area was attractively lit of a night time. It was a super location. We would walk out of a night and it was like being in Oxford St there were simply thousands of people strolling. There were a number of very good restaurants close by and a taxi to the medina was 50dhm. We took a taxi to the Jardin Marjorelle and it cost 20 dhm. The biggest negative for us was the cost of drinks and food (drinks even soft ones cost a lot!). A small lager was around ¬£7 and a bottle of water ¬£5. Gin started at ¬£11. There is a carrefour in the shopping centre so we popped in there and bought our goodies from there.

"Radisson Blu Hotel, Marrakech Carre Eden",arun c wrote a review Nov 2017,40,A heady mix of Berber and French cultures!,We have been to Marrakech several times and in the past have stayed in various hotels. However this time we decided to stay in the heart of the city.    We were amazed when we were upgraded to a suite by Khalid on the reception desk. He was most helpful and represented all that Berber hospitality is all about.    The suite was huge as was its wet room. Most rooms looked down upon the infinity swimming pool.    Room service was prompt although the in room dining menu was restricted.    The turndown service and room cleaning service was superb. There was no shortage of water or that of the coffee capsules for the Nespresso coffee machine in the room.    Breakfast was a bit of a let down though. Although the omelette station produced the desired quality of omelettes the fried eggs were dry with broken yolk. The small sausages were hard and tasteless. They could have provided a wider range of fresh fruits for a country like Marrakech for eg. Pomegranates which they grow in abundance but it was conspicuous by its absence! However the presence of Ilham in the restaurant restored what it lacked in its quality of food offerings. She was gracious welcoming and could not do enough for all who entered her domain! An asset to this hotel!    The security provided by the hotel was refreshingly uncompromising! There were these men in black suits across the main entrances to the hotel.    Beer was expensive at around ¬£8 a glass.    Concierge services and the reception staff were polite and professional but the one touch staff responding to calls could be a little more polite on the phone.    The hotel is well located for those who wish to be in the centre of commerce and the city‚Äôs tourist attraction.

"Radisson Blu Hotel, Marrakech Carre Eden",Makebetter wrote a review Nov 2017,40,Nice hotel but small pool and service in restaurant average,I stayed 4 nights here in November and found the hotel to be very modern with clean and comfortable with good facilities. Service was good everywhere apart from the single restaurant in the hotel.    The hotel is located about a 20-30 minute walk from the main square in the Medina. A taxi ride costs around 20 dirhams. There are plenty of cafes and restaurants within walking distance of the hotel and the Carre Eden shopping mall is basically next to the hotel.    The check-in was quick and I was shown the pool fitness centre & restaurant which are all on the same level as the reception desks. The one frustrating thing I found during my stay was that the elevators were programmed to automatically stop at the reception level whether you were wanting to go to a lower or higher floor - this therefore wasted a bit of time each time the elevator was used.    My business room had a modern decor and was large comfortable and with all of the necessary amenities (TV tea/coffee inclduing a coffee machine kettle hairdryer safe minibar). The adjoining bathroom had a lovely large walk-in shower in a wet area - this worked well and the large space was great. The rest of the bathroom was also large with two sinks and an area with a couple of hooks to hang items. There was no bathtub although this didn't affect me. The cleaners were very thorough with their cleaning every day and replaced all of the amenities in the bathroom and bedroom.    In terms of the facilities the fitness centre had plenty of modern equipment but the outdoor pool was small with only 30 sun beds around it; whilst i visited at an off-peak time and this wasn't an issue I'm certain that if you visited during the summer months it would be difficult to find a sun bed and therefore difficult to relax by the pool. The water in the pool also didn't feel as though it was heated which would have been nice as the weather was chilly particularly in the mornings.    The single restaurant in the hotel has both indoor and outdoor seating and the outdoor seating is very comfortable with a nice ambience; breakfasts were good with a plentiful choice of fresh fruit salads cold meats cooked food (meat and vegetables) breads an egg station and fruit juices. I dined at the restaurant a couple of times of dinner and whilst the a la carte menu is not huge it has sufficient variety of foods and a nice drinks menu; the cooked meat i had was well prepared and presented. The one problem was with service during dinner - even though the restaurant was not that busy the staff were inefficient and in one case unfriendly as well; orders were taken for tables before dealing with my own ordered drink resulting in a wait time of almost 10 minutes for a single drink which is very poor (one staff member in particular was poor). Also even when you physically went to the bar to order a drink waiters would carry on with other menial tasks before finally serving resulting in a wait time of several minutes.    The hotel has free fast wifi throughout the hotel which was very useful.,Date of stay: November 2017,Trip type: Traveled solo,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Makebetter

Everything in the hotel is generally well appointed (with the exception of whomever decided to put towel bars on the front of the sinks- the obviously don't shave) and the staff were extremely cordial and helpful.    The singular largest detractor was an odor in / around the rooms / hallways of the hotel. The first room they gave me reeked so badly that I asked them to re-clean it; they did and then it simply smelled of the awful odor AND cleaning detergent. They gave me another room where the odor was still present but not as ""knock you down"" bad. I'm not sure if it is sewer gas mildew in the carpets / carpet cleaner or some other kind of off gassing but the smell was present in the carpeted hallways of the hotel as well.",Date of stay: November 2017,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Moscow, Russia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JCW703

All our usual expectations were filled and even surpassed. The ""yes I can"" pins the staff is wearing is not only there to look fancy but really means a lot.

Their Josper oven is a plus. We are always amazed by the location and the quietness of the hotel: In the heart of the City (gueliz neighborhood) close to most of the touristic places (jamaa elfna koutoubia jardin majorelle YSL museum etc.) and still very cosy comfy and quiet.

"Radisson Blu Hotel, Marrakech Carre Eden",mariiiab wrote a review Nov 2017,50,A wonderful week at the Radison. 11/10,"We have just got back from a 6 night stay at the Radisson Blu. The hotel looked amazing in the photos but was even better in real life. The location was perfect for us - plenty of places to eat nearby and above the Carre Eden Mall which was handy for a little bit of shopping. Also only a 15 minute walk to the main town square and easy to pick up a taxi to the many historical sites around Marrakech. (around 20 dihrams)    We had a lovely warm welcome from Sonia on the front desk who checked us in quickly. There was a holding fee to pay in case we used any services but when we explained that we were on a tight budget Sonia kindly agreed to waive the fee.    The hotel itself is in the newer part of town (Gueliz) and felt like a peaceful oasis away from the hustle and bustle of the rest of Marrakech. The whole hotel is very modern clean and with all the security feels very safe too. Our room was large and spacious and I loved the little touches like ""Welcome to the hotel Mr Rahman"" message on the TV screen as we entered our room. We stayed in room 3074 and had a pool view which was beautiful. The rainfall shower was excellent and the bed was large and comfy. The cleaning team cleaned the room thoroughly every day and gave us fresh bottles of water etc. The heated pool was lovely and the spa looked great too although we didn't have time to get a treatment there.    The staff in this hotel are superb and they really can't do enough for you. Everyone is so friendly and welcoming and made us feel at home. We were so sad to leave! We had breakfast one morning and there was a wide selection to choose from with a live egg station and plenty of fruit cereals pastries etc. There is a live band in the lounge most nights and we really enjoyed watching them play.    We absolutely loved our stay in the Radisson Blu. I would highly recommend it to anybody and if I went to Marrakech again I would definitely stay there again.

Our room was overlooking the street (no noise at night) and it was interesting to people watch over the balcony while sipping a cup of tea or coffee. The room was spacious good working hot & cold shower fridge TV safe clothes rack and more more. The breakfast had a huge selection but was repetitive. On our third and fourth day breakfast didn't excite us anymore. But hey! Who would get tired of freshly squeezed orange juice and mint tea!? Dinner however on their ala carte restaurant was superb! I even decided to spend my birthday dinner here. We had steak and seafood pasta - delicious! And a sip of smooth Moroccan wine to finish the night. I was so impressed with the wait staff (I forgot her name though) because she gave me a birthday cake for free! Housekeeping were friendly and prompt. Though there were times when the room service was slow but they headed to my every request anyway. So it didn't matter. They even had a power adaptor (for our charges) available. Great ambience in the bar with bands to liven up the night. Concierge was helpful with getting around Marrakech.

"Radisson Blu Hotel, Marrakech Carre Eden",Dan S wrote a review Oct 2017,50,Ideal modern hotel for a business trip,I stayed at this hotel overnight on business and I was not disappointed. I was upgraded to a junior suite which is bigger than my apartment back home so space wise I had more than I knew what to do with. The beds are big and comfortable pillows are soft and plentiful and the air conditioning is quiet and did not disturb my sleep. My room had a balcony that looked out onto the pool area and in the lounge area there was a Nespresso machine for a morning coffee. Best of all rooms are completely sound proof; so not being woken at 2 am by the couple next door rolling in from a club. Decor is modern and whilst not overly 'Moroccan' there are subtle touches such as the tiling and pictures that remind you where you are. Exercise facilities are exceptional; everything you could want including the possibility of yoga or aerobic classes. They also have a Hammam which looked good but I did not have time to have a treatment. Breakfast was very good and lunch was decent although possibly a bit expensive. The white wine by the glass was dull but the gris was much better. Staff were excellent attentive and warm without being in your face and nothing was too much trouble. I appreciated the genuine-feeling greeting from everyone from the general manager to the housekeeping staff and felt genuinely well looked after. Additional features such as the glass-sided pool and live music six nights a week are a bonus and Overall I would choose this over say the Sofitel which although has a much more exciting facade is showing its age in places that matter such as the bathrooms. A really excellent choice close to the heart of Marrakech.,Date of stay: October 2017,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Maidstone, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dansM2863SA

"Radisson Blu Hotel, Marrakech Carre Eden",TheYoungMonk wrote a review Oct 2017,40,Beautiful and serene property with great food,We stayed for 3 nights at this property during our first ever visit to Marrakech. The hotel is well located in the city and has good access to key sites (15 minutes away by taxi but make sure to agree on the fare before boarding as taxi drivers cheat a lot and dont use the meter).    The rooms are well sized (although ours had a slight problem with the plumbing in the bathroom - but it was quickly fixed). The breakfast spread is very impressive and you need to dedicate A LOT of time to enjoy it fully :-) We also enjoyed the lunch (served by the poolside) and the dinner (served in the bar/lounge area with live band playing every night). The bartender is extremely flexible and knows his drinks! He will even prepare something off the menu (like he did for us) if you instruct him well.    All rooms face the pool. The property itself is located next to a mall so you have ease of supermarket and shopping.    The staff speaks English well (a rare feature otherwise in Morocco) but we were let down by the Concierge desk lady who tried to overcharge us for the excursion and also claimed (falsely) that the driver was English speaking.

The beds were so comfy and the amenities including the breakfast were awesome.    Be forewarned though: my other hotel was overbooked and I called from the lobby to the Radisson Blu to see if they had availability and to confirm the rate. I then took at 10 minute car ride to this hotel to get my room and was told the price had increased by some 100 euros even though I had literally just spoken to someone. I left in both despair and disgust but something told me to check online and I booked the same room at the previously advertised rate here at Expedia. Why try to scam/rip off people coming in from off the street? When I came back the same young lady that had given me the preposterous rate came over and ask if everything was ok- ha!

The service we received was amazing nothing was too much for them. The location of this hotel was perfect central to everything and only a 15 mins drive from Jemaa-al-fna. Ismail from guest services was a total credit to this hotel he sorted out all of our excursions recommended places to eat and always greeted us with a smile on his face. Hands down the very best guest services service we have ever received. If you are reading this Ismail thankyou. We had a junior suite very spacious and comfortable only thing I'd have changed was that we had the street view and would have been nicer to have the pool side view. The pillows are extremely soft which took a lot of getting use to. The breakfast was nice but 7 days of the same became a bit tiresome would have been nice to just chop and change things and offer more variety on the hot food. The staff in the whole of the hotel had excellent customer service skills. Our boys used the kids club one of the days which they enjoyed. We used the spa while we were here too the spa staff let our boys stay in the relaxation room and looked after them while we had our hamam and massage which was really good of them. All in all a fab experience wouldn't stay anywhere else if I was visiting Marrakech again.    One word of warning - when we got to the airport we were charged 250 MAD which is excessive as we only paid 70 MAD when we were leaving. So be careful of the airport taxi drivers you should only expect to pay a max of 100 MAD from the airport to this hotel,Date of stay: August 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/965afshaa

The hotel has a very good location nice and clean rooms very cool pool but the key asset of the hotel is it's staff especially the front desk ladies. Upon arrival to Marrakesh we have discovered that all our baggage was lost (in fact we got it back in our hometown 13 days later) one can hardly image the level of the frustration a person is facing if he hasn't been in such a situation. But the front desk ladies particularly Amina and Lubna were more than just helpful. They made us feel welcomed and home with providing extra towels changing our room with a quieter one and even coming with us to the airline office as we didn't speak Arabic or French. At the end all the hotel including the general manager was involved in our search for the baggage.

Aircon sometimes made our room smell like a hamburger...  Lovely decor.  Breakfast - quite a good selection. Loved the 'egg cooking station ' where you could get yummy omelette made to order.  Nice pastry selection.  Pool - great area. Refreshing water in the Morocco heat.  Only complaint is the pool chair situation. A lot of people will 'reserve' sunbeds and not actually be poolside to use them til later in the day. A common practice in Europe which is inconvenient and I personally find rude.  Not enough chairs and sunbeds for the size of the hotel.  Service poolside is not overly attentive.  Staff are friendly and they 'try' to be helpful. Generally we found Morocco to be quite relaxed with service.  Reception staff lovely. Remember your name. Booked a camel tour for us.  Reservations staff - and maybe it's a language difficulty - sometimes no response to email requests.  Highly recommend getting hotel to organise car pickup from airport for 300 Dirham as it's a little confronting when you arrive for the first time at Marrakech airport.

In particular Fatima Zahra receptionist from the hotel spa and Siham front desk. Fatima Zahra encouraged me to have a massage at the Spa and it was truly a wonderful experience. I felt so relaxed and taken care of. Siham upgraded our room so we felt no inconvenience. Also We had our 18 month old son with us the week that we stayed and every colleague went out of their way to entertain him. I can't explain how much I loved staying at this hotel and how kind everyone was.

Said was very bad and very mean at that time. The cause of this experience I will never come back to this hot and I don't recommend this hotel at all. Needs improvement how reacts and treat good customers. When I came back asking for help that fan was working properly I had to wait for 15 minutes That he is talking to his coworker talking about little thing about life.

The staff tried hard to accommodate us as we have a few allergies and intolerances and they were keen to help. The spa was very relaxing and the massages were a high standard.    Only slight things were the service is quite slow by the pool and they aren't great with children's food menu options (specially for vegetarians there are none) but they do try and accommodate where they can! They also are unable to help ensure taxis are not ripping off their hotel customers which was a big issue for most guests.

As we arrived to the astonishing hotel we were greeted by 2 wonderful employees who kindly offered to transport our luggage to our luxurious room. Our room had a beautiful view over the tantalizing pool. As we enjoyed our first night with the comfortable beds we were awaken to explore the exquisite food that was offered to us. Once we devoured the tremendous food we returned to our room to discover that our room was refurbished to perfection by the amazing room service.Personally I would like to emphasize my gratitude towards Yassir for making our stay even better.

If you're arriving by train you can easily walk to the Radisson. Upon arrival we had three taxi drivers quote us 70MAD----do not fall for this! Luckily we took a few minutes to study the map and realized we were very close and a 10 min walk. The room was clean cool and quiet. The pool was refreshing on a 100 degree day! The bellmen were excellent in helping us navigate Marrakech. The only suggestion for improvement I'd make is for better pillows. They are extremely flat. When we requested additional pillows that were thicker/cotton they brought up a small comforter that was rolled up into a pillow case. Not exactly what we needed but appreciated the effort.,Date of stay: July 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Phoenix, Arizona",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Morgan88

The staff were so friendly and welcoming and were always smiling. The breakfast was so tasty too much to choose from and a great way to start the day. We had a couples Hammam at the spa which was really good and felt very relaxed after. My husband had a massage also and he commented it helped with his aches and pains (he has a shoulder injury). We were given a complimentary upgrade when the hotel found out we were on our honeymoon and the room was gorgeous such a huge and comfy bed! The pool area was nice to lounge around after breakfast and catching some sunshine. In terms of locations it's only around 12 minutes in a taxi to the main square but there are plenty of shops and great places to eat in the area around the hotel. I always stay with the Radisson group and have always have a great experience with them hence booking them for my honeymoon.

She refused to listen to reason so this resulted in my colleague canceling her check in and staying in her hotel...  Later that day we were spoken to realy rudely by the security...    Anyway this is the bad what saved the trip? why 4? Said who checked me in Khalid Who Checked Me out Loubna the manager who dealt with my complaint. not to mention the breakfast and cleaning staff. were all amazing.    Not only did they fully understand the complaint they went out of thier way to make it better! Loubna personally offered her apologies to my guest and went over and above to make it right. The team over all were AMAZING!    Despite the very useless Spa Manager I would highly recommend this place.  9/10!!!

"Radisson Blu Hotel, Marrakech Carre Eden",Rob_McDonnell_ wrote a review Jul 2017,50,Luxury Hotel 101.,We were travelling as a group of six friends none of whom had ever been to Marrakech before. To say we felt welcome would be an understatement.    This hotel has all the trappings of luxury without any of the stuffiness. Excellently located beautifully appointed and spotlessly clean it would be very difficult to fault the property in any way.    The pool area is beautiful and an ideal spot to avoid the midday Marrakech heat with an excellent menu of food and drinks (cocktails are outstanding). There's also a table tennis table which when a group of six are travelling together provides some intense competition!    Our business class room was very large with a huge bathroom and balcony overlooking the pool. As you'd expect towels and sheets were changed daily and the room returned to its original immaculate state.    As nice as the hotel is in itself the staff ensure it is a cut above. Absolutely everybody we came into contact with - from bar staff to reservations security etc. - was exceptionally friendly and welcoming always in a very sincere way. A special mention must go to Insaf in reservations who was very helpful in arranging everything prior to our stay.    Overall an excellent property in the heart of an excellent city - will definitely return.,Date of stay: July 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Kells, Ireland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rob_McDonnell_

I can only use one word to describe the past few days EXPECTIONAL. All of the staff members made us feel welcomed & safe. Especially being two young females travelling alone.    Looks exactly like the photos.  The hotel was very clean and modern.  We visited during Ramadan which meant that most of the clubs and restaurants were close . So we just relax and stay in hotel. But thank God for the hotel's DJ playlist we didn't feel like we missed out at all lol.    The only downside was the food  don't get me wrong the food was lovely but the hotel really lack on vegetarian/vegan options I was eating the same meal for 2 days because of the limited choices and most restaurants were close .    But apart from that I would like to thank all the staff members for making my birthday week so special.    Definitely would recommend this hotel  I can't wait to return back to Marrakech.

"Radisson Blu Hotel, Marrakech Carre Eden",Nabilfawzi wrote a review Jun 2017,40,"Stylish Hotel, Great Service, Short Ride Away from the Center",We stayed at the Radisson Blu Hotel Marrakech Carre Eden during our trip to Morocco in April 2017. About a 25-30 minute taxi ride from the airport it is situated on the very busy Avenue Mohamed V in the Gueliz section of Marrakesh. The way we planned our trip meant we had three days here at the beginning our trip and two towards the end as we spent the middle part of our stay was spent in the Atlas Mountains and the Sahara.    The only minor blip in our stay here happened on our first day. We had requested a cot in our room for our 14 year old son on our reservation and mentioned it again at check in. The front desk assured us it would be placed in the room shortly after we moved our bags in. We planned to explore the city stay awake and stay out all day on our first day so we were in no hurry. However after arriving back at the hotel after dinner the cot was still not delivered. (The method to contact the front desk is through an app that was impossible to navigate) I went back down to the front desk to mention the cot and they assured it would be up soon. About an hour or so went by and it required another trip back to the front desk and waiting while they made a call for the cot to appear.    Besides the issue of the cot the stay was great. The rooms were spacious the amenities were great and we had a view of the main street from the balcony. Note that the door to balcony is double glazed and street noise is virtually impossible to hear from the inside. The balcony also provides some great people watching as it overlooked the Starbucks on the other side of the street. This may be the only one in Marrakesh (or it seemed like one as it was packed both inside and outside until 11 pm every night). For young Moroccans it was the place to see and be seen. Surprisingly each morning the streets (especially outside the Starbucks) was spotlessly clean.    There is a breakfast buffet provided and it is very extensive - inducing pork products! I was surprised they actually catered to western pork needs (I stayed away). There is a cost associated with the buffet (although we were not charged for one of the days we ate there). There are plenty of cafe's serving traditional and French style breakfast and pastries about a 5 minute walk up Avenue Mohamed V.    On our return to the hotel for the tail end of our trip our rooms were not ready so the front desk staff took our luggage and asked us to stay by the pool and offered us free drinks (the drinks took a while to arrive and the thoughtful front desk staff member who helped us initially noticed we were still waiting and instructed the bar staff to bring us drinks).    Overall it was a pleasant experience. The staff have been trained well in the hospitality trade and we would stay here once again if visiting Marrakesh.    Other Tips  - There is live music on the second floor lobby by the bar. Sound carries so you may want to choose a room wisely.  - There is metal detector and a guard at the front entrance 24-7  - Bottled water was provided in the room as complimentary on arrival - though it was not replenished on day 2 and 3.  - if you decide to walk to Jamaa el Fna be aware it will take about 35 minutes but there is no shade.  - The pool is great and welcome on hot days.  - There is a Carrefour located in the shopping mall next door. This is a great place to buy bottled water and food for your daily trips in to the city center or before heading out to the desert or the mountains.,Date of stay: April 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Brooklyn, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nabilfawzi

Seating inside and outside on the terrace. (Second floor)    The Pink Prawn was looking for beer and as we were staying in a Riad close to the Jemaa El Fna alcohol was in short supply. We walked approximately 20 minutes towards the Gueliz area of Marrakesh which is much more modern and cosmopolitan than the Medina area inside the city walls.    For dinner we shared a mixed grill which was very nice. Service was great.    In truth although I couldn't fault the Radisson Blu it is very cosmopolitan but once inside the door we could have been anywhere in the world. Not a typical Moroccan/Marrakeshian establishment.

"Radisson Blu Hotel, Marrakech Carre Eden",brusselslombardis wrote a review Apr 2017,50,Sleek & Fabulous in Gueliz,We only stayed here for one night but after a whirlwind trip though the Sahara Desert the Marrakech medina and Essaouria this hotel was the perfect place to land! While we greatly appreciated the stunning beauty terrain history and antiquity of our travels through Morocco this brand new clean fresh and modern hotel was a slice of heaven for weary travelers! From check in to check out and everything in between our brief stay here was flawless. Every staff member was kind and helpful the pool area was beautiful great cocktails on the terrace and our early departure and car service was hassle free. The rooms were so plush and comfortable and it was nice to have a balcony overlooking the pool. A great location too - we walked a few blocks to the fabulous Grand Cafe de la Post for dinner and our kids liked having a shopping mall right next door. We've stayed in several meh Radisson Blus throughout Scandinavia and we felt this was the crown jewel of the chain. Although it's not a typical riad experience we were so happy to have ended our Moroccan adventure here at this beautiful comfortable and wonderful hotel.,Date of stay: April 2017,,"Brussels, Belgium",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brusselslombardis
"Radisson Blu Hotel, Marrakech Carre Eden",MariHenley_on_Thames wrote a review Apr 2017,50,Exceptional! Could not fault it!,We stayed in this hotel with our 2 boys (aged 3 and 5) for 3 nights.  The hotel has the perfect location in the modern Gueliz area near a shopping centre which made it easier when we needed to buy things for the boys.  We stayed in a suite which was beautiful and spacious (with a bathroom and a separate toilet).  It had a huge size balcony with table and chairs.  The rooms were very clean beds were comfortable bedsheets were changed daily.  Breakfast was amazing - huge selection and super tasty. Pastries were baked on the premises.  We were lucky to be there on Sunday when we had the Sunday brunch - absolutely incredible. Starters salads tagines BBQ fresh juices.  And deserts - lots of them and soooooo delicious!  We did have lunches and dinners at the hotel too - the quality is superb! Ambiance is very tranquil super enjoyable!  And staff - the most polite attentive friendly helpful! And so kind to the boys!  We all loved it so much!  And the biggest surprise for me was when on my birthday we got back to the room in the evening to find the most amazing cake made for me!  I could not tell you how tasty it was and how touched I felt by their kindness!  It just made our experience unforgettable.  We will definitely go back!  Just one little thing that could be improved - if the swimming pool could be heated :)  The boys did go swimming but the water temperature was 17C so my husband and I restrained from jumping in :)    Such a memorable experience!    Thank you all for making it happen!

I got a call in the morning from the agency saying your reservation is there go back to the hotel and get refund for one night which they didn't refund me yet.

"Radisson Blu Hotel, Marrakech Carre Eden",pittman64 wrote a review Apr 2017,30,Nice hotel with a good location but customer service needs improvement,The hotel is nicely situated in the city. It has a great restaurant option and I would argue someone should go to eat at the hotel even if they're not staying there overnight. The club/lounge area is fantastic and I love the live music! The rooms are spacious and clean; good air conditioning during a hot time when we visited.    I typically do not write these types of reviews but I have been at the hotel twice now and have encountered the same staff individual who is very confrontational and needs to focus on their customer service skills. This most recent time when checking out I gave my parking ticket for the staff member to validate. When I left the counter after paying my hotel bill I asked the staff member for a validated ticket. She immediately told me that it was already given to me a few minutes ago. I assured her I had never received it because I had just given her my old ticket. I made it a point to check my wallet pockets everything to show I did not have it. She responded by saying that while she had given me the ticket she would give me a new one since I did not believe her. This basically insinuated I was lying which I did not appreciate. This is unacceptable to be called a liar by a representative of a business that I have just given money to for their services.    I rate this hotel average because of the poor interaction with the front desk staff. I understand it's a new hotel so these issues may be resolved but people should be aware of the demeanor presented when they check-in or check-out.    One comment: I experienced great customer service by other staff members at the hotel; whether it be through room service the bar or restaurant. This should not reflect the entire hotel's attitude but one individual who works at the front desk.,Date of stay: April 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pittman64

"Radisson Blu Hotel, Marrakech Carre Eden",andrew h wrote a review Mar 2017,50,Flawless,A hotel regardless of the chain is only as good as it's staff. Radisson have clearly spend time and money creating a faultless team without a single weak link.    So. Why would you want to go to Marrakech to soak up the atmosphere and then hide in a western hotel.?  Well Marrakech is full on it's not Europe it's a city reinventing itself and it's noisy it's smokey it's filled with entrepreneurs wanting to improve themselves and sometimes it's just rather 'intense'  The Raddison is a great place to recenter yourself before heading back out again. Previously I have stayed in the heart of the medina and Gueliz was a pleasant change in pace.  The hotel is what you expect from Radisson. It's is beautifully built and the rooms are a good size the walk in shower is a nice touch and the air con the water pressure and the facilities all just work.  The pool was like a bath and the aquarium sides area nice touch as long as you don't let your other half take photo's. What do they say about aquarium sided pools? they make you look 10lbs heavier. Or maybe I just made that up.  The food in the Gueliz area is outstanding. There is a pizza place directly behind that serves wine stone baked pizzas and huge steaks all for very reasonable prices. Do go back a road or two and wander as the quality of cafe restaurants was extremely high.  The hotel is above a shopping mall filled with boring stores however it does have a carrefour where you can get Beer wine and crisps for the perfect balcony hour before getting ready for the night ahead.  Breakfast was fantastic with a huge selection of choices try all the fresh juices though as they are truly delicious even if I wasn't completely sure what they are.

"Radisson Blu Hotel, Marrakech Carre Eden",Laura wrote a review Jan 2017,40,Perfect location,We stayed here for four nights in January. The breakfast was good - fresh omelettes pastries fruit and hot food also loved the Tchaba teas.  The room itself was comfortable it had free toiletries a good makeup mirror and a free of charge safe. However when we first arrived there were no towels robes or slippers in our room. There was a kettle and tea/coffee but no complimentary water the balcony only had one chair (majority of pool facing balconies only had one chair) and the TV had one english channel.  The hotel is above a shopping mall on a busy road but when you're around the pool it's very relaxing and peaceful - the pool is also heated.  The location was perfect for exploring - there were a number of restaurants nearby as well as shops a market and a supermarket within the mall.  We enjoyed the bands evening entertainment at the hotel. The bar area had a good atmosphere cocktails were around ¬£10 each and they came with nibbles and the saltiest olives I have ever tasted!  We used taxis a few times most are out to rip you off - ask one of the guys working for the hotel out the front to get you a taxi and agree a price through him before you get in to try and avoid getting ripped off. We paid 50 dirhams for a taxi to the medina.  Having stayed at Radisson hotels before I was slightly disappointed that there was no complimentary drink on arrival or complimentary water in the room only one chair on the balcony no towels/slippers/robes in the rooms upon arrival a lack of service at the bar during the day and a lack of aircon in the gym. We enjoyed our stay but I think these added touches would make it feel more like a 5* hotel.,Date of stay: January 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/itchyfeet252

"Radisson Blu Hotel, Marrakech Carre Eden",arab wrote a review Jan 2017,50,Absolutely fantastic,I stayed at this hotel in December 2016 and I chose it to hold a conference for about a week so I used conference facilities as well as accommodation and other services.    Staff : staff members are very very well trained and professional in this hotel. Mr. Adil Rmidi from conference and banqueting is a very very professional well-mannered gentleman who can sort out the most difficult of requests swiftly efficiently and with a smile. Nothing was too much trouble for him and he will be your companion throughout your event making sure all your requests are catered for. He followed up with each of our requests and went through thick and thin to make sure we were comfortable (he event lent me his mobile charger and never requested it back). Not only is he easy-going and professional and never says no but he is also genuinely kind. I am Moroccan and I know this is a very rare quality to find in people working in the service sector and in other hotels.    Mr. Amine el Meriague was our contact person at the sale and marketing department and was out focal point before and during the event before Adil took over upon our arrival. Amine is of utmost professionalism a very genuine humble and professional person who made sure everything was sorted and well prepared during our arrival. And when I discussed catering matters with him he even called the head chef to discuss the content of our lunches and coffee breaks making sure every palate and request is catered floor. Amine marvelously coped with last-minute changes and challenges brilliantly and professionally.    Dealing with Adil and Amine was a pleasure seamless and hassle-free. Again it's not always the case in other comparable hotels in the city where staff is either useless or arrogant or both. Management should absolutely make sure these two persons keep their high motivation as this is crucial for guest satisfaction.    Conference facilities : top-notch modern and overlooking a nice garden (it needs a bit more plans though) as well as the pool. So from the meeting rooms filled of natural daylight (no none of them is dark) participants can get out to the garden for instance during coffee breaks or sit and bask a bit in the sun. Coffee break can either be served indoors or in the garden (of course Adil was there making sure everything was perfect). Interpretation facilities can be arranged through the hotel at very reasonable costs.    Food : coffee breaks and lunches were literally handcrafted with passion. There is a very experienced Moroccan Chef supervising a motivated team and making sure food quality and presentation is top notch. Main courses including local items (yes do request Moroccan specialities for your event if you can/wish you won't be disappointed) were of the highest quality and deserts were pieces of art. Very beautiful to look at and to taste (small tartelettes aux framboises chocolate etc). Lunch is served buffet-style for groups at the main restaurant which is bright and spacey. The √†-la carte restaurant at night was very expensive though and the menu rather limited (mains costing 25 euros minimum and an orange juice 6 euros but again this is a 5 star hotel). Breakfast was loaded with fresh items including freshly sliced fruit such as orange and melon a good selection of bakery items an egg station attended with a chef and providing also Moroccan pancakes (baghrir) as well as other delicacies. Do not expect smoked salmon though as it's not in the menu.The bread selection is very very good though as well as the viennoisies or danish pastry or whatever you wish to call it. The other huuuge plus of course is the freshly squeezed orange juice which you can help yourself to every morning. The breakfast room is very nice on the ground floor and very pleasant    Location : The hotel is located in the upper floors of a small shopping centre in the modern part of town a stone throw from the main railway station. The mall has parking facilities which hotel guests could use (don't know the exact cost though) a small carrefour supermarket for essential items and a busy starbucks at the street level. The rooms are different from one another you have those overlooking the pool which are business class rooms that tend to be slightly larger with an awkward desk arrangement though (this is a matter of taste) king or twin size beds that are very comfortable and white crispy sheets. Rooms facing the street are not noisy by any means and the configuration of some of them can even be nicer than business class rooms depending on the layout. You can choose a room facing the main street on the upper floor you will have a huge terrace and you can see some of the city buildings.    Gym : there is also a fitness centre with enough machines for a workout including a smith machine with a selection of weights seated chest press machine and shoulder press. There is however no barbell for biceps curls and the selection of free weights is rather limited (up to about 24 kg per dumbbell may be enough for a shoulder workout but not for proper chest dumbbell press sets). In addition you have a few running machines and a nordic walking and some bikers. The gym is definitely much better than other Moroccan hotels but sadly not equipped enough for gym goers. There is also some cable machines (those useless techno gym ones which are mostly designed for women). All machines are technogym and towels are to be requested at the spa area just like a bottle of water (no they don't have them on display at the gym).    Pool : there is also a very nice aquarium like swimming pool of about 20 meters long which is heated (not enough for cold days though) could be pleasant if it's sunny but no when it's very cold.    Spa : all services are provided here didn't test but was told that a visit to the Moroccan bath sets you back around 10 euros this does not include any treatment of course except from the possibility to enter the facility.    Bar : the bar gets a bit lively at night with a live band playing all nights sadly though smoking is permitted in the bar (which is a pity as those wonderful sofas will end up being torn and destroyed in no time). The band is very good although the music can be a tad loud but this is a great alternative to those that wish to stay in.    All in all staff make this hotel a gem of a place whether for private or professional visits to Marrakesh look no further go straight to Radisson tell them how to make you happy and let them take care of you. Rooms are top notch food is very good quality service is excellent without being too much. It is difficult to find a similar level of quality and service in Moroccan hotels but Radisson brings things to a whole other level. I will definitely be returning for future visits.    Management should look into :    - introducing a few delicacies at breakfast to make it wonderful instead of very good such as smoked salmon for breakfast this is standard in most hotels of this category. A Nespresso machine is also standard nowadays.  - having towels and bottles of water at guests' disposal when entering the gym as most do not know where to request them.  - filling in the empty space in the gym with extra machines for fitness freaks (no running machines are not enough a few barbells and standing cable machines and ropes would be much appreciated).  - making the hotel common area smoke-free including the bar. Smoking guests do tend to adapt and can have a smoke outside if they wish.,Date of stay: December 2016,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Brussels, Belgium",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/asalmane

The staff were all very accommodating and the room was lovely and clean. Only slight negative was that the pool was being refurbished for the first two days that we were there and we had no prior warning of this. They did however have access to the pool at the movenpick hotel near by that we could use.  Would really recommend this if your looking for somewhere not in the centre of the medina.

"Radisson Blu Hotel, Marrakech Carre Eden",zaakira wrote a review Jan 2017,30,Average,I have come to realize that the hotel standards are not the same all over the world which is why many hotels in morocco are rated 5 stars when its not even close. Just because some smiles at you and greets you all the time does not make a hotel 5 star!    Radisson Blu is designed very beautifully but not practical at all. The rooms have an open plan bathroom and room. Between the sink and bedroom is a cutout screen so water splashes over onto the carpet. Shower glass doors do not close 100% so the room gets flooded unless u shower in a small tiny conner. The toilets are in a smaaaaal tiny room with no ventilation whats so ever so the entire hotel smells of stale toilet air... disgusting!    Another thing that bothered me alittle was that there was a sign that said no smoking and if you do smoke you will be charged a fee for the deep clean. I understand that you would be charged for breaking the rules - duh! But what i dont get is the deep clean only after smoking...Does that mean that they do not do a deep clean after each guest leaves? I felt really disgusted as tho i was surrounded by bacteria galore. I could not wait to get out of there and scrub myself clean.    The hotel is located in a great area right next to a mall so no problem with food options and you can walk around in that area to explore. I love that about this hotel.    There is no proper parking outside the hotel so when we were getting dropped off we were having alot of problems. Dont understand why the hotel  being 5 stars mind you did not take care of this. We went on a tour and when we got back  the police did not want us to jump off as the tour guide had to double park because there was no parking. Hotel staff or concierge were no where to be found and when they finally did appear  they were of no help.    Breakfast is average as well. Had your basics such as eggs and sausages and thats kinda the main things. The chef making the eggs is extremely rude and arrogant so go with a calm mind as he really does not listen to you and what you want. He tells you what you should put in your omelet and you cannot tell him otherwise because he then gets angry and starts cooking furiously. Bits of egg flew right at us (EW!) all because we did not want chilli powder but some of the chilli paste.    So overall this hotel is great if you plan on staying for just 1 night. Any longer and its not comfortable at all,Date of stay: December 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Durban, South Africa",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zaakira123

"Radisson Blu Hotel, Marrakech Carre Eden",FISboy wrote a review Jan 2017,40,Nice modern hotel,After staying in ryads for the first part of our trip we stayed at Radisson Blu Hotel for 5 nights. It is a modern hotel that is located in a safe clean part of Marrakech. It was about a 25 minute was to Jemaa Fna square.    We booked a junior suite and this worked well for our family as there were two separate bathrooms. On some days the shower was not hot enough but it was mostly ok. Our balcony had a city view.    The hotel is next to Carre Eden mall and the food court there was useful as by this portion of the trip the kids were craving Western-style fast food after days of eating (tasty) Moroccan food.    The staff was very friendly and the concierge desk was top notch. Special thanks to Moaad who was extremely helpful with our requests!

Would certainly like to return to this hotel in a great central location. A short taxi ride to the Medina and some lovely international restaurants within walking distance of hotel.

"Radisson Blu Hotel, Marrakech Carre Eden",Brian E wrote a review Dec 2016,30,"Nice rooms, friendly staff.....but some annoying issues. Next time, I'll stay in a nice, similarly priced riad","My wife and I liked the rooms of this new hotel. However there were some issues that should have been ironed out months ago. We had breakfast at the restaurant three times. It was a bit different each time. First day the food and service were both good. Second day the ""hot food"" was cold (the potatoes sausages etc). Also there was no staff to operate the espresso machines which was quite the problem when there is a line of 15 guests speaking different languages and none having experience operating an espresso machine. The third day my wife's omelette was waaaay undercooked. We don't mind fresh eggs that are a bit ""wet."" But these were egg whites that weren't whisked properly and then weren't cooked thoroughly.    This hotel was in the heart of the ""new area."" It was less than 10min via taxi to the medina prices ranging from 30-70 dhm ($3-7) and were never hard to find. I inquired about arranging a private taxi to Fez however the hotel front desk quoted about $200 more than our Fez riad offered to set it up for. I understand a small difference..but the hotel was clearly trying to make a good chunk of change on it (~$450 vs $260).    The pool looked really cool but we didn't get a chance to use it.    Would I stay here again? I doubt it. I'd probably just look for a nice riad in the same price range.",Date of stay: November 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Miami, Florida",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/briane400

Comparing to other hotels in the city the property is great with friendly staff new rooms tasty food ( you should try Tangia ). You will have a good breakfast with different type of food. However every day is the same buffet item lineup. It would be good to change a little bit the breakfast buffet menu from time to time as long stayer guests will get bored at the end.    Overall experience was good specially that the property has fantastic location in the center of the city plus the mall Carre Eden and near famous brands shops.    One thing is to enhance the TV channel lineup. I was in a business trip and did not have alot of time to visit outside touristic places in Marrakech. My only entertainment was the TV.

"Radisson Blu Hotel, Marrakech Carre Eden",Willetts World wrote a review Oct 2016,50,"Well designed, well appointed, well managed and VERY well done",Stayed October 27-30 3 nights    The Good:  Where do I begin. Everything about this hotel will only enhance your Marrakech experience not to mention how well it represents the Radisson Blu brand. It must be up there with the best. The great thing about it is it is in the beautiful Red City of Marrakech. If you haven't been and are thinking about it it is chalk and cheese between Marrakech and the likes of Casablanca or Rabat.    Location: It doesn't get any closer to the city centre. It is the city centre. On the main street of town. There are malls and shops galore all within walking distance including a giant Carrefour downstairs for those essentials you might need. Plus loads of local restaurants. And the whole area is suited for outdoor dining. It's a short walking distance to everything and only an inexpensive taxi ride to the Medina.    Was met with such warmth and enthusiasm. The team made us feel very welcome and could not be more helpful. We were taken to the room by a very friendly girl who offered us any assistance we may need during the 3 days stay.    The room design is brilliant. Clearly whoever the designer was has stayed in many hotels and understands the little idiosyncrasies that guests enjoy and need. The hotel is a very modern design but with a distinctively Moroccan ambience. The rooms are spacious loads of natural light with ample working space. The bed faces the outdoor sliding doors which opens onto a large balcony so there is loads and loads of natural light. In the morning was able to slide the curtains across to have a brilliant Moroccan sunrise.    The room is very tastefully decorated and furnished in a modern Moroccan style. Soft muted colours with coloured chairs and lamps to offset it. Really tasteful. And simple. Not over the top.    There is a mini-bar fridge that is actually cold inside! ( Another pet-peeve of mine fridges in hotels that aren't cold! drives me crazy ! ha ha ) It is stocked with the usual drinks and candy but if you are like us and have a golden rule of not using mini-bars ( ever ) we simply emptied it out and loaded it up with fresh fruit and food we bought from Carrefour downstairs.    Wifi was a bit sketchy. Mostly reasonable speed except mid-evening and early-morning when there is obviously a lot of use.    You have a choice of instant coffee and tea or they have a coffee machine as well. And of course there is a safe for your valuables.    A key thing is the great amount of cupboard space and drawers in the room. How many times do you get to a hotel room and there is no where to put your stuff? Not here more than enough space.    The bathroom: Wow. Large. Natural light beaming in from the frosted glass at one end of the bathroom with natural light directly from outside. You can even open the window if you want ( except the neighbours would have a show ).    There is a rain-shower or normal hand held shower if you want. You can walk through the shower from one end to the other. It's open-ended either end. It's a really clever design.    Water pressure is medium. The floor is non - slip amazing ( why aren't all hotels doing this! ). The toilet is separated from the bathroom. There is a double sink with full size mirrors above it as well as a full length mirror on the door. Best of all large thick white towels.    Balcony: We had a business room and it had a large balcony. It was so nice to have an outdoor area. There were some chairs and a small table outside. We were on the east side of the building and got the morning sun. So nice. And of course a few pre-dinner drinks on the balcony as well.    We never tried the facilities in the hotel but the bar looked quite funky. The restaurant is quite a good size but cannot comment on the breakfast as used the balcony. I checked the gym out and it was a good size with state of the art equipment. The pool was closed during this stay but they offered an alternative pool at a sister hotel if required.    One one night room service was ordered. Stunning. From the time it didn't take ( it was delivered to the room within 20 minutes of placing the order ) the presentation of the food the quality was superb. Better than most 5 star restaurants and best of all very reasonably priced. Order the spaghetti folks. Incredible.    The not so good:  If there is one criticism it would have to be the bed. The bed linens were cotton and had a great doona but it was hard and uneven. Like most European hotels ( and I guess African as well ) it was 2 single beds joined together and covered over with a king bed protector. Everything else was king size except for the 2 beds which were uneven in the middle.    But as I write this I think to myself What a whiner.... complaining because the beds weren't even... how precious am I becoming!! Sometimes we have to keep things in perspective don't we.    Summary:  This hotel is incredible and was a joy to stay. It is ideally located centrally located a great team of people and nice contemporary rooms. It made Marrakech just that extra special because of the quality of this place. It was a flashback to the good old days when hotels treated guests as guests rather than commodities. And when hotel staff enjoyed themselves and made it about the guest rather than themselves. And it is obviously very well managed.    Would I stay again: I'll give you one guess.....  Would I recommend: I'll give you another guess..... of course,Date of stay: October 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Sydney, Australia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robdubluu

The rooms are beautifully decorated and spacious. The pool is heated and exceptionally beautiful you never want to leave! The gym is fully equipped and practical. Great location with tones of great restaurants and stores in the neighborhood you can easily walk to. Stop by the hotel store if you have time they have really nice designer souvenirs to take home.

"Radisson Blu Hotel, Marrakech Carre Eden",Tony F wrote a review Oct 2016,50,Amazing modern hotel,Amazing modern hotel right in the centre and a short taxi ride to the main square market and Souks which costs less than ¬£2 and a short ride from the airport. Situated right next to a shopping mall with a huge Carrefour supermarket on the lower floor. Next door to Starbucks and a row of trendy cheap restaurants and coffee shops. The hotel staff are fantastic especially Sihom who checked us in and out and was friendly funny and efficient. Lobby was lovely pool and pool area were beautiful and was quiet with most of the beds available throughout the day. Gym was huge and breakfast buffet was amazing with omelettes cooked to order and all the hot and cold food you could need. The room on the 4th floor had a balcony overlooking the pool. The pillow cases were luxurious and beds comfortable and bathroom was large with a walk-in rain shower. The flat screen TV had a 24 movie channel which was great. Free WiFi all over even around the pool which was great to have.

The major enquiry on booking was that a fast and stable internet connection was a must. The hotel is a modern affair with decent facilities. What it does not have is what I needed - high speed internet. I was sent a technician who did not know how to resolve the problem on the first night - 1mbps for this type of hotel and cost is frankly not acceptable. The A/C did not function - promised support for that issue still had not arrived the following morning. The beds are very very hard.

From the security at the door and going up to the 2nd floor where front desk restaurants pool and bar located everyone's seems and looks professional  friendly.    I was seated and listened to Rachida from front desk who made my day. True experienced professional with excellent customer service and handling. She talked me through the hotel group then offered me a tour to see hotel rooms ( without been pushy) the approach was welcoming friendly that I was happy to take the tour and listen to everything she had to say. We met Ilham from the SPA who equally was professional. Finally I decided to set in the pool area and have a coffee. I was served by Zakia who came across professional  friendly attentive.

The whole stay was perfect from the minute we were picked up from the airport by our driver to the minute he dropped us back a week later.    The rooms are absolutely gorgeous. They are very spacious and well decorated: the decor is really modern with a hint of Moroccan design which is really classy!    All facilities are super clean and well kept.    A big plus is that they have a very well equipped gym with a very good PT to train/assist you.    The swimming pool and the gardens are really nice and quiet which is all I needed on my break - tranquility and relax!  Staff are very attentive and they will offer preparing whichever sunbed you want to chill in with a towel and a parasol. Food and beverage is also available to order all around the pool and gardens.    Now... Moving on to the best bit of the stay!! LILA Gueliz: the restaurant!  The buffet breakfast we had included in our stay was awesome! Lots of options to choose from which is thumbs up for those who have dietary requirements etc. You can also order omelettes of your choice which are prepared there and then by the friendly chefs!    We had lunch dinner and brunches at LILA Gueliz restaurant pretty much every day of our stay because we simply couldn't get enough! The food was beautifully presented which is what attracts me most to my meal. Taste was beyond amazing. I'd give the chefs a 100 out of 10 any day!! Definitely a must try.    Entertainment is really nice in the evenings: Live DJs and music!    I had a 45minute relaxing massage treatment at EdenSpa and it was just what I needed. The facilities were really nice and the therapist was really good! All staff at EdenSpa are very friendly and professional. Another big thumbs up!üëçüèº    For those who love flowers like I do Radisson Blu Hotel has an in-house floral designer and boutique called YASSAB. Their creations are beautiful and I couldn't get enough of them! The whole hotel is decorated by their flowers and that's another reason why I fell in love with this place!    The Hotel is in Gueliz which is approximately 10 minutes from Jamaa Lfna Square. Carre Eden Shopping Centre is just literally beneath/behind the hotel which is really handy.    The staff know the area very well and are happy to give directions or arrange travel for you.    Finally last but not least all staff at the hotel were extremely pleasant friendly and professional.

"Radisson Blu Hotel, Marrakech Carre Eden",iTravellin wrote a review May 2016,50,"If you love your fitness, come to this hotel",Why? Because Ali the PT of the gym is very very helpful! He is not the kind of PT who just hang around showing you what's what. He actually train you!  I was worried about not having enough exercise (in definition of doing Bootcamp) while I'm in Marrakech and he tailored a crossfit exercise for me everyday.  I really appreciate his proactiveness and friendliness. He still of course welcome people to the gym when they enter and ask if he can help (so despite my session is always interrupted) I appreciate that he does such things for clients.    I personally think he is the best asset of the hotel. So as I said if you love your fitness come to Radisson Blu Marrakech!    There are a lot of other good aspects of the hotel of course. But Ali is outstanding. The gym itself is one of the biggest I've ever been. It definitely helps with having such an excellent session.    Thank you Ali! I'll definitely come back and it's because of your fitness help! Keep up the good work that you do!,Date of stay: May 2016,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iTravellin
