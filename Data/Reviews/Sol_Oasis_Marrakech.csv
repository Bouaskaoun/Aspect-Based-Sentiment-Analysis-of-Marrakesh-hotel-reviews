Sol Oasis Marrakech,Christof lemon pie wrote a review Today,10,Blackpool in the sun.,Just bombarded with rubbish techno all day. Am by the pool now and can’t even listen to my own music on my noise cancelling AirPod pros. Spoken to animation team they just don’t get the fact there us 3 people doing salsa yet the whole of the pool area has to endure full volume salsa along with pre-recorded fairground style announcements. Average age is probably 40 yet we seem to be in a cheap rate Blackpool/Ibiza pool party.    Reception aren’t bothered either so I though I’d write a review. Aqua aerobics next - can’t wait. x,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Hove, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Christoflemonpie
Sol Oasis Marrakech,stevemcwarburton wrote a review Dec 2022,50,Sol Oasis paradise!,Well we have just had a most wonderful 2 weeks at the Sol Oasis. The reviews we read were unanimously positive and we must agree. Being our first foreign holiday since Covid we only got our passports renewed this July we were rather apprehensive of even travelling anywhere let alone flying again to North Africa. But everything went well.  The hotel was refurbished last year and I can honestly say that we had no issues at all with anything at the hotel. The room was excellent everything functioned perfectly including the lighting door entry bathroom and shower fridge and an ace foolproof safe. The cleaner was lovely almost every day you could set your clock by the regularity of her visits plus her cheery smile. Reception staff often a letdown were efficient and pleasant and so helpful. Animation staff as unanimously praised by all reviewers were excellent and not pushy at all. Sam the main man is virtually a mouth on legs! But in a pleasant way. Top marks to Russ and his new wife Susu - what a lovely couple. Had at least 3 meals with Russ and discussed everything under the sun. They got married on November 5th so we taught him the rhyme 'Remember Remember the 5th of November' so he will hopefully not forget their first anniversary. Serving staff in the dining area were all lovely but special praise for Hicham who even made proper English tea in a teapot for us along with some lovely strong but milky coffees. Nothing was too mush trouble for him. Naoual Ilham Zakaria Jallal and Miriam were lovely. Special mention for Mohamed one of the evening waiters!  Food was superb even after 2 weeks we were still being surprised and amazed by the quality and variety. Every meal included 5 or 6 tagines and other Moroccan dishes beef and chicken and turkey were beautiful we even had minute steaks one night. Fish and crevettes were super. There is provision for pizza lovers and lasagna plus chilli con carne etc but virtually the only Western food we ate was a few chips here and there! Desserts were very varied but the Moroccan night biscuits and meringues were amazing.  One of the downfalls of most all-inclusive breaks is the wine often cheap tacky stuff from huge casks. But the wine at Sol Oasisi was of very high quaility - bottled in Spain you can even buy it on the internet! White wine was comparable to what we use at home and how many times are you offered sparkling wine? Beer was imported bottled in Portugal. We enjoyed it.  The grounds are beautiful well tended and we watched with interest as 5 olive trees were brought in on a wagon and planted by the Spa. Gardeners working every day.  Hicham the Tour Guide was most helpful certainly not pushy and helped us to confirm our return transfer via Whatsapp. This being our 3rd visit to Marrakech we weren't really interested in tours but we went on the freebie half day trip to Marrakech and used the hotel shuttle vehicle to enjoy a private potter round parts of the Medina. The shuttles ran roughly every 1.5 hours bookable in advance. Fascinating to see parts of the city on your way to and from the Medina.  We both sadly went down with a cold plus sore throat several days after we arrived but managed to get some appropriate medication at a Pharmacy just about a mile away - the walk there and back was interesting and some of my highlight photos were taken in the housing development surrounding the Pharmacy.  As with most hotels in Marrakech the hotel is roughly a 25 minute drive from the city and is located in virtually a wilderness but we enjoyed meeting up with local goat and sheep herders but what they find to eat was baffling!  In conclusion I would just like to add that this being our first trip after Covid I was so pleased we went for 2 weeks rather than our customary 10 or 11 nights. And would we go back? Certainly would probably the best and most restful holiday we have ever had.,Date of stay: November 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,English in Scotland,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevemcwarburton
Sol Oasis Marrakech,Anne0944 wrote a review Today,40,Good and not so good,This is a really lovely resort very clean nice rooms gorgeous pool.  What lets it down is the food.

Sol Oasis Marrakech,Janel S wrote a review Today,50,Nice and relaxing stay at sop oasis,The hotel was very nice there was great choice of food in restaurant many activities during the day. If you have kids (up to 10 years) the Sol Oasis is a perfect hotel for you. The kids club is so valuable service that is offered and the ladies Wahiba and Zuzu working at the club super friendly and loved by the kids. They also involved perfectly kids who don’t speak English nor French everything run smoothly kids had different activities starting from archery and football to painting mini disco and kids yoga.

We stayed in a family room which was very spacious. Unlimited food drinks and cocktails available pretty much the entire day.

Sol Oasis Marrakech,J B wrote a review Yesterday,50,Fantastic 4 night get away,Absolutely fantastic hotel! Even better in real life than in the photos. Staff friendly and helpful. Very clean and modern hotel yet with an authentic feel. Room was lovely and food was great. Used the spa for a hammam and massage. Pool area clean and spacious plenty of sun beds and no need to get up early to save the best spot. Went on a trip booked through the hotel to Marrakech city with a tour guide which was well worth it as otherwise we’d have got lost as the souk is a maze!

Sol Oasis Marrakech,richard_watters wrote a review Mar 23,10,OK hotel - shame about the food!,"Food was absolutely awful. Rarely hot always bland All meat etc pre-cooked then re-heated. The ""burger bar"" which we assumed would serve hot freshly cooked burgers had a pile of cold pre cooked burgers which the server put in a bun with a bit of salad then under the grill for a minute. So the bun was hot but the burger was still cold. This epitomised the whole attitude to their food offering.  We switched two nights to the paid for restaurants but the food was awful there too so we ended up taking taxis to Marrakesh to eat in the evening.  Hotel facilities generally good although we had to move rooms a couple of hours after checking in due to the smell of sewage.  Not what you'd expect from Melia group always found their hotels good in the past.",Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"York, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/richard_watters
Sol Oasis Marrakech,moooooeee wrote a review Mar 21,10,Can not reach the booking desk/strict cancellation policy,I am supposed to stay in the Hotel on April 1st and April 2nd. This is my first time going to Morocco and because of my mistake I booked this hotel which is in a different City than the City I'll be staying in (3 hours away).    I realized my mistake within 24 hours of booking. Called up the Hotel nonstop for 3-4 days but could not never reach the Booking desk. The only real person I was able to speak is during the night time and he would advise calling during the daytime. So I kept calling (from the USA) but it was always busy.    Finally I raised a request with Expedia (I had booked through them). They tried contacting the Hotel couldn't reach them and gave up after a couple of days.    I have now gone ahead and filed a chargeback with my credit card. I hope the Hotel sees this feedback and makes it right.    I hope my first trip to Morocco is better than this.,Date of stay: March 2023,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/moooooeee

Sol Oasis Marrakech,Tina T wrote a review Mar 20,50,Fabulous. Cannot wait to return.,Fabulous grounds lovely room distant views of the snow topped Atlas Mountains heated pool friendly and very helpful staff great food and plentiful drinks. No problem getting a pool side sunbed (no need to ‘reserve’)  30 mins outside Marrakech making it peaceful away from the bustling city.  Warmly greeted on arrival but same as others we learnt about the towels and restaurants from other guests over a few beers. No biggie a FAQ sheet on arrival would help. This does no way detract from how lovely this place is.  We’re looking at going back the same time next year.,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Reading, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tinat610
Sol Oasis Marrakech,HonestDanny wrote a review Mar 19,50,Amazing place just needs minor improvements but would return and also recommend the positives out weigh the negatives,"So to start off I really wanted to give sol oasis a 4 star however I feel this could impact the resort so I'll start with the negatives and put the positives.    ***NEGATIVES***    So to start we arrived about 10pm and was greeted by reception. I was given a key and explained what was written on the paper surrounding my card about times of restaurant and that we could book the separate restaurant 1 time during our stay (which was fully booked all week) and that was all that was explained. Someone had shown us to the room and explained everything inside and was very nice. On the days that followed nothing else was explained we had to find out from other people staying in the resort. Apparently there was a welcome meeting which we didn't know about? and some other said the same but others were told about this. Things we didn't know about There is a big white board with a schedule for each day pool towels 100 mad each as a deposit and you get the money back free shuttle bus tour guides spa service and late check out charge just some of the things. Upon checking out there was a young girl who didn't look interested and kept saying to wait on the manager which we did. The food was ok sometimes really good and sometimes it was adequate the drinks are included but some of the cocktails just weren't what they were supposed to be.    ***POSITIVES***    HOWEVER out with the negatives which could be easily sorted out and start with some positives. The staff are second to none of amazing!! They love working there and always smiling making an effort with you ""SAM"" was fantastic just an entertainer just lights up your day and night such a natural thing to him especially his ""story's"" made me laugh. ""FATI"" was just down to earth always great to have a chat and play games with whenever you needed something she was always there to help with or make your day easier. ""Niako"" was a great entertainer and fantastic dancer forever smiling I had the pleasure of having lunch with him and just makes you happy!. Unfortunately I can't remember a few others names and most of the guys outside were all great even the guys wearing the ""FRAM"" clothes. The bartender's are super nice always happy and would fist bump shake hands make a joke or ask how your day is going they were super nice. The restaurant staff were so good at the job there was no dishes or glasses left about and did the job with ease although they never spoke it was great. All the games were really good from volleyball to water polo archery darts football. The entertainment was great at night time and always something different each day. The pool was always clean and also the same with the loungers. The room was nice the AC was great and worked very well. Beds were changed everyday new towels also plus the shower is nice as well.  ***Conclusion***  As a whole the staff outside make this place what it is and I would recommend this place to anyone and will definitely return here. 99% of guests here were also really nice. So as a 4* resort I would say they could make this a 5* with the small changes well done sol oasis and the team 💚",Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Kilmarnock, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/foodgod88
Sol Oasis Marrakech,therobertsons1001 wrote a review Mar 19,40,Lovely break in Morocco,This hotel is really lovely and the food is fabulous. Rooms modern and spacious. Very little entertainment when we were there but that was early February but that wasn’t an issue for us. Cold in the mornings but in the 20’s by afternoon and always plenty of available sun beds at the pool . Always had singers in the evenings and as it was chilli the fire pits were lovely to sit beside. Definitely would recommend staffhotel food and trips all amazing A free shuttle takes you into Marrakech but on your first visit best to go with a guide the atlas mountain trip was a really enjoyable day out and would recommend,Date of stay: February 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Aberdeen, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/therobertsons1001

Sol Oasis Marrakech,David W wrote a review Mar 17,30,"Some parts Amazing, but we ended up quite ill",There is a lot to like about this Hotel but there are some significant improvements needed in a small number of areas that have impacted my review.    The Good.    The Staff - 5 out of 5. I would score higher if possible all the staff we encountered were absolutely sensational. Couldn't have done more for us. The entertainment team one of the best ever Fatima Mike Fazza Wahiba - wow they were absolutely amazing. Some of the best ever. I literally loved their company they make you feel like friends it's a real skill to do this and they deserve massive praise.    Hicham and the other bar staff absolutely incredible. Work so hard remembered my order again absolutely amazing.    The Shows 5 out of 5    Again loved them some of the best we have seen. The light show was innovative and massively entertaining.    The room 4.5 out of 5    Room was lovely had everything we needed great air con. We had to navigate 20 - 30 steps up and down as we were at the back of the complex. Would have also been nice if water was topped up.    Drinks 4 out of 5    Good quality drinks even though not branded. Wine and lager both good. Marked down as its 30 euros for two vodkas and coke after 11pm which is ridiculous. Also the water service is so daft! There is a fridge next to the bar but this spends much of the day empty so if you want a bottle of water you queue with people ordering several cocktails just for one bottle of water. Just a real shame creates more pressure for the bar staff and frustration for customers.    Food 1 put of 5    Not good at all sorry but so poor. Both me and my wife got food poisoning I couldn't leave my room for the last day and my wife is now vomitting 48 hours after we left. We didn't eat or drink outside of the hotel. Understandable this ruined our experience. Whilst we hadn't massively enjoyed the food prior we got by because of how good everything else was but to then become severely ill it wasn't acceptable. Photo below of chicken that was barbecued fresh but is visibly pink thankfully it was cold to touch and I noticed with this piece but has eaten other pieces. The deserts in all fairness were tasty but everything else below average and a disappointment. Example pizzas made outside stone baked oven but the dough wasn't cooked enough. Some exceptions Burgers at dinner excellent and odd find like veg soup.    Also tongs used to serve food with sauce so you couldn't get the sauce. Several items labelled wrong and the ice cream scoop was often going back into filthy water.    Just such a shame that this wasn't better not sure if there had been a change but several other guests said this was the only part of their experience they didn't enjoy.    Grounds and setting 4 out of 5.    The Hotel is really nice kept really clean and has everything you could want. It is very far out compared to others and that's the only reason for scoring it down.    Overall    It's such a shame we ended up ill and more a shame that we didn't spot the signs earlier. A few cups had been dirty and the undercooked chicken we should have been even more vigilant.,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Tyldesley, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidwV9033RH

All staff from the gardeners to the cleaners to the waiting staff and the bartender's were all approachable and friendly.  What did stand out was the amazing entertainment team who tirelessly organise activities throughout the day e.g. dancing lessons fun darts tournaments archery aqua aerobics and water polo to name a few.  However the evening shows that are held in the auditorium are first class!!  Hard to name a favourite Bollywood night being one of them.  Sam Niako (pineapple!!) Mike (Michael Jackson!!) Beautiful Fatima Fazz from Cazz Sousou and her brilliant husband the champion breakdancer all performed their hearts out after all day of helping the guests happy. Their passion is infectious. Their humour and sense of fun is just adorable. We wanted to adopt them all and show them to all our friends and family. Thanks to all for making it the best holiday we've had.

The serving staff including Hassan Nawal Assia and All are great fun attending to your every need keeping glasses topped up and supplying your favourite drinks without being prompted. The entertainment staff including Fati Sam Ross Mike Nico and all the rest of the entertainment team made our stay very special as they were so friendly and brilliant in everything that they did. The evening entertainment is outstanding and the food is extensive and very tasty. The layout of the hotel makes you feel that you are very much in Marrakesh yet is clean and new. The bar staff are also friendly and professional and a delight to meet as they remember all about you and your wants.

Sol Oasis Marrakech,Kevin H wrote a review Mar 14,20,Strong smell of Sewage in our room,When we arrived we thought this seemed like a lovely country and hotel. The people were friendly and the staff at the Hotel seemed great and for the first time my was thinking this is a Hotel where she would come back to.  What changed are mind was the room it smelled strongly of sewage!! We stayed for a long weekend for our wedding anniversary and one our first day the room didn’t smell to bad but the next day and the following day it smelled terrible. We asked to move rooms but were told there were no rooms available. The reception sent a technician to try to sort it and he did something in the shower and said it was done but it still smelled terrible so then they sent a cleaner who sprayed air freshener. This made it smell bearable but the next day it was back my wife rang the receptionist 3 times to get the someone to spray the room with air freshener again and they kept saying they were on their way . They eventually turned up 30 minutes later and we asked if the could leave the air fresher spray which they did we later found out that a couple of ladies we were speaking to had the same issue and asked to move and got moved to a another room the big issue I have is the 2 women asked to be moved a day after we asked to move!!! It’s a shame because this was our wedding anniversary and the first time we’d been away without the children in 10 years if the Hotel didn’t have any spare rooms they would of appeased us with some sort of compensation which would of made a difference and I would of been giving this hotel a 5 star review because everything else we were happy with. This is very disappointing because as I’ve said my wife doesn’t go back to the same place twice but she said if it wasn’t for the terrible smell of sewage in our room she would of come back. room number 1506,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kevinhB460RF

Sol Oasis Marrakech,Ramesh Kumar wrote a review Mar 6,50,"Amazing food, hospitality and entertainment",We booked for 2 nights for 2 families but could only stay 1 night as we were stuck en route with flood and snow  Promptly checked in very courteous and professional reception staff especially Mohamed great resort grounds and staff who work very hard to look after guests and are attentive and polite.  Excellent poolside bar and snack service very relaxing and enjoyable  The entertainment team is amazing and does a great job  The restaurant staff are great and very visible and attentive superb selection of local and international dishes which were very tasty and full of flavours  We requested late checkout and they helped with it. Didn't use the shuttle as we had our own vehicle. It is a bit far from the medina and centre but it is a calm and relaxing resort. Everyone was amazing and helpful.

Sol Oasis Marrakech,JayModh wrote a review Mar 5,50,Very good resort and Best Entertainment team,LOCATION: In a nice peaceful area just 20 mins away from Marrakech by hotel's free shuttle bus. Accomodation: Comfortable rooms spread out on a large grounds. Not enough hangers and clothes hanging space. We needed kettle in the room and they were more than happy to supply one. Cleaners would clean room everyday. Service: Everybody was very happy to provide good service please guests. FOOD: There was enough variety everyday. Food was very tasty and had few different dishes everyday. Morrocan italian Med Asian etc was all good and tasty. Although food was cooked freshly everyday only criticism is that occasionally some of the dishes were luke warm or room temperature when they should have been piping hot. I did point out and they did heat my plate but again same almost everyday. Breakfast was good everyday. Morrocan theme night food was the best. At busy times you have to wait in the queue to get a bottle of water which can be annoying. They might be keeping water behind the bar to stop wastage of bottled water? FACILITIES: Clean swimming pool well equiped indoor and outdoor Gym lots of playgrounds where lots of games were organised by the Entertainment teams. Very nice play areas and pool for very young guests.  NOW THE BEST PART of this resort: ENTERTAINMENT TEAM. One of the best entertainment team we have come accross is at Sol Oasis in Marrakech. The whole team is just Super Talented. Dancing Singing Sports Creativity and most important connecting with guests are some of the skills they have. They start activities and entertainment from morning till about 11.00 at night. They have live singing and dancing every evening and live performances 3-4 time a week in the theater and outdoors. They also bring artists from outside aswell. They just work tirelessly throughout the day around the swimming pool on the terrace in play grounds theatre hall kitchen-cooking classes Guests will lot of activities to choose from throughout the day. It will be unfair to name only few entertainmenbt team members. Every single team member was great. Guests will never feel left out. They go around and ask everybody how they are doing if guest wants to take part in an activity and always make them feel at ease. They show genuine interest in staying in touch with guests. I think they have a great leader in Entertainment Teams. This Entertainment/Animation team makes up more than half of the fun staying at this resort.,Date of stay: February 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Milton Keynes, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JayModh
Sol Oasis Marrakech,Simon S wrote a review Mar 5,40,Very enjoyable stay,Had a lovely stay here. Was a little wait at reception to check in (wasn’t offered a welcome drink as others seemed to have had)  The weather was a little bit of a let down. Cold in mornings and evenings but when the sun came out it was beautiful (not the hotels fault of course !?)  Room was comfortable. Everything worked well. Sometimes house keeping missed our room to clean (maybe due to us being late risers?) Our Shower leaked a little bit onto the bathroom floor but this wasn’t an inconvenience. Asked for a kettle to be delivered to the room and this was handled well.  Animation team were great!! They really worked hard and tried their best to keep guests entertained (fatti Sam Mike & archery man (forget his name but sounds like he’s from Manchester lol). Shows in the evening by the team.  Plenty of food to choose from. Themed buffet every night. It did seem to get a bit repetitive (especially desserts) but there was a lot to choose from.  Pool bar staff were very efficient and hard working. Get to know them and occasionally tip and you’ll get fantastic service (they even remember your order). Queues to get drinks at busy times so perhaps they could put on some extra bar staff during peak times ??  Pool was huge and heated which was a nice touch.  Lovely open fire pits for the cold nights. A really nice touch but did get to the room at the end of the night smelling like a bonfire!?    Would definitely go back again.    One negative which is out of the hotels control…  Many many local families and kids showed little respect whilst queuing for food or drinks. They would simply push in. Kids ran riot. Their parents let them do whatever they wanted running around screaming and shouting. Very little control whatsoever. Very hazardous in the restaurant with plates and hot food around. Many kids used to pile their plates up with food just for the sake of it which was very wasteful and sad to see :(,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/508SimonS

From the minute I walked in I was treated with such great hospitality I was given a welcome drink and given a great overview of the hotel by the guest experience team. There is a shuttle that takes you into town and picks you up they can organise excursions for you. Late checkout can be arranged. The rooms are wonderfully decorated and the beds are very comfortable. The buffet has a great selection and very tasty the cocktails are really good too!

Sol Oasis Marrakech,Mark N wrote a review Mar 1,40,60th Birthday holiday,This was our first trip to Marrakesh.    We took a chance with the Sol Oasis and found it be a nicely appointed hotel. It was clean and contrary to a number of other reviews we found the food to be varied plentiful and hot.    We had a standard room that was air conditioned clean and spacious but unfortunately had no balcony.    In fact we found the whole site to be spacious with plenty of room to host numerous sports and activities. The swimming pool was the cleanest that we’ve seen in a hotel probably because it is covered overnight.    But the real stars of the hotel were the staff. All of the animation team were friendly but not too pushy to get guests participating in activities. In particular Sam was a great master ceremonies during the week we were there.    The outside bar staff (especially Norbedine and Higham) were also friendly (apart from one occasion when another member of staff pulled the shutter down at 11pm in quite an aggressive fashion - I’ve never seen that happen at a holiday resort before) with a smile all day long (especially to those with manners…). Inside the star of the show was the lovely Hanane who ensured that my 60th birthday was suitably celebrated.    Finally a few words of caution (not complaints) for first-time visitors to Sol Oasis:    - The hotel is a good 20 minutes outside of the city. If you want a resort hotel then the Sol Oasis is perfect. But if you are making numerous trips into the city yes the free shuttle is great but you are probably better off finding somewhere in Marrakesh itself.  - Contrary to hotel advertising there is really only one main restaurant (Darna) for all your meals. That wasn’t a problem for us but some might want more variety. You can only book the Moroccan restaurant (Cafe Maure) once (as it’s included in the all-inclusive package) and the Spanish restaurant (Safran - that isn’t included) was empty virtually every night.  - The language of the hotel is predominantly French. Virtually all of the staff speak very good English and all animation announcements are in both languages. But you are likely to be frustrated at times especially when there is precious little paperwork to inform you about anything.    Overall a very pleasant stay primarily down to the hardworking staff.,Date of stay: February 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Billericay, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/160markn

Sol Oasis Marrakech,Banksy594 wrote a review Feb 2023,10,BE AWARE YOUR PERSONAL SAFETY MAYBE COMPROMISED IF YOU STAY HERE,Please be aware: Your personnal safety maybe compromised if you stay here!    I would never have thought that I would ever have to review a hotel on our travels to warn fellow travellers. I want future possible  guests to be made aware of what happened to us. Something similar or worse could occur during your stay to you or your loved ones. I would be full of extreme regret if I did not post this warning……    This all started a week into our holiday. There was what appeared to be a party in the room above us. We endured it until the early hours of the morning. Eventually we telephoned reception and someone went to their room to stop the noise. They did but as soon as the person left the music restarted and the party continued. Much later we went to reception to kindly ask them again to ask the the guests to go to bed so fellow guests could at least get some sleep. They said they would ask security to go to the room. We eventually managed to get some sleep.    The following day we asked for a meeting with Rachida Arifi from guest relations. She said that she would speak to them and Ms Arifi came back to us asking if we wanted to meet the party lads so they could apologise in person. I refused as I didn’t want them to know who we were as we had complained. We were told that there is a hotel policy that all noise should stop at midnight. However there aren’t any signs displayed anywhere or paperwork in the rooms informing guests to substantiate this claim!!!    The next evening we were in our room around 9 pm when the two men from the room above us tried to get into our room. We shouted at them through the door that the room is occupied and to leave us alone. This was intimidating and what would have happened if they had succeeded and gained entry? Assault harassment stabbing who knows? The one thing I can say it was not a mistake and they weren’t popping in to say hello. The hotel have said there’s not CCTV to prove this.    We immediately got dressed and rushed to reception. The manager was having a chat with one of the two men from the room above us. They both left and went into another room out of our view. The manager came back and my wife explained what had happened and informed him what had also happened the night before.  The manager said the two lads had just returned to the hotel by bus so it couldn’t have been them - Marrakesh is a 30 minute bus ride away.  Then he stated the two guests had now gone out and that they would be moved upon their return. However that could be 4-5 am. This didn’t make sense at all. We asked him to call the police and then the manager started to shout at us. We were taken aback as he yelled at us to call the police. He then offered us a guard outside our room for the night!! What a holiday! My wife went to look for another manager and found the head of entertainment. He was more professional and reassuring. I demanded that we change rooms immediately. Our safety had been compromised and we packed up all our things and porters helped us move. We were given the choice of two rooms one was identical to ours but had a musty smell and the other was an upgrade to a family room so we had to accept that.    The following day no one from Management came to see us and my heart had gone into irregular rhythm with all the stress. That evening the entertainment manager told us the hotel director would have a meeting with us the next day. We cancelled our day out and waited and waited but to no avail.    The next morning reception said Ms Arifi would be in 10.30-11 am and I asked for her to come and see us. The day passed and I had to go back to reception only to be told she would be in 7 pm and that’s when we finally had our meeting. She said we misunderstood there was never a meeting and the management just hid behind Ms Arifi.    A meal in the Moroccan restaurant is given to each hotel reservation so one visit as part of the holiday package. This restaurant shares the kitchen and the ONLY waiter with the Tapas restaurant next door with toilets in the middle! Bizarre but true….    We were given a second meal in this restaurant with a bottle of cheap sparkling wine due to the noise disruption!    Finally after cutting our holiday short due to everything we asked to join our friends back in the Moroccan restaurant as they had not yet had their inclusive meal there and we did.    The main breakfast lunch dinner restaurant and inside bar are not heated so this is how people dine to keep warm in bobble hats and coats etc.    Staff are very friendly and helpful especially Hicham and Nourideen from behind the bar Abdellih the waiter for Moroccan and Tapas restaurant. The entertainment crew with a special mention to Mike Fatima and Sam… this work is totally undone when guests don’t feel safe and management don’t apply duty of care.    Now Ms. Arifi will reply to this review and probably have a totally different take on our experience we hope we will not experience anything like it again and never have before. I have 125000 readers for my reviews and very well travelled fortunately around the world but we have never ever cut short our holiday as we did on this occasion.    but all this good work is totally undone if the guests do not feel safe and that the management do not apply the duty of care when those guests step over their threshold too have a holiday on Sol Oasis property .    The food is average at bestbreakfast is repetitive and no new items really feature daily.White Wine is palatable Spanish justbeer is from Sagres in Portugalevery time we do All Inclusive I wonder why so this has definitely got it out of our system unless it’s unavoidable….we asked for compensation and Mdme ARIFI informed me that they did not breach their contract…….obviously safety of guests doesn’t come under that contract….enough said    Now Mdm ARIFI will reply to this review and probably give a totally different take or view on our experiencebut we have been totally honest and non biased in our review here of our holiday experienceone we hope we not need to experience again.,Date of stay: February 2023,,"Gerrards Cross, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Banksy594
Sol Oasis Marrakech,Reading Royals2 wrote a review Feb 2023,30,Guests behaviour,To re-iterate a recent review comment one of the criticisms of the hotel itself is the lack of basic information on arrival.    The complimentary shuttle is great. However as mentioned the bus drop off point is a fair way from the Main Square/Medina and you are not shown where to go.    What actually lets the hotel down in our opinion is in general the calibre of clientele.  Yes it’s an All Inclusive Hotel However not all guests wish to spend their time drinking copious amounts of alcohol from the minute the bar opens until closing time. It was extremely frustrating when going to the bar just to get a bottle of water or a coffee to have to wait in a long queue to be served whilst people were ordering in excess of four to six drinks each at an average of hourly intervals throughout the day. Neither is is particularly pleasant having to watch paraletic/intoxicated 20/30 year olds falling all over the place screaming and yelling to each other from one end of the hotel grounds to the other.    With regard to the all inclusive buffet apart from the ‘rancid’ butter mentioned in a review which explains why our rolls tasted like vomit (!) you would think some of the guests had been starved and food was in short supply! Running into the buffet grabbing endless plates of food then leaving lots to waste. Coupled with the inability to use tongs touching coughing and sneezing over the food we were not surprised to have fallen ill with a virus during our .    Finally picking up on a recent review I had a couple of items of clothing go missing from my room which could well have been taken in error when the bed was changed. We reported this to Guest Services and I would have expected with an in-house laundry that the items were found and returned to me. This was sadly not the case and leaves a bad taste.    In summary if you love to spend every day and night drinking yourself under the table  have a penchant for gluttonous behaviour and dont really care where in the world you are the Sol Oasis is the perfect hotel for you!,Date of stay: February 2023,,"Berkshire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/readingroyal2

Sol Oasis Marrakech,Jordan S wrote a review Feb 2023,20,Lovely hotel but lots of room for improvement,"We wanted to have a half-term break with (hopefully some sun) that wasn't too far from the UK to travel with our 4 year old and 9 month year old. We also wanted somewhere all-inclusive but where we could have some adult time as well. Sol Oasis ticked all those boxes and the reviews were very positive. The reality however was somewhat disappointing.    First impressions count and on arrival there was no overview of the hotel or it's facilities no information shared about food times excursions layout drinks etc. We were also served welcome drinks (in the land of fresh oranges) which were more akin to Sunny Delight circa 1998. The hotel itself is beautiful the inside bar / lounge area is exactly as pictured.    We had requested a cot via email via the app (which they claimed didn't exist but actually had our booking and room number on it) via reception via call twice and in person. It eventually arrived 4 hours later. We had opted for the largest room and it was very spacious clean and tastefully decorated. It was cleaned impeccably every day.    There was a Nespresso machine but no pods. We requested these and someone arrived with some promptly as well as some drinks for the mini fridge and a selection of sweet treats. A nice touch or so we thought. They then returned 5 minutes later saying there was a mistake and swiftly took all of these out of the room. The coffee pods eventually arrived but when we requested more later in the week we were told these were now at an additional cost. So a coffee machine as standard in our room but the coffee was charged. This is a running theme across the hotel.    The hotel advertises 4 restaurants. Nowhere does it say that one of those is permanently closed the other is a paid for tapas restaurant which sits empty one is Moroccan and you can only go once (it's the same food as the buffet but in a restaurant setting) and then a themed restaurant. So ultimately it's one restaurant for the entire stay - breakfast lunch and dinner. The food was quantity over quality and none of it is hot. The potatoes are always undercooked and we experienced raw merguez sausages. It's all lukewarm (school dinners come to mind). The drinks are all sweetened the coffee is from a machine and all tastes like sweetened milk the wine was passable. The cocktails are woeful - they all taste of the same lemon washing-up liquid regardless of choice and served in dirty plastic cups. Any drink that might be served with some care is charged as extra.    The kids pool is never heated it's freezing and sat unused for the majority of our trip. The kids club and staff however are fantastic. It's open all day to drop in and out of and the staff work really hard to keep things fun.    There is a lot of ""forced fun"" as this hotel which some people might enjoy but we just wanted to relax and not take part in belly dancing or darts or the evening ""entertainment"".    We took the free shuttle bus into the center which is very useful but there's a pre-arranged scheme with the driver to drop you next to his friends a little out of the main area who are then all pushing and offering tours as soon as you step out of the bus.    We did raise our issues with management on day one as we do not like leaving reviews without the hotel having a chance to improve but unfortunately things remained consistently average.    Overall the kids had fun with the pool and made some friends but for us it was disappointing. The annoying thing is that this could be an incredible hotel and experience the children's setup and staff are amazing but it's let down by many details once you scratch away the nice aesthetic.",Date of stay: February 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Ipswich, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jordanwsadler
Sol Oasis Marrakech,Joanne J wrote a review Feb 2023,50,Nice relaxing holiday,The whole hotel was extremely clean the cleaners tend to come in to your rooms and clean everyday (unless you ask them not to which we did a couple of days). The restaurant had a massive range of food for breakfast lunch and dinner time and also outside offering snacks like pizzas burgers and pastries. There's also a wide option for drinks some you pay extra for like Bailey's. The entertainment is a little late if I'm honest it starts at 9.45pm so we only attended once whilst there. That night was actually one of the best it was valentine's day so they had couples playing games and it was so funny. The hotel offers a free bus to the souks (markets) and offer lots of excersions (but we didn't find this out until a few days in) camel rides quad biking hot air balloon rides etc all at extra cost. I had a 60 min massage in the spa it was lovely and cost 500 Dirham. For a couple's relaxing holiday this is definitely the place to be. I saw a kids clubs but didn't use it as I didn't go with kids there's a gym tennis volleyball and table tennis area again I didn't make use of it.  One thing I didn't much like but plenty of people did and will was the cats roaming the hotel. I suppose as I'm not a pet person I just didn't like that much. There was also a resident little bird in the restaurant.  Over all though it was a lovely place and I would recommend if you're hoping to visit.,Date of stay: February 2023,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K8452TJjoannej

Sol Oasis Marrakech,mike g wrote a review Feb 2023,20,Dreadful experience,I am writing to express our disgust with the Sol Oasis Melia Hotel. To such an extent we truncated our holiday and booked flights home.  We chose the hotel after considerable deliberation taking into account both the hotel information and the Trip Advisor reports .  The hotel information is erroneous and falls well short of being a 4 star hotel .  The primary complaint is that the food was appalling:- overcooked vegetables fish and meat tough chicken burgers etc  food was served tepid and the general quality poor .  Surviving on bread rolls and butter only to find the pre packed butter was rancid .We were informed this did sometimes happen  although I have never experienced rancid butter being served in 50 years of travelling the planet .  We were led to believe there are 4 restaurants  the primary restaurant which is by any criteria a canteen is the only place one can eat . There are 2 other restaurants one was closed ( and one would have to pay anyway ) the other allowed 1 meal during the stay . Needless to say the food there was no better .  Enquiry into the location of the other restaurant only confirmed that there wasn’t one although there was a snack bar and a pizza oven ! The Safran and Cafe Maure are one and the same and we never saw any Spanish food .  The room was small and the wardrobe tiny viz. 2 small draws and 6 hangers  no facility to make a hot drink . The bathroom had mould growing up the walls in the shower and the basin plug was faulty and drained slowly .,Date of stay: February 2023,,"Winchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikeegarvey

Room cleaners after cleaning my room robbed me…they took money from my bag which was zipped. Also money gone from the spa locker. In additional to that my friend was robbed too after they clean his room. When we checked-in the guy showed us safe but I didn’t think to keep things there as I suspect it’s my room no one going to take anything. Obviously items they were in my back not on the table. After all that experience I went to the guest service and she just apologised and didn’t do anything. She said she will do investigation but never came to me to say the outcome. That was really shocking…Finally just want to say if you stay in this hotel be careful and carry money with you as you will be robbed.,Date of stay: February 2023,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G3433UCgabrielef

It is a bit outside of the city center (but then again you get to enjoy the quiet of the place) but there is an excellent shuttle service and the hotel staff will help you get taxi's if you want to venture into town.

Sol Oasis is a beautiful hotel. The staff are extremely polite and welcoming - anything you need they are happy to help. The food is nice and they cater to different cuisines daily. The room was picture perfect and we had the cutest balcony with a view of the overall hotel (including pool and entertainment area).  I would definitely come back again and recommend to EVERYONE I know.  The staff (again) we’re so friendly and even got my shy self to sing at Karaoke because they were so supportive!

Sol Oasis Marrakech,Owen Tonkin wrote a review Feb 2023,50,Amazing time staying at the Sol Oasis Marrakech,Me and my partner stayed at the Sol Oasais Marrakech for 11 night all include and I have nothing but positive comments to give. The staff from reception to kitchen and bar were so helpful and made you feel at home. You were always being looked after and attended to if you needed anything. The entertainment team was where it really impressed me they were always approaching you to make sure you were having fun and wanting to take part in the daily activities that were running. I highly recommend the dance performances that run every other evening. The room was cleaned immaculately every day and the food was 10/10.    If you are considering staying here then just GO FOR IT!! You’ll have the best experience staying in Marrakech Morocco.    P.S they also include free shuttle busses for you to go into the centre of Marrakech which saves a lot of money.,Date of stay: February 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/418owent

Sol Oasis Marrakech,charlotte s wrote a review Feb 2023,40,Lovely Time,We came here with our 1 year old and had a lovely time. The rooms are finished well and an even the basic room was a great size for the 3 of us. The shuttle bus was very handy and made going into Marrakesh really easy. We made use of the kids club with us present and our daughter really enjoyed the change of scenery and has a lovely little park next to it which was enjoyed. The staff all made us feel welcome and love children. Wahiba in the kids club was really friendly and happily got involved in play with the children to give them a nice time.    Cons - Children’s Pool was not heated as advertised. The high chairs in the main restaurant were not regularly cleaned. Food was ok a lot of variety but didn’t compare to the food we had while out in Marrakech.,Date of stay: February 2023,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B3892VIcharlottes

Sol Oasis Marrakech,Gillian E wrote a review Feb 2023,50,Excellent hotel,My sister two friends and I returned last night from 5 days away at this hotel.  The staff and hotel were excellent. The reception and check in was quick and the reception staff very helpful.  Entertainment was great and we found that Sam organised sessions where you could be taught how to cook certain dishes or types of bread. Shows and entertainment during day and evening. They all worked so hard.    There was a wide variety of food available something for everyone. There was another restaurant on site which is free but you have to book and we found the food was good enough in the restaurant. I thought I wouldn’t like the wine but did. Staff were quite happy to put my tea in a ‘pot’ rather than a cup. Clean and efficient. Buffet style but no queues as food well spread out.    Bar closed at 11 pm but we just made sure we had some extra glasses.  We didn’t use the spa but you can use the indoor pool if you have a treatment.    If you want anything just ask rooms clean and best shower ever. Staff were so pleasant.    Free shuttle into Marrakech throughout the day. We went on the shuttle but came back in a taxi. That was an experience.    There were only a couple of things that could have made it better which are so simple.. a kettle in the room (there apparently were in the larger rooms) a booklet telling you all the activities that are on site times restaurant was open (there is also a snack bar open most of the day) how to get your pool towels and where and a reminder of all the things they tell you when you arrive. You forget so easily what they have to offer. My bed was so comfortable.    I would certainly go back to this lovely hotel. It has so many extras and if anyone asks I would send them here.,Date of stay: February 2023,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/999gilliane

Sol Oasis Marrakech,AHlondon wrote a review Feb 2023,40,Winter Sun Paradise,If there were an option to give 4.5/5 I would do so thoroughly enjoyed our stay here.    The excellent reviews are entirely justified.  The ground/cleaning staff work tirelessly so the place is spotless.  The animation team are a bundle of infectious energy getting to know all the guests by name but are happy to leave you alone too. Sam is a real asset and the quality of the entertainment is good.  The newly opened Spa was a wonderful surprise. We had Hammam treatments and massages - really good value at 60 euros for 60 minutes and the treatments were incredible. You can use the indoor pool before and after treatments which was lovely.  Food was excellent for an AI buffet lots of local cuisine and a fresh cooked station for pasta meat and fish. Breakfast was plentiful and varied. We ate at the Moroccan restaurant but to be honest we preferred the buffet.  The rooms look just like they do in the photos we had a lovely little balcony - so ask for one of those if you can.  There is an agent on site to book trips with who was really helpful and we negotiated a really good value trip into the city with a private driver and guide. Highly recommend Rashid as a guide.    The reason I don't give it 5 stars?  I would have liked drinks to be served to you at dinner instead of having to serve yourself water and wine. The cocktails were not great. Drinkable but I would not have paid for them. The indoor bar was better than the pool bar. Poolside drinks service would have been nice as there was usually quite a wait at the bar and this was with the hotel at very low capacity    I would absolutely return to this hotel - excellent value for money for some winter sun.,Date of stay: January 2023,,"Essex, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AHlondon

Everything from the food to the staff to the weather was fantastic. The food was always varied with some really delicious local dishes (the tagines were amazing) as well as freshly made pizzas pasta etc. The staff and the animation team couldn’t do enough for you and were so friendly and interactive which made us feel so warm and welcome. Had some great chats with all the animation team. The cleanliness of the hotel was top notch and the rooms were very clean. We were lucky enough to enjoy at least 6 hours of warm sunshine almost every day which was weather you could sunbathe in and didn’t expect at this time of year. The evenings were a little chilly but the fire pits and heaters create a lovely outdoors warm environment for the evenings. The free shuttle is also an excellent service into Marrakech as private taxis would be fairly expensive.

Sol Oasis Marrakech,SmileyBean wrote a review Jan 2023,50,Possibly the best place to stay near Marrakech,Everything about this small resort is almost perfect. Although I found a few small niggles such as some of the hot food on the buffet actually being lukewarm the friendliness of the staff and the whole atmosphere of care and quality more than make up for them.  I have to admit never having been to an all inclusive resort before but having spoken to several others who have as well as travelers in Marrakech staying at other resorts I think we were extremely lucky in our choice of what has turned out to be a fantastic place.  There is food and drink available all day until 11 pm great entertainment all day and into the evening and a lovely selection of places to chill including heaters and fire pits in the terrace on cooler evenings.  The pool is warm (27 Deg) with a separate kids pool and play area and there are a range of other activities available like football basket ball archery and table tennis.  Although a 20 to 30 minute drive from the city there is a free regular mini bus as well as a rep with a selection of excursions in the foyer.

Sol Oasis Marrakech,sandie954 wrote a review Jan 2023,40,EXCEEDED EXPECTATIONS,First time in Marrakech so didn't know what to expect but this hotel certainly ticked most boxes. Beautifully designed and maintained; lovely gardens which were lit up with lanterns at night - big swimming pool. Service from all staff was excellent - nothing was too much trouble. Situated on the outskirts rather than the noisy centre but provided a peaceful retreat and the shuttle bus ran frequently to the town. Only minor suggestions - trays of food weren't kept hot once laid out in the buffet - such a shame as the food was so good but often cold. Music usually finished early but a private party on our last night played music so loud despite being inside the theatre a long way from our room- apparently they didn't keep the door closed. It went on until 12.40am. Otherwise I would have rated it higher - but it wouldn't stop me booking again.

We only stayed for 3 nights and wish it was longer. The weather was perfect. Not too hot and not too cold.

Sol Oasis Marrakech,May wrote a review Jan 2023,40,A relaxing oasis,I had an overall very relaxing getaway at this all inclusive resort. What initially drew me in were the gardens greenery photos of the suites and community areas. I wanted to stay somewhere that really captured Moroccan style decor and ambience. Checking in was pretty quick. the receptionist was friendly and helpful. An issue immediately arose when I noticed my suite did not have a balcony attached. The receptionist was able to resolve this discrepancy quickly and placed us in a room with a balcony view. Once settled in our room we were immediately looking for food or something to snack on. One of my cons was that room service came with an extra charge/service fee; which is unlike my experience at other all inclusive resorts. There was a variety of finger foods outside by their outdoor bar but there wasn’t a proper barrier or method to keep flies away. Breakfast lunch and dinner was served in a common hall à la cart style. they had a large variety and essentially something in there for everyone. breakfast however was my least favorite. There wasn’t much variety. I got to a point where I didn’t even wake up for breakfast. also the Moroccan restaurant on ground that requires a reservation is essentially the same food as the common hall for other meals. The spa I was under renovation when we arrived but thankfully opened before our departure. I enjoyed a spa day before I left and it was the highlight of my stay. The pool was large and nice but I wish it were warmer. The weather during my stay was no higher than 75 Fahrenheit. I think this resort is perfect for families as there were a handful of children during my stay. The resort staff also did a perfect job catering to Christmas holiday decor festivities and meals. All in all my first visit to morocco was a success.

A desert paradise. It's such a relaxing and beautiful place. NYE party was amazing with lots of entertainment - live bands belly dancers fire eaters DJ disco plus gala dinner cocktails etc the hotel went over and above to make the night special.  The hotel is spotlessly clean and the rooms are lovely. There are 3 heated pools (one in spa) with lots of loungers and additional deck chairs under trees etc.  The food is plentiful and delicious with multiple tagine options pasta station salad meat desserts and international themed nights (Italian Oriental Mexican to name a few).  ALL the staff are absolutely AMAZING so friendly and went out their way to make our holiday special a HUGE asset for the hotel. The Bar staff were brilliant remembering your drinks no matter what time of day it was however the true gem was Mohsine he was always full of smiles. The Animation/Entertainment team WOW. They worked really hard providing things to do through the day - darts tagine cookery demos aerobics etc and the shows at night were FANTASTIC. The jewel has to be Sam he kept up entertained (Mr McGregor says Hi ) but a HUGE shout out the rest of the team Russ and his beautiful wife Sousou Mike (aka Michael Jackson) Abdel and not forgetting Fatima (keep going with the scottish lingo!). The best entertainment I've had in a hotel for a long time - well done everyone!!.  There is a free shuttle running multiple times through the day will take you into Marrakech and pick you up after. Also you may wish to book trips from Hotel Hicham was very helpful.  You will not be disappointed with this desert gem we had a fantastic time and would recommend this hotel to anyone.

Every day he was full of smiles greeting and attending to us with such enthusiasm. And he makes cracking cocktails.  All of the animation team work really hard but for us it was Sam that was made our stay most enjoyable. He remembered our names after being introduced on our first night. We loved getting involved with his activities as he's so funny yet extremely respectful. We played darts with him as well as learnt Moroccan and how to make a tagine.  New year's Eve: the hotel went all out to make the dining room look amazing. There was live music and a DJ. Everyone had such a great time.  A free shuttle running multiple times through the day will take you into Marrakech and pick you up after. You just need to book at reception.  We thoroughly recommend this hotel.,Date of stay: December 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Spalding, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y3289BQaliciac

Sol Oasis Marrakech,Mass J H wrote a review Jan 2023,50,Simply perfect - we will be back. Again and again.,We are in the Luxury hospitality industry so when we say Wow. We mean WOW. Sol Oasis is literally that. A paradise oasis in constant sunshine. We have escaped the UK winter- currently 2 celcius- and even at the height of Moroccan winter we have eternal blue skies with 26 degrees of glorious African sun. The 3 swimming pools are heated and oh so perfectly laid out around the food and beverage offering.  The food offering is astronomical and the flavours of Moroccan traditional cooking are delicately sewn into every dish with enough choice to please even the most conservative palatte.  The real jewels in the crown of this Dessert Paradise are the staff. They make British hospitality look stupid. The owners should be proud. I wish I could name each and every one. Their constant smiles and ability to anticipate your needs before even you can are second to none. I will name just a humble few but the entire compliment of staff are on another level. Fatima in the Entertainment team is the most epic asset along side are Sousou Russ Sam Mike Abdel and Waheba who are beyond epic. The Bar staff - Mochine and crew will serve mixology magic with a smile. FOH and waitering teams in the restaurant including Abdelilah and Zacheria serve to a standard we dont see in the UK unless your paying Michellin prices. The cleaning and housekeeping  staff keep this place spotless. If you are deciding on a place to stay in Morrocco - your search is over. There may be no beach but the Atlantic here is freezing year round so dont look at that as a benefit. Visit Sol Oasis.

Sol Oasis Marrakech,Binder G wrote a review Jan 2023,50,Best decision of 2023,We went on a chilling holiday trip for 3-night. It is an all-inclusive hotel and is 20 minutes from the city centre which we wanted the hotel has a shuttle you can book by letting reception know. The hotel is clean and friendly and has a warm welcoming atmosphere as soon as you enter. The staff is AMAZING and very accommodating they go out of their way to help.  The rooms are clean and roomy clean lines with tiled floors. I had to move as I did want to be near the entertainment which the hotel changed for me so if want the same do not get rooms in front of the pool area.  Every day the food has a theme of Italian French Morocco etc. The only thing is if do not drink dairy then you need to make them aware of this as other types of milk will need to be arranged by them with notice.  The Spa in the hotel is AMAZING with gorgeous decor and a wonderful staff that felt like family. They do everything you want from a spa and have a beautiful indoor heating pool.  The in-house entertainment is great they really get you involved and work hard to make sure you have a good time  A massive THANK YOU to all the staff but a special mention to Harja from the front house and Samah from the spa,Date of stay: January 2023,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/binderg2016

Sol Oasis Marrakech,Wayne Norris wrote a review Dec 2022,40,Great Hotel.,"Pros:  - Excellent food and drinks- best selection I've ever seen at an all inclusive  - Room good and was cleaned every day  - Shuttle bus runs frequently throughout the day and drops at a good location  - Sports gym and other facilities really good  - Most staff members were pleasant and helpful. Fatima sat with my girlfriend for 20 minutes while I was getting ready - they go above and beyond the line of duty  - Impressive shows that included traditional Morrocan dancing and fire juggling.  - Morrocan Tea - it's revolutionary    Cons:  - Difficult to relax and read a good book by the pool when R&B music is blasting all day. A bit of variety and less volume would be best for this type of audience.  - Entertainment staff were energetic great to the kids and helpful. I admire their daily positively. However they were trying to get me to dance every night. Look I'm no stranger to the dancefloor but ""forced fun"" is not my thing. People have different interests even in a holiday environment.    Overall this is a great hotel and I would come back to stay. Just take it easy on me next time.

Sol Oasis Marrakech,sid_wise wrote a review Dec 2022,30,Disappointing service,Over experience was disappointing. Service was generally poor. Rooms were not ready at checkin. Information and orientation at checkin was rushed. No information about the facilities pool towels etc. Had to request a cot bed several times that did not arrive until the evening.    Laundry was not collected even after 3 days. No answer at reception despite calling several times. Not enough childrens high chairs at meal times and were not cleaned in between. Meal selection was generally good and decent quality however the breakfast egg station needs improvement. Eggs were made very haphazardly. All broken and half raw.    Kids club was good and entertainers were very energetic and caring. Main pool temperature was okay but kiddy pool was freezing and not suitable for kids.    The rooms were generally clean and nice. However when we arrived there was a strong paint smell so we had to open all windows and ventilate. Also there was a faint raw sewage smell from the drain in the bathroom during the day.,Date of stay: December 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Nairobi, Kenya",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sid_wise

Sol Oasis Marrakech,rob wrote a review Dec 2022,50,Great hotel,After reading the positive reviews on trip advisor my wife and I decided to book 5 nights at the sol oasis Marrakesh. We were not disappointed. The rooms were beautifully decorated and had a traditional Moroccan feel to them along with the beautiful setting. We booked the all inclusive option and the food as well as drink was plentiful there was lots of variety and selection and each day had a different theme.  The pool area and gardens were well maintained peaceful and plenty of sun lounges available. The pool bar was also great this did shut at 11pm although there was another bar open till 1 am.  The entertainment team work tirelessly but nothing is too much trouble. They all take their time to get to know guests even guests who just want to relax. Especial shout out to Russ.  The only negative was our experience with the security guard when leaving the hotel who was demanding papers not given to us by reception. However this was dealt with by reception and a follow up email from the manager. Despite this we will definitely return.,Date of stay: November 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Blackpool, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robsy

Sol Oasis Marrakech,Rowhana B wrote a review Dec 2022,20,Beware of cats!,We stayed in Dec 2022. Temperature was 20 degrees average. Its cold in the mornings before midday so you will need warm clothes.    Our main issue and the reason why I've rated this hotel 2 stars is because of the cats. Stray cats are constantly in the buffet restaurant. The doors are left open and guests also bring them in. The French guests in particular liked them. But they should not be in the dining room so unhygienic. They were climbing on the tables and sofas. We kept jumping out of our seats as they ran under our feet. The staff did not care. I complained many times and nobody seemed to care. What if someone was allergic to cats? Well if you are this is not the place for you. I also complained to the general manager and he promised it would be fixed the next day still nothing. Guest experience manager Hajar told me nothing could be done as most of the guests like the cats. I told her to print notices for the doors so guests know not to bring in the cats she said she had printed them we didn't see anything during our stay so I'm guessing this was a lie. So basically they don't care about the 10% only the 90% who are French or locals. Other (UK) guests were also uncomfortable.    Anwyay our whole experience was ruined by these cats and the hotel's total disregard about the issue. The food was nice but what's the point when you cannot sit and eat in peace? One day in a fit of rage I had to take food back to my room as I couldn't stand it anymore.    During check out our 1 year old got quite ill we asked for the nurse to come who was useless couldn't speak English and took our daughters temperature in the most bizarre way. We waited for a doctor who never came. So if you're travelling with toddlers or elderly beware that you will be helpless in an emergency.    Our bathroom was also full of flies. I've uploaded a video. The cleaners just had to spray the vents which would have resolved the issue. We waited 2 days a can of bug spray was left in our room for us to do this ourselves but was taken back the next day.    We were on ground floor and the floor was full of ants. Don't know why nothing was ever done about this.    We asked for a cot to be in the room but it wasn't so had to ask again and when it arrived it was broken.    Most staff are nice but some reception staff are rude and lazy. They need to be more proactive.    Tour guide Mr Higham (Mr Hisham) will fleece you and keep the money for himself. Don't buy anything from him. He will over-sell.    Even though there is a free shuttle bus to the centre it takes 30 mins and doesn't quite drop you in the center. Timings are also not great.    This hotel does need to make improvements. It's not a 4 star hotel. I was very happy to be leaving and even paid a taxi driver extra to leave earlier as I couldn't stand another meal being attacked by cats!,Date of stay: December 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rowbo1988

Have to mention Russ-Sam-Sousou-Mike -Fatima-Abdul-Wahiba-Dounia-Red1-Khalid-Ahmed-Niako and lots more  Miss you already  So clean and very comfy bedsso much food choice great value for money.  Perfect for families with children as they are made to feel so special  They were still in the World Cup whilst we were there and the atmosphere was electric and I don’t even like football.  The front desk were so kind to us because we managed to fuse our bedroom several times by a faulty adapter but they moved us to another room no problem at all and as soon as we can got into the new room the same thing happened.  Of course we didn’t know until the second room fused that the problem was ours but they literally could not do enough to help us.  We can’t wait to get back. Not so sure if they agree we were a pain fusing the rooms  Honestly can’t say enough about this place it deserves the five star reviews.

Mike is a top man amd brilliant dancer and along with Sam Fati Russ Sousu and Nikao they are all so friendly and so much fun. The grounds and pool are nice and well kept.    I have only given it 4 stars for 3 small reasons;  1. The food was very nice however it was repetitive and not much variety compared to other AI holidays I've been on  2. The rooms are nice but our bathroom had lots of flies in it all the time and splat marks where other guests have killed them. There was also plaster coming off the walls at the shower  3. The bar staff are brilliant and kept us well refreshed however on our last night we realised the barman (Bati or similar) was giving us very little to no spirits in our drinks. He kept insisting he would bring the drinks over and we could only taste Coke and when I stayed at the bar to watch him por them it was clear as day.    Despite those small negatives the good far outweigh the negative and we will be looking to return next year.    Make sure you try the pizzas outside for dinner or as a snack during the night. They were incredible.    Also some 5 star reviews and the ones that say they are writing it at the hotel would appear to be due to staff walking round and asking people to help them with their review. They then took photos of said review so don't know if they make commission on that but it seemed strange to me (I was never asked but someone in our company and others sitting nearby were).,Date of stay: November 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/meatwka

Sol Oasis Marrakech,Georgina Moore wrote a review Dec 2022,40,An honest review :),First and foremost we had a lovely time. The staff go well above & beyond for you and are just so friendly. The hotel grounds are well kept and beautiful. The pool area is huge and plenty of beds always available. Evening entertainment is one of the best weve experienced and we had such a fun time. Sadly though a star was docked for the food im afraid. Whilst they have different theme nights every night the food isnt great quality or variety and I actually barely ate anything due to this! Sad really as the rest of the hotel is fabulous. They also dont mention on the website that you have to pay for the use of the tapas restaurant which i wish i would have known before as may well have chosen elsewhere as we like to have lots of food choice! Nevertheless we still had a great time at the Sol Oasis. They run free shuttles in to the medina too which was a great touch :) Thanks everyone at Sol Oasis for making our time in Marrakech so special!,Date of stay: December 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MissGVM

Arrived at the Sol Oasis via private transfer and greeted by extremely happy smiling staff to take our cases and help check us in. From that moment we were so impressed not only by the beautiful hotel but more so the staff. Every one was truly lovely and very attentive. Sam and Su Su were always very happy and cheery and took time to sit and chat. The entertainment team overall are fantastic and bar the staff remembered what drinks we had after the first day.  Already planning on returning in May with my parents.  Such a wonderful week away and the weather was lovely for the time of year.  For now it’s goodbye but we will be back soon.

The foot was outstanding every night and that's coming from a fussy eater!  The saff where more than happy to go above and beyond the entertainment was fantastic Every evening and was never the same! During our stay the world cup was showing in which they showed every game on a projector inside.    On the entertainment side Sam was outstanding very happy and enthusiastic with all the right intentions and having guests best interest at heart all the time. SuSub along side with Sam was also amazing in her role of providing entertainment.

Sol Oasis Marrakech,JAB wrote a review Dec 2022,40,Enjoyed this holiday 😊,Thoroughly enjoyed our holiday at Sol Oasis. Beautiful gardens although a lot of planting still being done the seating areas etc were lovely and we particularly liked the huge firepits on the terrace in the evening. Everywhere kept lovely and clean. Entertainment was excellent animation team very friendly and hardworking. We enjoyed the 2 guitarists that played most evenings too. Some of the music in the daytime got a bit noisy for us as we prefer to read and enjoy the peace. All the food we ate was excellent very impressed with the buffet restaurant one of the nicest we are not usually fans of them but plenty of seating inside and out and relaxed atmosphere. A la carte and snack areas also very good. The bar staff were fantastic Shame about the plastic glasses (can understand the need by the pool but not on the terrace or bar) also most premium spirits were not included in the all inclusive which was a shame but wines were fairly good. Room was nice but would have liked a balcony not all rooms have these. Also was disappointed nothing stocked in the fridge nor any kettle/tea or coffee facilities in the room. We not big breakfast eaters so a coffee/tea/OJ in the room would have been good. Shuttle bus into Marrakesh was a bonus and was straight forward to book when we stayed. All in all a very good experience and we would definitely return to this hotel especially for winter sun.,Date of stay: November 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Derby, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jubu1962

Sol Oasis Marrakech,Morpeth69 wrote a review Dec 2022,50,Don't hesitate - book this hotel!,We stayed at the end of November on an all inclusive package for one week.    We had great weather most of the time - hot enough to lounge by the pool all day and then cool enough in the evening to enjoy the fire pits in the outside bar area.    The hotel is about 20 mins outside of Marrakech - the hotel provide a free shuttle throughout the day.    The hotel has a lovely relaxed atmosphere - all the staff (bar dining room reception entertainments) are super helpful and friendly. Sometimes in all inclusive resorts the bars can be mean but here the beer wine and cocktails flow!    The rooms are modern with everything you would expect (safe fridge nice shower etc) and housekeeping do a great job - like magic fairies tidying up our mess every day.    The food is plentiful and there is a lot of choice - quite a meat based set of options. Not haut cuisine but you won't go hungry. There is hardly an hour of the day when food isn't available - snacks in the afternoon are a nice touch.    If you like fitness and activities there are plenty of options - nice gym yoga space tennis court volley ball court pool tables. I had the facility to myself each time I used it. The pool is particularly nice.    The entertainments team are very enthusiastic and try to involve everyone. Its not my thing but plenty of people enjoyed games (bingo karaoke etc) and performances in the evening.    We were here during the World Cup - big screens available for all matches!    There is a rep onsite offering day trips. The hot air balloon ride was a truly memorable experience - everything from having coffee by the fire before the sun rose as the balloons were readied right through to the landing was unbeatable and a genuinely once in a life time experience. You really get what you pay for! We also booked the city tour - which I would not recommend. Shepherded from one shop to another and gently pressured into buying. We had a better time doing our own walking tour using a guide book!    So all in all - would really recommend this hotel.,Date of stay: November 2022,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Morpeth69

Sol Oasis Marrakech,Sheila H wrote a review Nov 2022,50,Beautiful hotel 5 star in my opinion.,No high rise buildings here ground and one floor above. Rooms fine bedding comfy bathroom large with good shower power. Food is fabulous something for everyone and plenty to choose from.  Outside area is big room for plenty of sunbeds round the pool. Lovely gardens ideal for a cool off in a deck chair amongst the palm trees for shade. So picturesque. Shuttle bus into Marrakesh is provided free a few times a day & incls return. This is ideal as there is nowhere to walk to outside the hotel as it's in the desert about 5 miles from city centre. But you will find after the hot and hectic city that it's a godsend to return to the calm of this beautiful hotel. All staff helpful and smiling.  So glad we stayed here. Thank you to everyone who works at this hotel for making guests feel so welcome.

When I first got there I did initially think what am I going to do for ten days!  I was so wrong....it was a great base to do other things..Atlas Mountains and an unforgettable balloon ride as an example. The real key that made it was the absolutely amazing entertainment team...the enthusiasm and energy so real ...led by my new friend Aniko.  So hilarious professional and talented...

Sol Oasis Marrakech,Alexandra wrote a review Nov 2022,50,Highly recommended,This hotel is great! Everyone mentions the animation team who are fun and attentive but so are the rest of the staff there. All very helpful and with a smile on their faces. The food was very tasty and plentiful. Some reviews mentioned flies on the food served outdoors in the snack bar. The hotel must be reacting quickly to these reviews because when I was there the outside food was covered by clingfilm. Everywhere is kept spotlessly clean. The shuttle into Marrakech is frequent throughout the day/evening but make sure you book it at reception a day or 2 in advance if you want a specific time. I’m glad I stayed in this hotel rather than a Riad in Marrakech. The city is crazy noisy and polluted so it’s good to be able to visit for half a day and retreat back to the calm of the hotel. You can book day trips either at the hotel or via trip advisor (cheaper) and the company will pick you up from the hotel. Check out is at 12pm but if you’re flight is later you can ask for late check out and pay a little extra or you can continue to use all the facilities except your room at no extra charge. I highly recommend a stay here.,Date of stay: November 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alexandra1234321

Sol Oasis Marrakech,lizaadamssmith wrote a review Nov 2022,50,Exceptional hotel with great staff,My husband and I visited this resort for one week. It was a fusion of authentic Moroccan hospitality combined with modern high standards and it should have a 5 star rating. All the positive comments are true. The staff cannot do enough to enhance guests' experience. We arrived late at night and the reception arranged for some food to be delivered to our room. I feel that this resort review all the feedback and then implement changes to keep evolving their service.  The room was clean and pleasant. The restaurant was fantastic with a wide diversity of fresh food. The salads were very exciting and totally safe so obviously washed in bottled water. Mohammed and all the waiting team were friendly and helpful. Mohcine and all the bar staff provided exemplary service at the pool and Cactus bars. Ice is safe.  The animation team were extremely hard working and tried to make everyone welcome.  The Cafe Maure was a fantastic experience.  The shuttle bus regularly drops off guests to the Hotel de Ville area in Marrakesh so the isolated location of this resort is not an issue.  There are some flies occasionally which can be a bit annoying.  The only suggestion that I can make would be that the reception has more change so that we can have smaller notes to provide reasonable tips to the staff.  We really enjoyed our stay and would recommend this resort to all. So thank you so much to all the staff including the gardeners and cleaners for an exceptional experience,Date of stay: November 2022,,"Dorchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lizaadamssmith
Sol Oasis Marrakech,Lindsay C wrote a review Nov 2022,50,Perfect hotel for Marrakech,Had a lovely week in the Sol Oasis Marrakech. The hotel is clean staff are friendly & efficient and the food was great. Our room was small but perfect for what we needed.  We arrived late on our first night but with plenty of reception staff on duty check in was efficient and painless.  There are plenty of activities to participate in during the day if you want to get involved in them (coordinated by the animation team) but if not the pool and loungers are immaculate so perfect for relaxing in the sun. You can also use the activities equipment at any time yourself. The pool staff were always quick to help with loungers or umbrellas nothing was too much trouble.  There is free shuttle bus into the city which needs booked in advance at reception but runs regularly and takes about 25 minutes.  Meals were served as a buffet and there was always plenty on offer my personal favourite was the tagine (every single one of them). There is a traditional Moroccan restaurant where you can have one meal which is included in the all inclusive price again the food here was excellent. The Kass bar and pool bar serve the same drinks but it was nice to have a choice of bar to sit at/in.  The evening entertainment started off with two guitarists/singers who were wonderful it was so lovely to sit listening to them then it was over to the animation team for signing dancing and lots of giggles. The animation team all came across as genuine fun people who want to make your holiday enjoyable and forever had a smile on their faces a big shout out to Sam Rada Russ Fatima Abdul and everyone else in the team whose name I didn't catch.  Would definitely recommend this hotel if you want to combine a relaxing pool holiday with the vibrant city or Marrakech and we we enjoyed it so much we are seriously considering booking again for next year.,Date of stay: November 2022,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Traveler121005
Sol Oasis Marrakech,Karen B wrote a review Nov 2022,50,Excellent week of winter sun and smiles.,Comfortable room good shower toiletries provided room tidied every day. Beautiful hotel. Excellent food. Engaging and friendly entertainment team. Friendly staff all round. Few tips and specific mentions. There is a shuttle to and from centre of Marrakesh you must book ahead as it’s well utilised. Food is varied and great quality always different tagines to try. Entertainment team are excellent. Reda (coach)for yoga and aqua aerobics and humour. Russ we first noticed Russ at bingo night with his infectious smile and giggle we soon learned that Russ was an excellent dancer and front man in the Bollywood show. Abdul is a ray of sunlight constantly smiling and so full of energy just watching him be so happy made us smile every day. Miko we noticed half way through the week when he danced his way through EVERYTHING gorgeous smile too. Sam where do we start with Sam the man who can do everything. Welcomed us on day one with a dance lesson alway checking in with us and inviting us to take part in activities. He kept everything running and organised lost count of how many languages he can speak. He took time out on our last day to teach us French boules. All of them were friendly and we would often just sit back and observe they are very caring and great with the young kids. The staff around the pool were attentive always rushing over to help with umbrellas. Sunbed towels are changed every day give a deposit at start of week for a card and swap daily at hut next to pool. Reception staff helpful and happy to print out boarding pass which was required at airport. Spa at hotel is being renovated but we went for a traditional hamman and massage prepare to be stripped and have a thorough experience! Evening entertainment at hotel; there is a guitar duo who play most nights they are brilliant. We had a fantastic week.

Food was very good but not great pasta station was 10/10 however we found the food very reparative but me and my partner are foodies so that might have a factor init omelette station was 10/10 in the morning. The pol area was stunning very relaxing. Free shuttle bus that takes you right into the centre was very handy the road are mad out there 😂 but the Medina is an expensive you have to do at least once if not more. The thing that made the hotel for us were the staff every single member went above and beyond. The whole animation team were the loviest bunch they all spent time and spoke with everyone. Great team.

Sol Oasis Marrakech,tbS8620GZ wrote a review Nov 2022,20,Noisy and not a luxury hotel,While Sol Oasis has kind staff it is a shame that I am giving a negative review because of one staff and company who made our trip horrible. On our last night a company (willing.fr) had checked in for a corporate trip. A group of unruly barbaric men were yelling shouting and banging on doors and walls drunk at 2am. It was loud enough that the entire hotel heard it. We heard a neighbouring guest ask them to be quiet but the men ran to their room started banging on their door and challenged them “you dare ask us to shush?”. We felt unsafe and called the staff twice- once immediately and once again in 45 minutes when no one came to stop them. No one came that night to stop them- we suspect the drunks eventually fell asleep on their own accord. I understand the hotel cannot do anything about occasional unruly guests. But what they can do and did not do in this case was handle the situation. No one showed up this night to stop the drunks.    We spoke to their “Guest Experience Manager” Rachida in the morning to understand what happened. She feigned ignorance changing her lies as we caught them. When we said we felt unsafe she asked why we didn’t call the police. When we said this didn’t reflect well on the hotel she incorrectly assumed we were threatening her with a bad review and aggressively told us “not to go there”. She gave us an extremely generous and super duper thoughtful late check out of an hour as a sign of “good will”. She said she would follow up via email and we have still not heard a response.    Everyone else was extremely lovely. The bartenders and activity team were fun and kind. The staff and reception were really thoughtful and very welcoming hosts. It is a shame their contributions was overshadowed.    I’m sure the hotel will challenge this with a reply. Don’t let them fool you just read the other recent reviews.,Date of stay: November 2022,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tb8620GZ

Sol Oasis Marrakech,Jessica P wrote a review Nov 2022,30,Don’t let the 5 star reviews mislead you!,After reading all of the 5 star amazing reviews I thought this place was too good to be true!    IT IS all the 5 star reviews mention the animation team and not much else. Don’t get me wrong the animation team are great if you want to join in but if that’s not your thing then they can be quite full on!    However they work very hard start early in the morning and finish late at night and everyone always had a smile on their face! So I take my hats off to them.    The hotel itself is very clean however the rooms are small ours didn’t have anywhere to dry our wet clothes which was annoying!    The food at the hotel was the worst food I’ve ever eaten in my life. Bland cold and boring. Some nights we didn’t even eat as the buffet was awful. The only saving grace is they have fresh pizza cooked how you like every night. But pizza gets boring after a while.    We booked the Spanish tapas restaurant one night we arrived at our booked time and waited 20 minutes for the waiter to bring us menus we were then told that we had to wait another 20 minutes before we could order food. He told us the manager was coming down to talk to us we waited 15 minutes before we left. We passed the manager he did try and get us to go back but at this point we had waited so long we just needed to eat. You have to pay extra for the tapas so you think they would be encouraging more guests to use it and have better service. Most of the time it sits empty.    The hotel itself is lovely and so are the staff the food however really let’s this hotel down.,Date of stay: November 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jessicap667
Sol Oasis Marrakech,Emma R wrote a review Nov 2022,30,Not for us,The positives: The hotel is spotlessly clean and is well furnished in the communal areas. Our room was well set up with a very comfortable bed and nice bedding. The bathroom had a hairdryer that was powerful and the shower was excellent. The two acoustic singers by the bar in the evenings were very good. The free shuttle service into Marrakech was great.    The negatives: The bathroom door is a swing type so has a gap where they meet so not quite as private as a bathroom should be.    Food was at best average. You get one night (without a surcharge) at the restaurant and the rest of the time you have to eat in the buffet restaurant where the food is ok but flies are flying around the food and the hot food wasn’t very hot . The one night we had at the restaurant my meal was pleasant enough but my husbands was in his words 'the worst he has ever had' with other people around us complaining about their food being cold. The waiter was however very nice and there was a nice atmosphere to the place.    So many reviews go to town on how wonderful the animation team are we actually found them too full-on and extremely irritating and actually disingenuous. They were constantly coming over whilst we were laying by the pool and asking us to join in the games (water volleyball darts table-tennis belly dancing etc) which we said we're just not interested in but we were asked every day about 5 times a day and made to feel bad for not joining in. On one of the days my husband and I were on our loungers he was lying there with his eyes closed when one of the female animation team came over and stroked his foot to wake him up and ask him if he wanted to join in one of the games!! This same person collared us one evening at the bar sat herself down (without asking) and helped herself to our snacks and then tried to force me to go on to my phone and write a 5 star review. I refused she became quite insistent trying to make me do it I stuck my heels in and said no.    I have to say though that the animation team do work very hard they are there from morning to night and I’m sure lots of people enjoy them but sorry just not for us.    If you're after a relaxing quiet holiday this place is not for you. The music is on throughout the day right by the pool where people are trying to relax read books listen to podcasts etc and it is blasted so loudly that the speakers were actually making the music sound distorted. We've been on plenty of holidays where there's music by the pool and it’s great but at full blast it's just not enjoyable. We felt it is trying to be an 18-30's holiday but even the younger guests mentioned to us that they found the music ridiculously loud. There are also a lot of conferences which take place here with hordes of people and they have their own music near to the pool so you have the pool music and the conference music fighting each other it really was unbelievable!    On the Saturday night the music by the bar went on until 2am and it was so loud! We also couldn't understand why the staff had moved all the sun loungers onto the grass and then at about 4am they were all moved back making the most hideous scrapping noise which went on for ages.    in conclusion if you are up for lots of games late nights and want to join in then you'd probably enjoy it here - for us it was all too much as we wanted to have a chilled out holiday but felt we needed a holiday to recover from this one!,Date of stay: November 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J6714RUemmar

Sol Oasis Marrakech,Mouhab M wrote a review Nov 2022,50,Magnificent hotel,Just returned from a 2 week stay at Sol Oasis Marrakech with my partner and family. We were there end of October to the start of November and the weather was so hot.    On arrival you walk through a beautiful archway with a stunning walkway to reception.    Reception staff were friendly and helpful and got us checked in quickly.    We were taken to our rooms and luggage arrived by trolley so we didn’t have to carry them to our room ourselves which was good and not like some other resorts. The rooms were beautiful and colourful and always kept clean. We were in room 1706 and our house keeping lady was outstanding (sorry forgot her name).    For all inclusive the food selection was impressive and very fresh and had a lot of various cuisine. There is a pasta station inside the restaurant and log burner for cooking fresh pizza outside the restaurant which is absolutely amazing! Big thanks to Rachadi the head chef and Jamal for the delicious food.    The bar and waiter service was exceptional and very hard working guys. They always remembered what we liked to drink and they have a big range of cocktails/mocktails. The alcohol is of good quality. Big thanks to Mohssin  Bira Nordine Toufik Redwane and not to forget Nizar who went above and beyond.    There is 2 separate restaurants within the hotel aswell as the all inclusive which are the Moroccan restaurant and a Tapas restaurant. We had a meal in the Moroccan restaurant and the food was absolutely gorgeous. Special thanks to Abdelilah/Orika.    The pool area had plenty of Sun loungers for everyone. The pool was a good size and never felt crowded. It was a nice place to relax and wasn’t too noisy.    The entertainment team all worked well together and had great enthusiasm. You could see they all loved what they do especially during their evening shows their happiness spilled out of them. There is a lot of day time activities throughout the day to take part in if you want to they don’t push you into them unlike other hotels. We were there over Halloween and the Halloween show was outstanding! Big thanks to Sam Dounia Russ Sousou Mike Khalid Khredala Niako Wahiba and the FRAM team. Also massive thank you to Houccine the main man in charge of this fabulous team.    Overall thank you so much for an incredible 2 week holiday. We will definitely be coming back and would definitely recommend this hotel.,Date of stay: October 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Dundee, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mouhabm535
Sol Oasis Marrakech,tazzyjay wrote a review Nov 2022,40,Just shy of Excellent an amazing experience x,This review does deserve excellent but a few minor points meant I had to give this very good instead of excellent .. we arrived on the 31st October for a 7 Nights Stay . A hotel with class and some of the best staff that can be found I have ever come across absolutely an amazing hotel. The room was beautiful but because we had our son staying with us the sofa could have been better quality we had to ask a few times to get the adjustments correct but we got there in the end we were staying all inclusive so it can be a hit and miss .  Restaurant times were breakfast 7till 10.30. Breakfast was 12 pm till 3pm And dinner 7.30 till 10pm if I remember correctly with afternoon snacks between 4 and 6 pm . Plenty of drinks at the various pool bar and quite bar . Fridge in your room with kettle . Plenty of towels and toiletry. You need to pay 100 dirham for your pool towel there are three pools but the indoor pool and spa was closed there was some work going on but the hotel is set in a beautiful scene. There are plenty of things to do and evening entertainment and dayteam are the best I have ever come across Michael aka michael Jackson and the whole team were so so friendly and amazing. Like I said this got very good and not excellent mainly due to the food but that is from our personal preferences nothing to do with variety of fresh juices salads and fresh fresh fruit which was plentiful brilliant chefs and amazing hot food just not all to our personal liking but there was so much food god only knows what they did with the left overs food cooked in front of you you must be very clear with everyone what you want most staff speak very good English the hotel would be very hard pushed to beaten and I am not one to mince my words I had seen many good reviews but I wanted to check it and review it myself the had a free one meal at Moroccan restaurant which we were not told about and some of the other holiday makers felt some info was given in preference to the customers who were regulars at the hotel I found everyone easy to get on with reception very very efficient again this is my personal experience I found as a family we had a really good time at this particular hotel and the staff were very helpful …. BIG QUESTION WOULD WE GO BACK AGAIN yes but half board only as all inclusive is only for the people who will stay stuck at the hotel … we did venture out on excursions and took the free shuttle bus few times into the centre of Marrakech.  I could go on forever but I think I have said what I could just a note on the excursions please make sure if your older in your fifties wear appropriate shoes ie trains with grip for some of the excursions .. prod the rep Hiram and ask away everything was very very very good but just shy of excellent x thank you everyone at the Sol Oasis for making our stay as best as you could …,Date of stay: November 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tazzyjay
Sol Oasis Marrakech,kerriew1999 wrote a review Nov 2022,50,"Best holiday I've ever had, honestly!",I can highly recommend Sol Oasis to anyone looking for a break. You can relax or be entertained all day long.    Lovely weather in the 30s in November. Pool is the perfect temperature! A/C in the rooms are brilliant and are quick to cool your room down. Rooms are cleaned daily with fresh towels given. The presentation and care by the cleaning staff is beautiful.    The entertainment team are absolutely fantastic. They put on impressive dance shows indoors then outdoors most nights games and songs all evening. Sam does a brilliant job at keeping the audience engaged. Everyone can join in with games and activities but if you don't want to you won't be forced. Staff were coming round all day to chat and keep you company. Niako and Mike were amazing to name a couple you can easily find a friend in them! There are also activities throughout the day like pool games sports classes cooking classes even!    The other staff are all also excellent polite and friendly. Bira and Ahmed to name a couple are also fantastic from the bar staff so thank you guys! I wish I could name all the staff because honestly they were ALL amazing and I cannot fault a thing about them. They are so incredibly hard working and we really appreciate all of their efforts.    For all inclusive the food selection is very impressive. A great range from Moroccan to Western food as a VERY picky eater I have managed just fine! Cocktails and drinks are brilliant I highly recommend the 'blue lagoon' cocktail!    My only couple of critiques are that firstly our toilet was wobbly in our room which was loud when getting on and off and so would wake the other person when asleep. Secondly the pool table cues were unfortunately broken and could do with being replaced!    Otherwise thank you for an incredible week that we will never forget I will definitely be back!,Date of stay: November 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Maulden, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kerriew1999
Sol Oasis Marrakech,Daniel N wrote a review Nov 2022,50,Fantastic holiday at the Sol Oasis,We booked a weeks holiday at the Sol Oasis visiting at the start of November.    Overall we have had an excellent time at the hotel especially with quality of entertainment provided by the staff.    The level of customer interaction and engagement was exemplary. I've never stayed at a hotel where I've genuinely become good friends with many of the staff. We found that we were thoroughly entertained every single day. We would have liked to have seen a clearer schedule of events though as at times we were suddenly getting involved in activities at very short notice. But otherwise I can't fault the teams efforts to keep everyone in good spirits.    The hotel itself is well maintained. The gardens are immaculate with neat and tidy rooms. We only had one minor issue with the toilet seat wobbling.    Food choice and quality is good with a decent choice of drinks. The coffee machines however were disappointing as they were dispensing the wrong drinks.    Outdoor facilities are good. The main pool and the seating area around it is clean and tidy. We also found the gym facilities to be quiet and could also easily rent sports equipment for other activities such as table tennis. Only the pool cues were in poor condition.    I did also enjoy the cats freely roaming around the hotel grounds.    Overall my visit Sol Oasis has been amazing.    Many thanks to Niako Mike Sam Bira and the rest of the team. We will be back 👍,Date of stay: November 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danielnJ6894MB

Sol Oasis Marrakech,Travellingteacher78 wrote a review Nov 2022,40,"An honest, balanced review",Just returned from a five night holiday at the Sol Oasis Marrakech and we were overall impressed with our stay.    Room  Our room contained a large double bed and an armchair that converted into a single bed. Space was a little tight when the single bed was out but it was fine for a short stay. Great air-con decent shower comfortable beds a safe and a good sized fridge for keeping water cold. Wardrobe space is a little limited especially if three people are sharing. We also asked repeatedly for a third towel and water glass but never got them.    Food  Buffet breakfasts lunches and evening meals were outstanding. A really great selection of dishes to choose from - genuinely something for everyone. Hot food piping hot and cold food well-chilled. Very very well run part of the hotel - all staff totally on the ball.    Swimming pool  Swimming pool is a really great size for having a good swim and big enough that it never felt over-crowded. The water feels a little cold when you first get in but you soon get used to it. Plenty of sun beds some in direct sun for the whole day others more shaded. We always got a good spot without having to reserve beds at the crack of dawn. Children’s play pool looked amazing for younger guests.    Pool bar  In spite of there only being one or two staff service was always quick and with good humour and a smile. The quality of drinks on the all inclusive package weren’t great and I suspect the beer and wine to be low-alcohol versions. The cocktails were mostly all basic one spirit (single measure) and mixer (lots of juice or fizzy pop) so to my mind not really cocktails but I appreciate that good cocktails are much more time-consuming to mix something that’s not really possible in a busy all inclusive environment.    Grounds  The grounds are really beautifully well-maintained with some lovely planting. There are lots of places to sit in comfort (shaded or sunny) chill out and read a book or have a game of cards. What would make things even better is more regular clearing and cleaning of tables in the bar area. It wasn’t uncommon to see sticky tables and half finished food and drinks left for several hours which certainly accounts for the huge number of flies in that area of the hotel.    Entertainment  The animation team are a great bunch of people and their enthusiasm is infectious. We enjoyed getting involved in some activities such as aqua aerobics darts games in and around the pool and The Squid Game evening but we opted out of other things and nobody was ever overly pushy. We didn’t go to any of the evening shows as we preferred rounding off the evening having a quiet drink and a game of cards in the gorgeously designed and decorated indoor bar.,Date of stay: October 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travellingteacher78

Sol Oasis Marrakech,Connector06713739417 wrote a review Nov 2022,30,"Lacking finesse, quantity over quality",On arrival at the Sol Oasis you are greeted by a beautiful picturesque building.  Check in was short and sweet (with no real information about what was what!) and we presume as we arrived at midnight all the welcome cocktails had been cleared away.  The key cards didn't arrive when we got to the room. The porter let us in and said he would return quickly with new cards. You will find not a lot happens quickly! The staff are very helpful but seem to always have more than 1 conversation on the go so you don't know if they are dealing with you or not?  We were tired and Hungry so ordered room service. Food arrived hot  was tasty and reasonably priced.  The next day we wandered around the grounds and hotel familiarising ourselves with what was where. The hotel and grounds are spotless as was our room.  You have to give a deposit for the pool towel at reception. 100 Derhams each. You can change as often as you want.  The pool is clean  large but somewhat noisy. Plenty of beds and umbrellas.  The pool bar plenty of drinks cocktails and water available. The cocktails are a bit hit and miss as they run out of a spirit and just substitute with another. A Mojito does not taste the same with Gin!  There is a kitchen that opens mid afternoon but be quick as they do not replenish the snacks once gone  The Kasbah. This bar is more refined with better cocktails and real glasses. Somewhere less noisy to sit.  The food hall quantity takes over from quality sadly. We found the food rather bland. More than edible but we had been looking forward to traditional salads and couscous.  The room. Clean large bed and tv. Shower was more than adequate and the soaps etc were fine. Towels and bedding changed daily.  The show. We watched about half an hour of the show one night and decide it wasn't for us but could see a lot of effort had gone into it.  Overall it's a nice place to come for a week. Shuttle bus takes you into Marrakech for free. It's well worth the trip. Don't use your phone as its very expensive!,Date of stay: October 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Connector06713739417

Our room was clean and fresh on arrival with plenty water in the fridge and loads of storage space. Unfortunately the safe was broken but not fixed although we did ask twice. Food was good nice choice. To the bar. I have to mention Safa Shem and Younes. There was one other barman who generally worked days who was also spectacular! They were all brilliant remembering our orders and really going out of their way to make sure we had our drinks quickly. Wonderful guys who made our holiday a very relaxing and fun experience.  The pool is large but chilly! Fine once you're in. There is a kids pool and plenty space around the large pool.  I give it a five even with the broken safe. We had a great time. (Mainly because of the barmen and their excellent service).... :-)  Would highly recommend a stay especially if you have kids.  The entertainers are great and make you feel very welcome.

Sol Oasis Marrakech,Mia J wrote a review Oct 2022,50,Amazing holiday and an amazing team!,There is no surprise as to why the reviews for this hotel are glowing; the hotel is well maintained and spotlessly clean the photos on here really don’t do it enough justice!  As well as serving Moroccan dishes in the main restaurant every evening there is a themed menu which you can find out about in reception. There also a snack bar that doubles up as a fresh pizza station of an evening and an authentic a la carte on site (I’d recommend booking at the beginning of you holiday to ensure a space). Although it’s not all year round the whole team made such an occasion out of Halloween with fantastic cocktails and themed menu.  The thing that really sells this hotel though is the incredible team who all made our holiday so special. Everything is done at 110% and they really do go the extra mile for all of their customers their fantastic shows of an evening are just another added bonus.

Sol Oasis Marrakech,TRACY R wrote a review Oct 2022,50,Fabulous,Just a few words about this little gem of a hotel The reviews say it all - number 9 out of over 700 hotels .............. not to be found on many UK package hotel sites its charm lies in its typically European flavour (anyone that knows the Sol brand will know this!) mixed with the feel of staying in a typical Moroccan Riad. The place is spotless! And the staff are amazingly friendly and encouraging tou to join in as little or as much as you want  Also super talented. Best evening shows we have seen anywhere! Food is fab - family of 4 Inc 2 teens and not one complaint in 7 days. The whe place is Simply perfect...................... Thank you Sol Oasis for having us - we are having a blast! Free shuttle bus to marrakech is a.must but need to pre book as very popular .  Also thoroughly recommend Debbie Calvert at Yalla - Let’s Go Travel for any trip requirements  British lady who lives in marrakech and can tailor make days to your requirements.

Sol Oasis Marrakech,Michelle B wrote a review Oct 2022,10,Terrible start!!!,We have arrived this evening and had a terrible start to our stay here at Sol Oasis!! Travelling with 5 adults and 3 children.  We arrived around 11.15 this evening and by the time we checked in and were shown to our rooms it was almost 12pm. We went to the bar area to see if there was something to eat and drink. We were greeted with the announcement that we would need to pay for anything we had because the all-inclusive we had already paid for ended at 11pm!!! I went to reception expecting to be told there had been a mistake as we didn't arrive until after this time to be told that if we wanted food we should have ordered before arriving!!!!  If the minibar in our room was filled I would not have been so upset but in our minibar was a few pieces of fruit that had passed its best and one bottle of water! This is not a mini bar!!  Even after speaking to the manager who took several times to answer the phone I was given the same response that we had to pay for food and that they were not expected to know we would want something to eat and drink!!! The hotels response was that we needed to speak to guest services in the morning!!! I'm absolutely disgusted with the attitude of the hotel! I'm hoping our stay will improve but given the attitude of the reception staff and manager I'm not hopeful!,Date of stay: October 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michellebU8175VF

Sol Oasis Marrakech,Rima M wrote a review Oct 2022,40,"Oasis outside of Marrakech, but quite a trek outside of the city",Good clean hotel an oasis outside of the hustle and bustle of Marrakech. The rooms are spacious and well decorated. Food is buffet-style with the exception of a couple of restaurants. The bar area overlooks the pool and there is live music every night.    The downside is that it is really in the middle of nowhere you can't go out of the resort for a walk it's all desert. There is a free shuttle into Marrakech but it only holds 15 to 20 people has to be pre- booked and is not that frequent (eg just 3 buses in the morning). And the return bus either comes back at 4pm which is too early or 9pm which is too late. The alternative is taxi at EUR20 each way.    Other not so good aspects: the food is fairly average more canteen-style. We ate better everywhere outside of the hotel. And the live music doesn't stop till 11pm and can be heard throughout the resort so early nights are difficult!,Date of stay: October 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/51rimam

Sol Oasis Marrakech,Mike P wrote a review Oct 2022,50,Just AMAZING !!!,"An honest review we arrived around mid day and was greeted by a smiling bus boy who took all our luggage straight away. The hotel allowed us to check in early which was a pleasant surprise which meant we could unpack and hit the pool straight away.  As soon as we hit the pool we was greeted by the animation team the names to look out for is Sam and Russ but to be honest those are the names I could remember but the whole team are amazing! on a few occasions one of them would join us us for dinner lunch or breakfast and we would exchange stories from each others lives which was nice they made you feel like friends and not just guests Sam even gave us two paintings from his house for us to bring back to the uk for my kids to have they thought they was amazing! thank you again Sam if your reading ""Hey Big mike"".  The food was amazing one of the best all inclusive we have eaten at the deserts are to die for.  it is a good idea to tip the bar staff at the pool well otherwise you que for drinks in the evening where as if you tip well they look after you and bring you drinks etc try the strawberry and vanilla slush with rum just amazing.  If your a typical brit and like a cigar your out of luck buying cigs and cigars at the resort  however if you speak to one of the bar staff they will bring you in a cigar the next day for small fee.  we chose to go with a family room which to be honest im glad we did because the room was massive with a living area it was worth paying the extra £20 for. if you want a terrace be sure to ask for it before you arrive.  the room was very modern and in keeping with the native themes.  we had amazing time at the resort and it was just beautiful I highly recommend sol oasis.  as for for Marrakech its self thats an entirely different review.

After some diligent search by the two of us we zeroed in on a rather appropriately named 'Sol Oases' hotel in Marrakesh Morocco.    Located at the outer rim of Marrakesh it took about 20 minutes to reach the hotel. from the Menara airport. Although dark by the time we reached our chosen 'Shangri-La' One unmistakable impression we were given was the startling resemblance to the world-famous Court Of The Lions building in Granada Spain. It is beautiful and oh so very tranquil! A quality that is unmissable even in the gathering darkness.    The rooms were rather small and there were no bathrobes nor any slippers. Only one 1.5 litre of water bottle of spring water a day was allocated.    On the positive side the breakfast in the morning was lavish with lots of variety and all food seemed freshly prepared and carefully selected. With not so many guests around we served ourselves without being pushed around and had ample time to pick and chose our food. Here too we met some outstanding unsung heroes who are found in many of hotels throughout the world. They are the people who tirelessly work silently to enhance the popularity and reputation of a hotel.    Nabil who was in charge of the workings at the dining hall was one of those strong silent types. He was approachable with ready smile and a positive response to all and any request you come with. No wonder he was surrounded by many appreciating guests.    Here too we met Naoval. A bubbly effervescent smiling and bespectacled energy powerhouse of s woman! Want anything or want to have anything done? Naoval is the one to it...with a smile.    As I was drifting around looking for a tasty morsel or two La Hassan beckoned me on. I soon fell to the charm and delicious pasta and sauce of this large smiling man. This lasted throughout our stay at the place.    Earlier at the reception hard-working and obliging Ilyas and Haitam behind the reception counter and Rashid in front of the counter made their presence felt by being so very obliging. They all went beyond the call of duty to help.    Last but not least I must mention one of the LEAST noticed and very little appreciated women. Not recognized or noticed but Zohra is an extremely vital part of the entire workings of Sol Oases. Quietly but very efficiently she works tirelessly in keeping the rooms immaculately clean and tidy.    All in all Sol Oases is a great hotel to rest in.

Sol Oasis Marrakech,SiRowley wrote a review Oct 2022,50,Amazing,My wife and I booked this trip on a whim and after 10 days we have had the best time. Where do I start?! The place is always clean and tidy the rooms are clean the food is always different and they do a different theme every night and it tastes sooo good. The staff there are amazing. The bar staff are amazing and work so hard. And last but by no means least the entertainment team have made this holiday for us. We read reviews before and everyone mentioned this team but until you experience it for yourself you realise why. During the day if you want to (and they're not pushy if you don't) there's loads to do and it's just really good fun. We've done darts archery table tennis belly dancing Cha Cha Cha and loads more. The evenings have been so much fun the shows that they put on are worthy of a west end performance (seriously). Thank you so much to everyone for making such a memorable holiday for us Xxx,Date of stay: October 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Sutton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SiRowley

Sol Oasis Marrakech,OldCourse wrote a review Oct 2022,50,Had to Write!,Don't always write reviews and I can be cynical reading some. However I have to agree with my fellow reviewers about the Sol Oasis. It's got a certain something that other hotels/AI resorts just don't have a magical joie de vivre I got to practice my French). It's not the biggest resort it doesn't necessarily have the best facilities it's a few miles from town the bars close at 11pm etc yet somehow it conquers all these disadvantages to deliver the perfect holiday experience whether you're 6 or 61 (me). The animation team throughout the day turn into your entertainment team for the evening giving you a different show every night. Big shout out to MC Sam ZouZou Mike Russ and the entire team.    I'm generally not a big fan of buffet style eating and the associated faff of pulling together the components to make up your meal but Sol Oasis make it easy and logical with everything that should go together in the same place. Nice sized main restaurant with tables cleaned and reset regularly so there was never any sense of overcrowding queuing or hunting a table. Very wide selection at all meal times mainly but not exclusively Moroccan. Pizza chicken nuggets and chips also available. The variety and methods of cooking vegetables and potatoes was especially good and for me a beef and prune tagine was the highlight of the week! The beautiful crusty bread at all mealtimes also deserves a mention. Thanks to the Head Chef and his team for their hard work all week and to Nebil and his dining room team for fetching carrying and regular topping up of my wine glass!    Last but not least the bar team work so hard outside in the pool bar all day and into the evening delivering fizzy pop for the kids or cold beers and sophisticated cocktails for the grown ups unflustered and always smiling even on the hottest of days. Thank you Jafar Bira and Nourdane.

Sol Oasis Marrakech,Jo A wrote a review Oct 2022,50,What a place!!!,Wow!!  I've never been to an all inclusive before and so was a bit sceptical but I couldn't have been more impressed. The whole place was so clean and well looked after such a pleasant and beautiful place to stay with plenty to do.    Every single member of staff were so friendly and welcoming but the entertainment crew in particular were just brilliant. They were always full of energy and got us involved in activities as well as hosting fantastic entertainment in the evening. Sam and Abdul in particular went above and beyond to make our stay fun and always put a smile on our faces.    The food was great every night with various themes so there was lots of variety (also 2 restaurants onsite which was a bonus). The drinks were also very generous (thank you especially to Sfar for all our mojitos!)    Overall couldn't fault the hotel.

Every single person that worked here was accommodating and went out of their way to help. There was never a dull moment and the animation team would spend their days chatting to us encouraging us to do activities and evenings putting on amazing shows.

Sol Oasis Marrakech,Gareth wrote a review Oct 2022,50,"Excellent, Must Stay Here",We stayed at this hotel for a week all inclusive and have had the most wonderful stay. The hotel was clean well maintained and overall excellent. From the moment we got to the hotel we felt welcome and calm and the reception team were extremely helpful and pleasant i would like to personally mention Ilias who greeted us when we got there and was constantly helpful and professional throughout out whole trip. The food was great and only seemed to improve through the week and being a fussy eater we constantly found ourselves with a large amount of options whilst all being most enjoyable. The entertainment team was top notch you could see the effort from each and every member and they made us feel extremely welcome and constantly involved the morrocan dance show is definately something not to miss whilst at this hotel. All of the front of house team were exceptional. Always there to help but never in the way polite and friendly. The bar staff were some of the friendiest staff there constantly offering a smile and a quick chat whilst they served you Marcin and Bira are two names id like to mention as i felt personally they went out of their way to ensure service was both exceptional and felt personal to both of us. All of the maintance staff worked exceptionally hard making everything look perfect whilst remaining constantly in the background howver if you did see them extremely polite and helpful. The maids themselves were also very professional careful not to disturb and to provide exactly what you needed. The room was beautiful beds comfortable and the black out curtains are a great touch spacious and easy to use everything seemed to be there if you needed it.  Overall the hotel was stunning staff were amazing helpful and extremely polite. Being out of the main town was perfect for us as a couple and the shuttle running to and from was very convient if you do want to visit Marrakech itself.    I couldnt recommend this hotel enough if you are planning on visiting Marrakech to be completely honest the hotel its grounds rooms and impeccable staff truely made our stay.

The energetic entertainment crew were the life and soul. Big shout outs to RossSam Niako Mike and all the gang. If you like being involved then this is the place for you.

We had complimentary Shampoo / Conditioner / Body Wash / Body Lotion.  The food was varied lots of choice and we had nice meals everyday.  There were plenty of empty sunbeds so there was no morning rush which was so nice it was very chilled and relaxed. You can rent a hotel pool towel for 100 MAD.  Every member of staff was v pleasant and friendly the animation team were amazing lots of activities and entertainment everyday.  On two rainy days the shuttle bus was full so we had to stay on resort.

They are constantly asking people to play games and complete activities and the whole team really do become such a huge part of your holiday almost like they came away with you.    I would say that if you’re adults by yourself or taking your children away you cannot go wrong here as there really is something for everyone.    The pool is huge and a stone throw away from the outside bar there was not righting over sun beds and there was space for everyone.

Sol Oasis Marrakech,adam d wrote a review Sep 2022,50,outstanding in every department. lovely lovely hotel,as someone who doesn't normally do reviews I felt compelled to share our experience of the Sol Oasis Marrakech. we have just enjoyed the best week at this hotel.  firstly it is incredibly beautiful throughout. the rooms are spacious and beautiful the pool area is fab the inside bar is ridiculously gorgeous.  the food was excellent at every single meal. a wide choice of excellent food with options of snacks elsewhere such as stone baked pizzas to order or burgers and fries cooked to order.  The drinks were consistently fabulous and strong!!  but the real gem of this beautiful hotel was the staff. the animation team were outstanding. tirelessly upbeat and engaging. lots of activities for those who wanted them and plenty of space to relax for those who didn't. the entertainment in the evening was of a very high standard always and they were always on hand for a chat or a joke.  but every single member of staff was of a consistently high standard. from the reception team to the bartenders the restaurant staff the gardeners maintenance team and the maids. our maid was so lovely and always went the extra mile to arrange our bedding in a new creative way each day.    there was a very frequent free shuttle into the city throughout the day every day as well as good tours available every day for those who wanted the additional experiences of hot air ballon rides or waterfall trips or tours into the Atlas Mountains camel riding massages and much more.    we are already planning our return to this beautiful hotel which is truly an oasis,Date of stay: September 2022,,"Somerset, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M3634RZadamd

From the restaurant staff to the pool team. They are the most amazing people. They make the hotel feel really welcoming and friendly.    The bar staff were the best!! Mohsin sfar is the best cocktail maker in Morocco! Every day I would go up and ask him to make a new drink and everytime it tasted so good. He was so friendly and super knowledgeable of Marrakesh. 5/5 star for all bar staff.    The entertainment team were all very friendly and each member deserves praise for the fantastic shows and entertainment provided.    One of the staff members who works in the bar by the reception was also super helpful to my mum. He managed to locate the tea they serve at the bar and order it for my mum to take home. I don't remember his name but he was super helpful and respectful to my mum.    The room was amazing and has everything you need including a safe and mini fridge. Lots of storage space and a nice size bathroom.    The hotel is about 20mins from the centre but there is a free shuttle bus that goes into the centre which you have to book but it is fairly easy and hassle free.    There is a gym on site and it has good amount of weights and equipment to do a light workout. There are tennis courts a hard court and finally a football pitch (shoutout to abdel in animation team for organising fun football games). If you like playing sport and getting active this place is perfect for you.    The food was great but one thing they could improve on would be having the allergies on all the food cards. Not speaking Arabic or French it was difficult to understand what food had nuts and what didn't. I was very limited to what I could have some days especially when it came to desserts. I think this could be improved by the hotel but it does not take anything away from the wonderful staff working in the restaurant.    Would defo return to see all the friends I have made at the hotel.,Date of stay: September 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/biz95

Sol Oasis Marrakech,Jason Hamilton wrote a review Sep 2022,50,The animation & Bar staff make this Hotel!,This hotel is fabulous.  Well kept gardens clean rooms staff always on hand in the dining area and well maintained pool area.    What made our experience even better was the bar Staff (Mohssin) & animation team (Niako)  They are certainly worthy of being tipped.  So please tip them!    Only down side is... when you have an evening flight home they don't have spare rooms to for changing / showering for the journey home.  We showered at the pool side & changed in the toilets  However that didn't phase us too much!    Well worth a visit!,Date of stay: August 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JasonHamilton84
Sol Oasis Marrakech,Kathy wrote a review Sep 2022,50,Amazing Animation Team,After a poor start we were kept waiting 3.5 hours to check in despite other families arriving and being checked in ! My husbands back had gone & he could hardly walk after the wait !  The property is large and well kept. The cleaners & gardeners work really hard.  The food was lovely but could have been a little hotter.  What really makes this hotel is the AMAZING animation team ! We laughed all week & they obviously enjoy their jobs making everyone happy ! Good shows aqua gym & Karaoke !  Can’t wait to return but please sort out the check in. I have never stayed in another hotel that thinks this is acceptable & I have travelled the world.

Sol Oasis Marrakech,Meg F wrote a review Sep 2022,50,"great hosts, beautiful hotel, incredible city",My boyfriend and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Sol Oasis in early September.    The staff were very welcoming and friendly they made our stay particularly special sharing their local knowledge and creating both a fun and relaxing environment. All of the staff spoke Arabic French and English fluently.    We'd like to say a huge thankyou again to Niako SouSou Sam and the rest of the entertainment team. They're exceptionally great at what they do and always full of energy and smiles.    Our room was gorgeous and cleaned regularly if we needed.    We were looked after daily by the bar staff. They were friendly remembered what we were drinking and we were always greeted with a smile in particular by Radouan.    The all inclusive food was nice and there was a fair variety on a daily basis.  Personally im a vegetarian and i found the options to be much better than i expected. The head chef was very accommodating to this requirement also.    The pool was relaxing and refreshing a perfect way to chill after being out in the hustle and bustle of the city.    Marrakech itself is a beautiful vibrant busy historical and cultural place that we'd love to visit again and would be keen to book Sol Oasis again.,Date of stay: September 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/358megf
Sol Oasis Marrakech,Tim F wrote a review Sep 2022,50,Amazing Entertainment Team,We visited as a couple having been to Marrakech on multiple occasions before but never to Sol Oasis. Hotel was very nice as expected from photos. Plenty beds good wifi and gym facilities. We loved the variety of food and looked forward to every meal and found the waiters in the restaurant to be very attentive. I also must give a special shout out to the Entertainment team they were friendly from day one and made sure we could join in with anything we wanted to and even encouraged us to do things we usually wouldn't have! Niako made me laugh every day and even convinced me to try my hand at archery by the end of the holiday and Sam did a great job of teaching me basis arabic. Animation team really made sure there was something for everyone whether you're young old or any ability... you certainly won't be bored! All staff at the hotel could not have been more helpful - from putting the football on in the bar to ensuring my girlfriend had someone quiet to sit for her online job interview.

Sol Oasis Marrakech,John Donagh wrote a review Sep 2022,50,An Amazing family holiday that we will not forget,We visited Sol Oasis Marrakesh at the end of August 2022.  It had been our first family sun holiday since pre Covid and our first time to Marrakesh.  We booked a Family Extra Suite and it was perfect King bed in main bedroom and a pull out Sofa Bed in living area which was very comfortable with a nice big bathroom terrace and balcony area also wardrobe safe coffee making facilities and 2 x air con units which keep the room at the perfect temperature.  House keeping called daily and changed bed linen and towels and room was cleaned to a very high standard. The hotel and grounds are kept in immaculate condition there are a couple of different bar areas but we mainly used bar area by pool as that was where all the entertainment was.  The All inclusive food selection was to a very good standard we have a couple of picky eaters and they were happy with selection for breakfast lunch and dinner. There is also an outdoor pizza and burger area which are available at lunch and evening time.  The staff were amazing from reception house keeping waiting bar staff and animation team all were so friendly and would go out of their way to make sure you were happy. Special mention to Hassan in dining area and all the animation crew SouSou ZiSou Russ Mike Sam Moss they absolutely made our holiday so much fun and gave us plenty of information on what to do and where to go in Marrakesh.  The staff are a credit to the Hotel and made for a truly memorable holiday.  We had great fun dancing and watching the fantastic shows that the team put so much effort into every second evening. There were also games during the day at the pool and around the area that you could easily join in with watch but were unintrusive if you just wanted to chill.    The location of the hotel is about 20 mins in a taxi outside the main area of Marrakesh we enjoyed this but the cost of a taxi in about €20 each way (approx.) The hotel did run a free shuttle bus but best to book in advance and also get your timing right you could end up having to get a taxi back if there was too much time between drop off and pick up.    We would most definitely visit Sol Oasis again due to the amazing vibe in the hotel and of course the world class animation team who really could not do enough for us. The people we met in Marrakesh were also extremely friendly and left us with very fond memories of Morrocco.,Date of stay: August 2022,,"Drogheda, Ireland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JDROI

Sol Oasis Marrakech,Leanne G wrote a review Sep 2022,40,"Great break, looking forward to coming back",We travelled to Sol Oasis on a 7-day getaway with the aim to have a relaxing holiday and explore Marrakesh; which we did - sort of.    The hotel itself is very “Instagrammable” with lovely architecture and lighting throughout but the real life of the hotel comes from the entertainment team - especially Mousse SouSou and Sam.    With games throughout the day we found ourselves leaving the hotel less than we intended to so we could stick around for water-sports the odd pool game and some of the activities on site.    We met some amazing people out there too who we plan to keep in touch with and come back to Sol Oasis for a reunion but until then here’s what we loved and we’d recommend…    WHAT WE LOVED…    - The people super friendly guests and hotel staff    - Water polo in the pool (and winning!)    - Number of guests  (not too many but enough to have a great atmosphere)    - Lunch time selection / snacks    - Bar-side drinks that allowed you to skip the queues    - Free shuttle bus service to the market / town    WHAT WE WOULD RECOMMEND…    - Late-opening for the pool / evening pool parties    - More outside entertainment in the evening    - More thorough clean of hotel rooms    - Later room towel collection    - Wider variety of pool games i.e. volleyball tournaments water obstacles etc.    - Later bar opening hours    - Raise awareness of cats roaming around the grounds (especially as my boyfriend is allergic to them!),Date of stay: September 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeeCGrant
Sol Oasis Marrakech,denice h wrote a review Sep 2022,40,Nice relaxing holiday,Just returned from a week at Sol Oasis. Had a lovely relaxing time. The grounds are spotless and great ambiance especially the live music at night. The food choice was extensive some of the desserts were amazing it was clear a lot of work and planning goes into the food preparation appearance and choice. The only thing we would of changed is that it was not always hot more warm however we did notice a microwave towards the end of the week which we probably could of used.  Special shout out to the entertainment staff who are really friendly and engaging however I think the unsung hero's are the waiting and the cleaning staff who work quietly behind the scenes making sure everything runs smoothly. Thanks to the bartender in the inside bar she is a lovely friendly person. Also the bartender/supervisor on the outside bar who works so hard making sure everyone gets their drinks and always has a smile on his face. I saw some negative reviews about the reception staff on TripAdvisor however our experience was that the reception staff were polite full of information and happy to make sure you had what you needed.  We had a day out in the souk - piece of advice don't take up the tour guide just make sure you know where you need to get back to and head for the tallest mosque don't be afraid to say 'no' to the traders some of their prices are outrageous.  Only slight disappointment was that I presumed when booking that all rooms had a balcony they don't and those that do look like quite small balconies however as the grounds are so lovely it wasn't a big deal. There were no tea or coffee making facilities in our room however you don't really need them and some rooms seem to have them.

Sol Oasis Marrakech,Natalie S wrote a review Sep 2022,40,A wonderful stay…. Thank you to the best team!,Stayed 18th Aug for 10 days. We had a great stay….    Firstly! The excellent!    The animation team… I’d read the reviews before we went but even then they exceeded expectations! They are the most amazing gang! We were stunned when we were called by our names on the first morning and the engagement was great with our son and always up for a chat and a laugh! Everyone was wonderful but special mention to our star Niako Sam Moose Russ! And many more names we’ve forgotten! (Sorry guys!) they all work so hard and make the hotel! We especially loved the Coba cabana and pool party! Such great fun!    Bar: lovely friendly staff! Mojitos we’re spot on! Occasional queues in afternoon could be easily solved by free vend in soft drinks for children…    Restaurant: self service restaurant tasty food and lot of choice- helpful staff. What lets it down is labelling whilst most of the main courses have labels there are no basic descriptions / ingredients. This is worse with the salad bar sadly no labelling at all. (We’ve previously stayed in a hotel with a simple app / QR code that provided daily menus- was really useful!)  Lunchtime BBQ’s are wonderful and our son was delighted with candy floss!    Room: we had the Sol basic room for 2 adults / 1 child. On check in we asked why there wasn’t a terrace (on website room images have terrace) I mentioned that the room with a pull out bed was very small and with no terrace restrictive. We ended up folding up the pull out bed over our 10 day stay as was not practical to move around the room at night with the bed out. In hindsight we should’ve booked the bigger room for 3. I was disappointed by receptions response- “all rooms are the same size” - no some have terraces!  Drying swimming gear / towels was an issue with no outdoor space saw a number of other rooms hanging towels and underwear on bushes outside their room!  That said the decor is really lovely super comfy beds and lovely linen! Amazing aircon! Housekeeping helpful and prompt (when reception remembered to pass on a message!)    Reception: mixed bag check in was great but didn’t want to deal with our room issues and communication wasn’t great during our stay. I suspect it’s because they were fully booked. It’s certainly an area for improvement in the hotel but wouldn’t stop us returning!    Pool : lovely depth whilst lively never over crowded great activities through the day but not intrusive if you want to relax! Life guard on duty!    The grounds are constantly being tended it’s a lovely resort with great layout not too big but enough for a lovely atmosphere!    The team make it! We had a wonderful holiday there are a few tweaks that could turn this from good to great!

Sol Oasis Marrakech,D N wrote a review Sep 2022,50,Best stay so far. Special Thanks to Zizu Sousou Khalid Russ Mike Niako Abdel Sam and Moose,Our best stay at any hotel. Very nice modern hotel. clean and tidy rooms with good shower and comfortable bed. Swimming pool is good and had no problem getting a sun lounger during the 2 week stay. Animation team are the best thing about this hotel. They are the most energetic exciting welcoming and fun that we’ve seen at any hotel they deserve a pay rise as they are the thing that separates this hotel from any others before. Personally I can’t see any other hotel beating it. There is good variety of shows activities and games during the day and always happy to sit down and talk for hours and even eat dinner with you and really do go the extra mile in helping you with everything you need in regards to any problems or queries in hotel (even more so than the reception team.) Special mention to the lifeguard team aswell and khalid for taking very good care of us over our stay. There is a good variety of food and drinks available The free shuttle transfer into marrakech is very good.    Overall 9.5/10 stay with only a few minor issue.    1. The holes in the swimming pole and the shards of tile at the bottom are dangerous    2. The reception team could be better at showing/telling you what and where everything is at the hotel but this was sorted for us by the animation team    3. Clean towels should be provided before u start getting ready at night but sometimes we didn’t get them till 8/9pm    Overall amazing stay and would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting morroco.

Sol Oasis Marrakech,lydiamilll wrote a review Sep 2022,40,A lovely holiday,What a beautiful hotel and fantastic animation staff with such talent. My partner and I thoroughly enjoyed our 10 day stay at Sol Oasis particularly down to Sam who I will mention a bit later.    My partner and I arrived at Sol Oasis at around 11:30am and were told that our room was delayed due to people checking out late… after reading another review that has said the same thing I am unsure now if this is true or if it’s just something the hotel says when they / the cleaners are running behind. Anyway - We were told the wait would be around an hour or two and this was fine - it gave us the chance to get some lunch from the buffet to look around the grounds and to have a little nap as we were tired from travelling. My partner asked reception again after around 2 hours and were told it was still not ready. We initially were told that we had an upgraded room so we were happy to wait for a bit longer. Fast forward around 5 hours time and the room is finally ready for us …. It is the same standard relatively small room - why did this take 5 hours to get ready? We had absolutely no issue in having a standard room and they are well decorated clean and sleek - but we did have a problem being told it was a VIP room for it to then be a standard room that took 5 hours to prepare for nothing more than a towel swan and some flower petals on the bed.    Now back to super Sam… From the very beginning Sam was welcoming entertaining and helpful. He is such an intelligent and informative man speaking fluently 4 languages and therefore able to engage with practically everyone who enters the hotel. Sam is so engaging and warm and encourages all guests to have a great time and immerse themselves in the local culture - he hosts Arabic lessons Moroccan tea workshops and a Turkish coffee one too - these were all fantastic and allowed us to meet and make friendships with other guests too. Sam is friendly and takes the time to learn things about the guests - he remembers your name where you are from and other things about you that make you feel really special and valued as a guest! Sam often sits with different guests of an evening and gets involved in your conversation so easily! What a great man and a pleasure to have met.    Enough about Sam as I could praise him all day!…    Other members of the animation team were quite flat in comparison to Sam… I couldn’t even tell you more than 2 of their names and there are 12 on the team. We found that some of the team approached my partner once at the beginning of our stay and that was it for the rest of the holiday but some of them still expected a review to be written praising them etc. e.g. one of the animation staff who I will not name approached me for the very first time on our last night and asked that I write a trip advisor review in front of her so that she could screenshot it and show her manager. Prior to this I wasn’t even aware of her name and had never spoken to her…. We also found that some staff members had a bit of a weird fascination with certain guests and buzzed around them like flies constantly (as in literally all day); ignoring everyone else.    The entertainment itself was fantastic and the staff were so full of life and energy - you can tell how much they enjoy their jobs and they are really good at what they do. There was a nice array of activities that you could take part in on site and I would definitely recommend getting involved.    The pool is lovely - a really decent size and nice depth. Clean water and a good amount of beds around. You can also bring your drink to the edge which is nice.    I am a cocktail lover and was so keen to try the substantial group of drinks that the hotel officers but was quite disappointed by the taste of many of them and by day 3 was drinking only Mojitos. The alcohol tasted quite funny in most of the cocktails and the cups were a little dirty on occasions with lipstick on them and grime. Unfortunately the sky bar / rooftop bar was not open throughout the duration of our stay and we would’ve loved to have experienced that.    My partner and I thoroughly enjoyed the food and as we are big foodies we were keen to try the local dishes. The tagines were our favourite! The flavours of the food were great and we enjoyed the selection of breads cold foods including salads and pastas and the hot foods that included different types of rices tagines vegetables etc. There were lots of food options but I would say not for the fussy eaters as there were not many plain/basic foods. In addition to this for some reason there was fish and meat etc chucked in to random dishes that didn’t need it. Chunks of ham in the coleslaw and calamari in the creamy pasta meant that many dishes wouldn’t have been suitable for vegetarians when they easily could have been. Also there was extremely limited to no allergen information next to the food so a lot of the time it was just guessing what you were eating - I would suggest if you have allergies to do some serious digging or avoid the food.    The cleaners are absolutely on it - we had fresh towels every single day even when we didn’t put them on the shower floor for washing. Not so environmentally friendly but definitely clean! Cleaners were also very helpful and polite.    We liked the free shuttle service to the main Marrakech area but be sure to avoid the people who greet you off the bus as they claim they work for the hotel and are there to guide you to the centre / souks but are ultimately looking to con you.    Marrakech city itself is unbelievable - a hustling bustling scene with monkeys and cobras in the square and an array of smells and colours.

Sol Oasis Marrakech,Barnyarmy1 wrote a review Sep 2022,50,Number One is Sam,"This was our second trip back to Sol Oasis in 3 months! What a brilliant experience we have had both times. Our first trip was as a family of 4 with a Family Suite beautiful spacious room which was perfectly maintained on a daily basis. The hotel itself was lovely and clean the food was incredible. We had a day trip out to the traditional souks which was a great experience. We met some interesting people and fell in love with Marrakech. The staff at the hotel were very helpful and incredibly nice. On arriving at the hotel we had our first encounter with the animation team Russ and Dounia  this was the beginning of our adventure. We were soon to meet the rest of the team what an amazing bunch of young people ..... excellent all round entertainment. Truly cannot fault these fun filled young people Sou Sou Mike Niako (Snoop dog) Abdel (dancing man) Pool guy ( Incredible Hulk) Super Sam the best and Moshine ( Mr Cocktails)  Sam is the Man! what an inspiring young man he is very talented all round excellent presenter ( going between 3 languages during presenting) Sam turned our holiday into a truly wonderful experience in fact so good we returned in August.  On our return we had three standard rooms with family joining us.  On arrival our room was slightly delayed no fault of the hotels it was late leavers however the Client Relationship team and Sam had that sorted in no time. Again what a guy he is! Our experience this time was again excellent. We booked through Trip Advisor and went on the day trip to the Atlas Mountains along with a waterfall visit lunch and camel ride. Sam came with us on the day trip it was a day of fun. The animation team are an inspiration for any hotel they really do keep everyone entertained sort any problems along with being super friendly. We have had the best time again! Surprise surprise we have booked again for part of the family to visit in December we cannot wait to see you all again  Totally agree with ""Sam is the best""",Date of stay: August 2022,,"Southend-on-Sea, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Barnyarmy1
Sol Oasis Marrakech,AdamEddie97 wrote a review Aug 2022,40,Summer of happiness!,Where do I begin with this hotel? I will begin like any good story at the beginning. We arrived at the beautiful ‘sol oasis’ at approximately 11.30 am on the 21st of august 2022 we climbed out of the taxi and was greeted by a very smiley and approachable security guard at the front gate who asked for me details and checked them off on his sheet quickly after this we was approached by a young fellow who took our suitcases from us so we didn’t have to walk with them which was a nice touch. We entered the beautifully decorated and clean and lovely smelling reception and made our way to the front desk where we spoke with a very stern and serious receptionist. He stated that as we was having a special room our room wasn’t quite ready yet we was fine with this and went for a wander around the grounds as unfortunately the reception staff didn’t provide us with much information about the hotel itself who we had to fend for ourselves in that sense until we found a useful map. Had some lunch and some drinks and then sat in the sofa section of the lobby… FAST FORWARD TO 5 HOURS and our room was finally ready again the nice fellow took our suitcases to the room for us which was again a nice touch. We entered our room to see that it was just a standard room (which was still lovely) and the only difference was that there was a swan made from towels on the bed it was lovely for them to do this however should it have taken 5 hours? Baring in mind we had been awake since 1am we wanted nothing more than to unpack and unwind.    We de-kitted our belongings and went to the pool for the afternoon which was lovely perfect depth not too deep and not too shallow my only criticism is there are a number of missing tiles in the pool which can seriously damage someone’s foot. The lifeguards were friendly and attentive and regularly did water aerobics. (LOTS OF CHILDREN BE AWARE)    The buffet restaurant was clean and well kept. The food was amazing all kinds of tagines and various other Moroccan delicacies my only concern is the lack of labelling there are no labels with ingredients displayed which can be difficult for people with allegories or tolerances. And secondly they like to chuck meat in random places (coleslaw rice etc) which again is an issue for vegetarians.    The room was cleaned daily with fresh towels which was lovely and the cleaners were very polite and helpful.    Now onto the entertainment/animation team… where to begin? I’ll save the best for last. On an evening there is usually a show performed by the animation team which is very good lots of skilled dancing and performances from Michael Jackson impressions to backflips to playing with fire. During the day the animation team encourage guests to take part in numerous games and activities darts archery volleyball football and lots of water games. My only issue with the some of the animation team is that they pick a guest and forget about everyone else… I guess it is fine and makes people feel more comfortable hopeful I noticed a slight trend that the male animation team became more inclined to spend time with females. Now onto the cherry on the cake the godsend the king himself Sam I having nothing but respect for this man. Remembers everyone’s names engages with EVERYONE very funny cheeky silly and remembers stories from conversations you have with him. Sam is a book of history and education teaching you all you need to know about marrakech the basic language how to make and enjoy Moroccan tea how to act in the souks and he’s a good dancer Sam is hands down a legend and deserves every bit of recognition he can get. If you visit be sure to hunt this fellow down.    Things to be aware of:  - pool towels are available but require a 100 MAD deposit per towel or whatever the equivalent in euros it may be.  - Do not use the on-site store as it’s very overpriced (£17 for a bottle of aftersun)  - Be sure to get involved and have fun!    Thank you SOL OASIS! It’s been great and I’ll be referring friends and family to this magnificent hotel.,Date of stay: August 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Southend-on-Sea, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AdamEddie97

Sol Oasis Marrakech,Kirandscott wrote a review Aug 2022,30,Good but busy,The hotel itself is very nice lovely grounds which are well kept. A small room but it had everything you needed - the balcony was very small and backed onto a muddy area which was odd.    The food was great a lovely choice and really tasty there was an issue with wasps however so that does need looking into. The drinks were great but the que for the bar not so great there is no waiter service as such as everyone was so busy.    No water in your room which can be a problem if you forget to grab some from the bar before it closes.    You need to be up at 7.30 to get a sun bed it was crazy how people were allowed to put towels out and then go off out for the day. The sun shades were broken so I felt sorry for the staff struggling to put them up!    The evening entertainment was great lovely animation staff and some great singers.    We asked for a late check out and we were happy to pay what ever the cost but the reception staff were not interested. They clearly had rooms available to book online so I’m unsure why they were making it so difficult and refused to accommodate our request. There is no where to shower so we ended up coming out of our room at 12 then flying at night with no rest or shower. We also asked to change money at reception and we’re told they didn’t have any.    Bus service is really good and needed as the hotel is in the middle of nowhere… it drops you off a fair way from the medina - dont go off with the guides just look for the tall mosque and you can find it yourselves.    Medina was fab as usual - always love the shopping and haggling.    We have been to Morocco several times and we did find the service lacking in this hotel - it could be that it was august and they were busy but maybe the owners need to hire more staff.    Unsure if we would return to this hotel as we found reception staff difficult and the fact the sun beds were hard to come by and we spent most our holiday sat next to the bar due to this.,Date of stay: August 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kirandscott
Sol Oasis Marrakech,dobbertravels wrote a review Aug 2022,50,Immaculate hotel with amazing staff and rooms,Lovely mid range hotel. Immaculate grounds super friendly staff. Literally support staff around all the time cleaning up tending to the gardens cooing over the toddler! Reception super friendly and organised a taxi to the airport for 250dhs. Food is lovely large choice of Moroccan foods at the buffet lots of fresh fruit and vegetables they also have a bbq on in the afternoon with burgers chips local food grilled chicken sardines etc. I note the previous review commenting on the lack of ice cream…..true the ice cream is only with dinner but the kids can get strawberry slushies any time of day which was even better! Special mention to sousou and zisou (sorry if not spelt right!) in the kids club. They are awesome with the kids and so kind and friendly with incredible face painting skills! The entertainment team was also wonderful super friendly and always smiling. We were amazed by the HUGE room I’m not sure if it was an upgrade but we had room 2301 which was right by the pool and bar so meant we could enjoy the evening entertainment from our terrace after the kids have gone to bed! (Also made it quite noisy which we didn’t mind….but if you did maybe ask for a room further back). Also free shuttle to Marrakesh is fab. Thank you sol oasis we will be back!

Sol Oasis Marrakech,Lewis1966 wrote a review Aug 2022,50,Outstanding Hotel and staff,Not too sure where to start but what a week myself and my partner had at the sol oasis Marrakech! Upon arrival we were met by friendly staff in reception who greeted us with a welcome drink whilst checking in. We were then shown to our room which was average size but more than enough space for two of us - it had a shower bathroom and a balcony. One tip would be there is a small window in the bathroom without a curtain/blind so cover this with a towel for privacy. The food and drink we couldn't complain...there was a pool bar which serves snacks (burgers etc) during the day and a frequent BBQ cooking fish and chicken which was perfect. Drinks wise there are plentiful ranging from local spirits and the beer is San Miguel in bottles (330ml). We took our own thermal cups which kept our drinks cool and saved having to use the plastic glasses around the pool.  The other reviews mention the entertainment staff a lot which I was pretty skeptical of since we usually don't tend to get involved in the games and entertainment during the day. However the reviews were right! The entertainment staff made our holiday one to remember they go out of their way to speak to you and generally enjoy a conversation and engaging with people. There were a few which stood out from the outset which we got on really well with and made our holiday constantly amusing with their humourous personalities - Russ SouSou Niako (Snoop!) And Mike. We even went into Marrakech with a couple of them for a few drinks which was great - it was a pleasure meeting them and we look forward to meeting up with them again.  Niako - hope the Gardner's fixed the hose pipe at archery lol!    Thanks again for a great week. Couldn't fault the hotel and the reviews are right the entertainment staff do make this hotel one to remember!!,Date of stay: August 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lewism967

Sol Oasis Marrakech,Ste wrote a review Aug 2022,30,Expected better,The hotel itself is nice. The staff are really friendly and helpful and the animation team are brilliant and work very hard.    The hotel has a lot of potential but the service was not quite what we expected and we felt it was advertised in the wrong way. We came here with high expectations and we were disappointed when we arrived. It really needs to state it only has one restaurant as this leaves guests disappointed. We were told other than the main buffet restaurant one was open but you have to pay for it (which is fine) but it was never open to serve food. I am not even sure why it says there are 3 as another isn’t even an option.    We stayed for 10 nights and it was pretty cheap overall so I guess you get what you pay for.    Pros  Very clean  Spacious and modern rooms  Nice bar area by reception  Housekeeping clean room everyday with fresh towels and very friendly  Hotel grounds are nice ( a little smaller than expected)  All of entertainment team are very good.  Shuttle bus is good and the driver is great  Staff overall are friendly and helpful    Cons  IT DOES NOT HAVE 3 RESTAURANTS! One of the reasons we booked the hotel because it advertises 3 restaurants. It has one large buffet room. The 2 other so called restaurants are not restaurants. At best one is a late night bar that serves drinks you have to pay for. I seen this open once in the 10 days I stayed here and it opened at 11pm. The other room next to it is basically to drink morrocan tea for an hour in the afternoon with a very polite host.    The food is average at best and repetitive.    The late breakfast snacks and the afternoon snacks are the same everyday. Breakfast snacks are pastries and afternoon are meat wrapped in crepes and more pastries and sometimes pizza and candy floss for the kids.    We had to ask to moved rooms as the entrainment was too loud and we have a one year old.    The sky bar is never open    Make sure you book the shuttle bus a few days in advance as it does get full and the taxis are not cheap - about £22 each way.    As a family hotel with lots of children I found it very bizarre that you do not get free ice cream for all inclusive. I was charged £4 for a magnum in the shop. The only time Ice cream is available is at the evening meal and you have the option of vanilla or a chocolate scoop in a bowl.    The cocktails are bad and poor quality    Not much service around the pool area    The pool party on Saturday night is really loud. Especially when you have a 1 year old in bed. We were far back aswell so can’t imagine what it’s like by the pool.    Overall I wish I did more research and paid a little bit more to stay in a better hotel as this hotel isn’t really for me but I can see how families with kids love it. It is very energetic with a lot going on and the entertainment team are very good. If my daughter was a little older she would of loved it. I wouldn’t say this is a peaceful hotel at all.,Date of stay: August 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/876stel

Sol Oasis Marrakech,Libbie Watson wrote a review Aug 2022,50,Best holiday !!,Firstly me and my partner would like to say thank you to all the staff who made our first trip to Morocco so memorable!    Entertainment- 10/10. From day to night they went out of their way to ensure you were happy if you needed anything and they would always make sure to pack your day full of activities and put a show on for you at night. They really did make us feel so welcome from the get go we will miss our late night chase the ace card games! Hopefully the next couple who represent UK in the couples game can hold the title for us 🤣    Bar staff- Amazing! They all pretty much remembered our orders off by heart (and realised me and my boyfriend are big drinkers!) thank you so much for always smiling and laughing with us!    Food- 10/10 as someone who is a fussy eater there was so much food to offer so there was never a problem of not eating! The many different tajine’s are beautiful and the fresh bread was soo good!!!    We also would like to thank the cleaning staff as our rooms hotel grounds restaurant etc was always spotless!    Overall we couldn’t fault the hotel and it made for the best couples holiday! The hotel is a little out of the way from the centre but the hotel provides a free shuttle which we would highly recommend using:)    Tips : ask for love on the beach with melon vodka!

There was always something to do with the entertainment team. They were so warm fun and they made the whole holiday experience one that I won't forget. The evening entertainment was brilliant especially the dance shows that everyone could enjoy.  The room was a perfect size and it was always clean.  The food was lovely with lots of choices although sometimes the tables took a while to be cleaned up and re-laid so it looked a little messy at times.  We went to the market and on a camel ride organised by the hotel which was an amazing experience and I would definitely recommend it.

They took time out to have lunch and dinner with us…again they made our holiday what it was … fantastic !!!

Sol Oasis Marrakech,Elliot R wrote a review Aug 2022,30,"A few pros, lots of cons. Room for improvement but not a complete write off..",So this is our 2nd visit to Marrakech 1st to the Sol Oasis by Melia.  I’m going to list the pros and the cons  I’ll start with the PROS    1. The entertainment team is fantastic Sam Nioki Russ Medhi (Michael Jackson) and Zizou are all fantastic. Sam seems to be the “leader” and his interaction with the guests of all cultures is amazing fluent in a number of languages and funny with it as well he makes you feel included and made the holiday very enjoyable. As did the other reps as well.  2. The snack bar was fantastic offering daily snacks of Cheeseburgers Shwarma Salad bar stone baked pizza there really was a great variety of choice.  3. Cleanliness of rooms (I need to stress this is about the rooms only this will become clear in the negatives)  The housekeeping staff here are very thorough kind polite staff changing towels daily making the beds cleaning the floors. Everyday the rooms smelt fresh and clean I can’t fault their effort and attention to detail.    Now to the CONS.    1. Cleanliness of the drinks glass/plastic cups etc.  Everyday we had a drink and the glassware (sometimes plastic depending on where you’re sitting) was filthy. When I addressed this I was assured they were clean and they were just scratches on the glass/plastic. This wasn’t the case I took one of the cups back to my room and wiped it myself and the what was left on the towel was a disgusting yellow grease like residue. It was seriously gross.  2. Drinks.  They literally give you any drink. I asked for rum and coke instead of telling me they’d run out of rum they just poured gin instead. When I challenged they said I was wrong. During the entire week I don’t think I drank the same drink twice. They just literally make the cocktails up as they go along.  I assume that their could be an issue with allergies etc if you’re not getting what you asked for and are unassumingly served something you didn’t want. This needs addressing. There doesn’t seem to be any management of the bar staff.  That being said the majority of them were all polite and friendly but they all flat out lied about what they were serving you. Speaking to numerous other couples and families this happened to everyone.  3. The a la carte restaurant.  This for us was a USP for the hotel. Somewhere you could break away from the normal all inclusive buffet and have a special meal don’t mind paying at all for that nice 3 course Spanish themed menu that was advertised when we booked.  We asked at reception when it was open. Every night we were told.  Of the 7 nights we stayed it didn’t open once. Admittedly after the 1st 2nd and 3rd night and each of those being told it would be “open tomorrow from 7pm” and it not being we gave up asking. Again talking to other families they had the same experience. It just seems a big waste of income for the hotel and a reason alienate and frustrate guests.  Average meal on the a la carte was 80-120 Dirhams. So potentially 400D per couple not including drinks. Why advertise it if they’re not going to open it. Or at least be honest and say it’s not open. Very disappointed.  4. “Skybar”  We saw on trip advisor that the Skybar was an excellent addition to Sol Oasis a premium bar that was outside the normal all inclusive allowance but offered a calmer chilled experience. It never opened. Not on any night..  5. Extras..  We often wanted to buy a can of coke for the room or a Fanta lemon etc. none of the 2 bars had a till so they couldn’t change the notes for you. It was like you were asking for the world. You’d think they’d want people to buy drinks as that’s outside the all inclusive so the mark up must be high and profitable. No not this place.    All in all Sol Oasis is not a complete write off. Everything I’ve stated that’s negative can be improved on. If they’re aiming to be anything like the Iberostar then they have to improve. But the place does have everything it needs to be success the grounds are beautiful the staff are willing. The entertainment staff are literally the body and soul of the venue and they lucky to have such good people.  Table service would be a welcome touch. The food at lunch time and breakfast is good can get a bit repetitive but the standard is good. Breakfast could be better.  I would love to come back in 2 years time and experience a better Sol Oasis.,Date of stay: August 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Sheffield, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Elliot0412
Sol Oasis Marrakech,Lee C wrote a review Aug 2022,50,Good hotel made excellent by entertainment staff,We have just returned from a five night staff at the Sol Oasis and had a truly amazing time.    The hotel is nice weather was excellent food was good sports facilities brilliant rooms were comfortable and drinks were cold and refreshing.    However this hotel goes from good to excellent due to the amazing entertainment staff. The activities during the day were brilliant the event staff always full of energy always friendly and quality of the night time shows was fantastic. This was topped off by a pool party on our last night which could have been Ibiza!    Niako Mido Russ Sam Ben and SouSou deserve huge credit for making our stay extra special.    Free shuttle bus into Marrakech was a nice touch too and well worth saving the £15-£20 each way taxi ride.    We were travelling as a couple with one child and would recommend for families.    Only negative comments I would make are the poor quality of cocktails (especially compared to insta and Facebook photos) the lack of an ice cream station for the kids and the slightly early bar closing time of 11pm.    However the positives far outweigh these few negatives and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would certainly return.,Date of stay: July 2022,,"York, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/881leec

Sol Oasis Marrakech,Jack T wrote a review Jul 2022,50,THE BEST HOLIDAY,My partner (Eilidh) and I had the most amazing holiday. Had to be one of the best (if not the best) holiday we’ve both been on. The food was amazing and the rooms were nice and very well air conditioned which was essential in the heat. The place was kept immaculately clean from the outdoors to the reception to the restaurant to each room. Every member of staff we encountered were lovely and went out their way to making sure we had a great time.    Special shout-out to the entertainment team. They made it feel like we were on a holiday with your friends. Have never experienced a team like it. My partner and I feel like we’ve made some very good friends and we hope to stay in touch with them in the future. As well as their kindness every one of them had genuine talent which was evident in the night time entertainment. They also made sure there were plenty of varied activities to do during the day. We’ll miss them but already planning our next visit so hopefully will see them all again soon!    Lastly during this holiday I unfortunately hit my head which caused an injury that had to be seen to. I mention this as the staff that dealt with it were very caring and efficient. Within 20 minutes of this happening; they’d assessed the cut called a doctor had a taxi called to the hotel and I was sorted in no time. The speed of this was extremely impressive and I’m grateful to said staff that dealt with the situation.    I can’t recommend this hotel enough!

Sol Oasis Marrakech,Paul R wrote a review Jul 2022,50,Amazing Holiday,We stayed at the Sol Oasis July 22 for seven nights.  Our flight was delayed so we didn’t arrive until after midnight normally you are greeted at reception upon arrival with a glass of sparkling to get your holiday started.  The hotel rooms are a reasonable size quaint and clean with traditional Moroccan style decor. Towels are replaced each day when the rooms are cleaned.  The on-site facilities are very good. The pool is a good size and surrounded by gardens the bar isn’t far from the pool. The hotel also has a football pitch tennis volleyball courts and archery area. All areas are well kept and cleaned regularly.  Sol Oasis has everything that you could possibly hope for but the best thing is definitely the staff. All staff are extremely friendly which creates an amazing atmosphere.  The food is brilliant with lots of choice first all inclusive holiday that I’ve been able to choose healthy meals.  The entertainment team are on another level to anything we’ve experienced. A lot of effort goes into the night-time shows to ensure everyone enjoys themselves we read lots of reviews before choosing Sol Oasis but were still surprised at how good it was.  Special thanks to Niaka Russ Sam Michael and Zizou who made our stay very special.  We will definitely visit you again 😊,Date of stay: July 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C6821ZTpaulr
Sol Oasis Marrakech,Jasmin wrote a review Jul 2022,50,Great 4 day stay at Sol Oasis,We stayed at this lovely hotel between 8th-12th july during Eid.  Can I just start by saying all the other reviews were right in saying the staff are amazing at this hotel. So friendly and very welcoming. The grounds are stunning and the hotel gives a very modern but traditional Moroccan vibe.    Rooms- we stayed in room 2402 (family xtra suite).Very spacious modern and the beds were comfortable. We had 1 large double bed and a sofa bed. All rooms are situated close to the pool areas.    Food - food was very fresh and tasty. there was always something different to eat everyday. There was a mix of many different Foods such as Tagines lasagna pizza roast chicken kofte etc. they also had a snack place outside which we would usually eat at around 4pm which was nice however I was quite disappointed to see that once they had ran out of the mini pizza slices they wouldn’t re stock again so once they were gone they were gone basically! For an all inclusive hotel I did expect the pizzas to be re filled if was empty. Other than that I can’t fault the food/drinks. They had lovely mock tails too.    Kids club- kids club was one of the best kids club we had seen in terms of how great the girls are there with the children!! We had a 3 year old with us and she absolutely loved going to the club everyday. Special shout out to Susu Zisou and Waheba…they really do go the extra mile and are always so so happy and bubbly. We felt comfortable to leave our 3 year old with them where as we normally don’t leave her in kids clubs abroad and venture about but these girls made us feel so at ease. They truly are amazing at their jobs and they deserve all the recognition they can get. Well done girls and we miss you all!    Entertainment- again entertainment was amazing. There was always something different going on at night. There was shows in the amphitheatre as well as live singers and shows outside by the bar area. On Eid night There was a special show which was really nice and they had lit up lovely fireworks around the pool (I’ll attach some pics). Shoutout to the entertainment guys Michael and the other few boys I’ve forgotten their names but they all were very friendly and great to chat to.    Location- we booked our private transfer through Hoppa.com. Transfer time to the hotel from Marrakech airport is around 25-35mins. This hotel is located on the outskirts and there’s not much to see nearby however the hotel does offer a free return shuttle service everyday into city centre which is great. I believe they run it at 3-4 times a day.    I would definitely say I would return back here but just not in July as temperatures are scorching. It was almost 45 degrees everyday whilst we was there!    Well done SOL OASIS your hotel is fantastic!  We hope to be back very soon :),Date of stay: July 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jasminna123

Sol Oasis Marrakech,Francesca H wrote a review Jul 2022,40,Still a good holiday!!,Overall a very good holiday! The grounds of the hotel are beautiful and the rooms are also of a very good standard! The food was great with lots of variety. Pool area was lovely never struggled to get a sun bed! The entertainment team were always friendly and encouraged you to get involved! I enjoyed my daily water aerobics!    The one downfall for us was the noise when trying to sleep! The rooms are not sound proof at all so if anyone walks past your window it is super loud! We were also in a ground floor room so the noise of the people in the room above us kept us awake sometimes.    Would still recommend and return if we were to visits Marrakesh again however next time we would ask for an upstairs room! We would also visit outside June - august as we soon realised July was too hot for us with highs of 48 degrees!,Date of stay: July 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/929francescah

The room had plenty of amenities including 2 TVs safe mini fridge and tea and coffee facilities. the housekeeping was kept to a great standard. Beautiful live music during the early evenings. Bar staff very friendly and great service. There is also a regular free shuttle bus which takes you direct to the markets.    The highlight of the hotel is the entertainment team. The team put on great shows and evening entertainment such as bingo & dances. There are also different activities including darts pool games water aerobics & archery.

Sol Oasis Marrakech,Natalie S wrote a review Jul 2022,50,Brilliant Hotel just outside hustle and bustle of Marrakech! Absolute Oasis!,We've just got back from a 7-day trip to Marrakech and we stayed at the Sol Oasis Marrakech and absolutely adored it! The staff are truly what makes this hotel what it is - they have an entertainment team of approx. 12 that are always on hand to make your experience great. Whilst there we did Aqua Aerobics Darts Archery - and many more activities available!    The rooms are lovely and clean - pillows and beds are VERY comfy and the shower is brilliant. Room Service came everyday to refill towels/toilet roll which is a nice touch. Lovely big toiletries in the bathroom so no shortage there! Basic TV but does have few english news channels. Air con was brilliant especially as it was 38 degrees when we were there! Also great fridge in room. One downside was for two people there wasn't a lot of storage space in wardrobe for hanging clothes.    The gardens around the hotel are extremely beautiful and were being groomed every morning! Few cute little cats around site 3/4 - but not needy and very well fed! Pool is absolutely stunning - when we went in the weekday it was very quiet - however does pack out at the weekends. However sunbeds are very easily found and your never short of options - so no need to grab one early! And the sunbeds and umbrellas are of very high quality.    Food wise it was stunning! Always had traditional tagines out for Lunch and Dinner - which were DELICIOUS. But also had more classic options like Paella Burgers Fish Lasagne etc so everyone was happy! Lovely pastries and fresh orange juice in the morning with a range of cereals crepes and pancakes. Best wine I've had at an all inclusive hotel especially the rose and white - and lots of it! Only downside was the lack of good coffee the coffee in the machines weren't great - so that could be one improvement - but always did have Mint Tea on hand as well! Absolutely amazing desserts at Lunch and Dinner and lots of yummy juices for breakfast.    There's one bar near the pool which did often have quite a few queues - so more staff on the weekend would help when busier. Absolutely amazing list of included cocktails that were delightful especially the mojito! However if you do enjoy premium spirits although you can buy them (approx. 40-50 dh) the bar weirdly doesn't seem to have a cash register so can't always provide change straight away - so had to ask them a few times. So again that would be an improvement! But bar staff were all so delightful and very quick to serve!    Staff on reception were lovely. Bit of tax to pay on check in (approx £23 for 7 nights) - brilliant shuttle bus that runs 6 times a day. The reception space is absolutely delightful and so peaceful. Very well kept! Lots of sitting space across the grounds and very disabled friendly with lots of ramps! I went to the gym on site 2/3 times and lots of nice modern equipment however wasn't any air-con so that could be one slight improvement. Also brilliant sites for volleyball tennis and badmington!    As mentioned previously - the staff are just incredible! Big shout out to Sam Niako Russ Sousou Zisou Michael. Also the bar and waiting staff Soufane Mehdi and Machino were all amazing - they were always happy to help and there with a smile! Lots to do if you have kids and lots of activities for the adults to join in on including making Mint Tea Learning Arabic Bellydancing - and lots more! My only one improvement would be that sometimes I turned up to classes eg Yoga TRX - to see they weren't on or member of staff were off - so maybe an updated daily schedule of whats on on the board near the pool would be great? But whats on offer is incredible including Yoga TRX Spin Aqua Aerobics Volleyball Water Polo etc. So much to do!  The evening entertainment was also great with Latin Night Oriental Night Moroccan Night all with 30-40 dance routines - incredible! Other nights included Just Dance Night Bingo and Karoake.    One slight improvement was that on checkout we handed in our bags - and I don't believe they have luggage storage so bags were left in the lobby until collection (4 hrs) and they also don't have a shower room - which would be appreciated if your leaving for the airport later and want a shower after the pool. And there could be more hand sanitizing stations across site.    All in all absolutely brilliant stay would definitely come back and THANK YOU SOL OASIS FOR AN AMAZING HOLIDAY!,Date of stay: June 2022,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/natalies270

Sol Oasis Marrakech,DAllan29 wrote a review Jul 2022,50,Choukran,Cracking hotel. At an all-inclusive hotel there is so much to get right every day – and Sol Oasis does almost everything really well.    Everything within the complex is new high quality and immaculately maintained and presented - pools and loungers sports pitches/gym nice restaurant bars and patios. Plenty of activities in the day and cool chilled out live guitar music every night before the entertainment.    Staff are amazing. The staff at the bar in the restaurant and the activities/entertainment team were all such genuinely nice people who take pride in doing a great job. Property gardening housekeeping etc also all very pleasant. Too many people to shout out here really… but Mohcine and Hicham at the bar Jamal in the restaurant Abdel Sam and SouSou on the entertainment team plus so many more.    Food was generally excellent and varied including traditional Moroccan cuisine healthy stuff pasta/grill/omelette stations. Some things can be a little cold as occasionally happens at a buffet but overall this is very good food for an all-inclusive. Wide range of drinks/cocktails and the bar staff are helpful and decent banter.    Shuttle to Marrakech is an excellent perk. Wi-Fi works pretty well all over the grounds.    Only average experience was reception – pretty uninformative and we had to go back a couple of times including once for a weird towel deposit system which should have been mentioned. Also we paid for late checkout and then they deactivated the key cards early which was annoying having made the point about paying.    Overall though a great hotel at what is a very reasonable price – you won’t regret choosing it.,Date of stay: June 2022,,Grand Cayman,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DAllan29

Sol Oasis Marrakech,David Blake wrote a review Jun 2022,50,A lovely hotel with great staff!,A very nice hotel on the outskirts of Marrekesh with lovely grounds. The room was spacious and clean with a Berber twist. Food was excellent quality and varied throughout the week.    We agree with previous reviews that the staff make this hotel. The animation team were great and the evening entertainment was very professional. The shows in the theatre were a highlight. A particular mention goes to Hicham in the restaurant who was there with a smile every night and magically appeared to top up our glasses.    Wi-fi was the best we've experienced in a hotel being able to stream movies in HD without issue. The courtesy bus into the city centre was invaluable.    We did have a couple of minor issues with the room on arrival mainly low water pressure in the shower and a wobbly toilet. However we only had to mention these and they were quickly rectified which shows good customer service.    All the bars close at 23.00 which we felt was very early...people are on their vaccination! This was particularly annoying when the private parties went on until the early hours and drinks were still being served to them. Perhaps keep the lobby bar open later?    However these are minor things for what was a great break at a great price.    Top tips - Join Melia Rewards before making the booking then book directly via their website for a discounted price. You can then use your 2000 welcome points to get it even cheaper.    At Marrakech airport on the way home you still need to go to the check in desk to get a boarding stamp even if you have no baggage and have already checked in online.

Sol Oasis Marrakech,Carol D wrote a review Jun 2022,50,Brilliant,Had a brilliant time.Cannot fault the hotel from decor to clendliness.All the staff was very kind and polite.very nice swimming pool we was there in may and the pool was warm enough to swim.The food and drink was to a very good standard the beer was bottled Sam Miguel and my friends enjoyed the rose wine.  The reason for picking this hotel was because of all the good reviews especially about the animation team especially sousou she was outstanding (she made a big impression on myself my husband Alan and my friends Claire and Dave). They all made themselves known to the guest's and all made you feel welcome.  The evening entertainment was very good.

There was entertainment every night which was always really good fun (especially the bingo!) and all the activities in the day such as darts and aquaerobics were great!

Sol Oasis Marrakech,PaulaNathan wrote a review Jun 2022,50,Wonderful family holiday,The hotel decor and surroundings are beautiful and spotlessly clean. All the staff made everything perfect for our stay. The food was fresh and delicious with a good amount of choice. The pool area was always clean and tidy and the lifeguards can’t do enough to help. The only criticism is we would have liked more background music during the day. Even though it’s a very relaxing environment at times we could just hear children crying.  The kids club was brilliant - Sou sou & Zizou are most definitely the 2nd mums of all the kids and the kids pool area was alot of fun. The animation team made our holiday such wonderful & incredibly hardworking people. We loved their continuous interaction with us and all of the evening entertainment.  We all had a fantastic holiday and we will definitely be returning as soon as we can.,Date of stay: June 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaulaNathan
Sol Oasis Marrakech,Elias Zendah wrote a review Jun 2022,50,Breathtaking place,I’ve had the pleasure to stay there on 02 occasions last year  last time was in august 21.  On one of those I was there with my wife 02 kids and mother-in-law. ( 02 rooms obviously).    I’ve stayed in 100s of hotels in many Resorts around the world ( for work and also holidays ) and I can tell you this one is a unique place…… in the middle of an oasis ( sunset time / Sunrise also you can take some beautiful pictures)  very peaceful atmosphere very relaxing sublime swimming pool the restaurant ( the buffet one ) got so much variety breakfast lunch and dinner.    The Team members were passionate about service they genuinely want you to have some unforgettable moments there all of them  management Team Members seriously All.    They remembered our names from day one  my kids were treated as if they were King and Queen particularly in the mini club evening shows were also great still watch the videos with the kids from time to time.    Gym was great  got everything.  WiFi was fairly good.  Bottled beer ( for All in This is a treat) Mojitos with the freshest mint that you could ever have wine ( I drink only red ) was good snacks in the afternoon were pretty Good as well the Panini cakes etc…. NosNos coffee ( a must if you like coffee) better than in Carré Eden in Marrakech city centre ( honestly).    Not going to be able to go this year due to some work commitments but definitely will do my best to be there December 22 with the family.    Forgot to mention that there is a shuttle bus to The Medina and back.

All the reviews here speak for themselves it was everything we had expected and even better.    The entertainment crew are fantastic special mentions to Sam Sousou Russ and of course Michael and his moonwalk.    The food and beverage team are great special mention to Morshine and his amazing cocktails at the pool bar. All the F&B team make you feel welcome Abdelilah in the restaurant made us such a difference.    The rooms are great the pool is fantastic and you don’t have leave the resort if you don’t need to.

Sol Oasis Marrakech,NosandNoo wrote a review Jun 2022,50,Perfect half term get away,Oasis perfectly describes this hotel. The surrounding area is dry and dusty but the moment you walk through the huge doors you are greeted by a calm tropical oasis. Our room was just right for a family of 4 (room 2621). The pool and the amount of activities on offer from tennis archery pickle ball aqua aerobics - there is enough to keep everyone or all ages entertained. The gym is state of the art free weights running machines and even a TRX room and yoga classes. The food was amazing the salads to die for it was very easy to eat really healthily on this holiday. The highlight for us though was the staff whether it was the bar staff with their friendly greetings the waiters and waitresses with their attention to detail they kept topping up our wine or the outstanding entertaining staff who managed to remember your name include you in lots of activities but still allow you to enjoy relaxing around the pool. A special shout out goes to Sam Russ Sousou Niako (Archery expert I dare you to beat him!) and recently arrived Abdel. The waiters Abdul Hishel Jalal and Rudaoun were exceptional. My only criticism would be the website does not adequately reflect the amazingness of the hotel!,Date of stay: May 2022,,"Berkhamsted, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NosandNoo

We had everything we needed in the hotel. Nice gym classes and activities on every day. Tennis courts basketball court football archery TRX yoga and water aerobics on the premises. Food was lovely with plenty of choice to suit everyone. Pool area is great with seats/umbrella always available. Indoor heated pool also available. Bus available to bring you into the city.  The staff at Sol Oasis are very warm and welcoming. Everything is run very efficiently. Bar staff always greeted us with warm smiles and great service. Arthur from the management team was lovely and always had time to chat to guests. The animation team are exceptional. They are a multi-skilled impressive group that will keep you entertained with great performances every night. They are also very interesting and charismatic people who you will enjoying talking to. The animation team are full of energy and so much fun to be around. I want to say a special thank you to Sou Sou who looked after us all week and had me laughing every day. A real superstar!!

Sol Oasis Marrakech,Geraintevans69 wrote a review May 2022,50,Relaxing and great fun at the same time...,The resort is just a 25 minute ride from the airport and the hotel and grounds are welcoming and very well kept. Our initial experience was good with a smooth check-in and our room was clean and well located although the balcony is small and not somewhere that you would spend much time. The food is very good although the resort would benefit from having an alternative location / menu on-site to mix things up. Best thing for us though are the people bar staff Morcene and Rida but the animation team really made our stay very special..... Sousou Zisou Russ-E-Boy and the undeniably talented Sam.

Great bar staff especially Machino ensuring we never waited for a drink.  Food was varied and tasty always something new to try but so much choice you’d need a month to get through it.  Things for the children including pizza burgers and pasta station  fresh grill.

Sol Oasis Marrakech,youjoeyou wrote a review May 2022,50,The staff really make this place amazing,First of all I need to do a shout out to everyone on the kitchen team - the food and staff are so amazing. We planned to have some dinners out but liked the food so much we stayed.    Special shout out to the restaurant staff especially Abdelilah and Said (they were amazing). In terms of the wait staff Soufane and Mehdi were so great too. I hope the management will speak to them to thank them for their work!    The animation team had so much energy and made you feel like you were at home. I enjoyed archery with Niako bellydancing with Nani and I loved the bollywood night in the theatre. Sam Zizou James Michael and Nouf also took the time to get to know us and make us feel at home.    Maybe the rooms weren’t cleaned the greatest but the staff and food made up for it.

Sol Oasis Marrakech,Adina wrote a review May 2022,50,A perfect place for a great holiday,Me&my friend stayed at Sol Oasis 29/04-03/05 (all inclusive). Everything was amazing about this hotel. We were checked in early and served some refreshing beverages upon arrival. It is not located centrally and it can be quite costly to get to the town centre to visit but the staff will always help with travel recommendations and they also have a free shuttle service to the town centre twice a day.    The food is nice we always found something to our taste and we got to try the local cuisine too. It is true we did not make it a must for us to have exquisite food so it was easy for us to be pleased by the menu.    The room was really nice and so was the room service. We had a room with a little balcony 3 min walk from the restaurant and swimming pool and although it was quite close to the entertainment area it wasn't impossible to get some rest. Also the entertainment programmes end at 11pm and they are quite enjoyable so worth staying up late a couple of nights.    We managed to stay at the hotel whilst the Ramandan was coming to an end so a lot of locals were staying as guests to celebrate. It was a lucky and amazing immerssion in the Muslim traditions and the Moroccan culture associated to this very special time.    It is a great place for families and couples. You can enjoy both quiet moments and the activities the crew prepares for the children/adults. Evenings are lovely and the staff do an amazing job entertaining the guests.    A great shout out to the team who made us feel really welcomed. Everyone there does a great job and the management should know they are all assets to this business.

Sol Oasis Marrakech,loopylu1000 wrote a review Apr 2022,50,Excellent - friendly - clean,I will start with just a couple of negatives. I booked a family xtra room and emailed reservations asking for a twin room with an additional single bed I received confirmation from Mohamed that my request had been noted. On arrival we had a double bed with a sofa bed I don’t like to complain so we had to deal with this it didn’t feel like a good start. The food was amazing but there were lots of flies on everything I feel that they should have more protection over the food especially in the warmer months it did affect our choice of pastries as the stickiest were covered worse. On to the positives - amazing!!!!!! The entertainment staff were the best I’d ever seen their dedication to making everyone happy was outstanding! The bar staff waiters and chefs were all so approachable and attentive. The cleaners and gardeners were on the go all day. Every single person says hello as you pass them. The hotel was spotless the rooms were spotless the pool and sun beds were kept organised. The food was fantastic lots of choices at every meal and kept very hot the wine was good the bar selection was good. I can’t remember everyone’s name to thank them and we didn’t get a chance to say goodbye but I thank them all for making our stay truly memorable. If you want peace and tranquility in the desert then this is the place for you. Not luxurious but very comfortable and super clean.

The entertainment team (Zizou Sousou Russ Michael Sam Nani and Niako Dounia the best choreography) always go the extra mile to make us smile every single day. Both Zizou and Sousou looked after our children as if they were their own. It's meant me and Jim could relax and enjoy being together which is rare on a family holiday!

Sol Oasis Marrakech,David B wrote a review Apr 2022,50,Amazing hotel made even better by its amazing team!!,What a fabulous hotel made magical by its amazing team!! We hadn’t visited Marrakesh or even Morocco before and really didn’t know what to expect especially as it was April and still had Covid 19 measures to comply with to gain entry. We were so pleasantly surprised from the moment we arrived. We are a family or four with two girls (12 and 8) and had the best time.    From the minute we arrived we were treat as VIP Guests with Taofique the bar man beginning the experience learning our names and not forgetting them throughout the break. He waved and said hello each morning and kept us well stocked with drinks going over and above. What an amazing guy.    Following the seamless shift change we met Mocene who made us feel so special throughout the holiday ensuring everyone treat us well and he gave amazing service with a beaming smile everyday.    Both Taofique and Mocene were really great and specials chaps who we won’t forget.    Then there is the entertainment team who are quite simply the most energetic friendly engaging special group of people. They are a well oiled machine who work so so hard to keep the guests entertained with fun activities games shows etc. they understand not everyone wants to be involved and respect everyone’s wishes but my experience tells me that the more you get involved the more you will enjoy the time there.    The entire team is amazing but we must give a special mention to Sam Russ Zizu and Sissu (forgive me if I have any spellings incorrect). These are indeed special people who made us feel like we were VIP guests. Sam and Russ took time to talk to us about their culture and life in Morocco which is something we will never forget and will stay with us. They are deeply dedicated to their work and interaction with their guests it has been the best experience.    I do hope their manager reads this review and I would like them to know how much their hard work and effort has made our stay a special time.    On the hotel itself it is beautiful there is a real mix of food and drink to select from that stops you from becoming board of the same food and drink. Throughout the day the restaurant or snack bar is generally open to get some food if you want it.    The hotel rooms are really nice and spacious. Throughout the stay we noticed how many staff were at hand to keep the hotel clean maintained landscaped sub beds and parasols positioned for guests.    All in all this is an excellent and well ran hotel which is testament to its amazing staff.    It would be our pleasure to visit again some time soon and we can only hope the same people will be there!!

Sol Oasis Marrakech,Julie L wrote a review Apr 2022,50,Fantastic!,We spent a week here as a family of four (kids aged 12&14) this April. The Sol Oasis is a stunning hotel in beautiful grounds. The rooms were lovely. We had two rooms which joined via a shared balcony which were perfect for our family.  The staff here work so hard to ensure your stay is perfect and they are all so friendly and kind. Nothing is too much trouble in all departments. If you want to be entertained the animation team are fantastic but equally if you would rather be left in peace that is respected too. All staff seem to work such long hours but they are always so cheerful.  There are lots of opportunities for sports and activities. I wish I had taken my sports gear with me!  The restaurant food was superb. Loads of choice at every meal. Always lovely Moroccan dishes but also a pasta bar salad bar chips and pizzas a grill and many other dishes along with afternoon goodies at the snack bar!  There is a shuttle bus into and from Marrakesh city at various times of the day too which was brilliant.  Thank you to all staff at Sol Oasis for a really wonderful holiday.

We arrived very late as our flight was delayed and the hotel were expecting us and had food ready on arrival. Ilyas the concierge was very helpful. Free shuttle from the hotel to the heart of Marrakesh and back.  Food was amazing from breakfast to the evening meal lots of variety. Very clean hotel abs lovely spacious rooms.

Sol Oasis Marrakech,DeliciousMarbella wrote a review Mar 2022,50,The best choice.,Had the most amazing holiday at the Sol Oasis. It's a really well run hotel in truly beautiful and impressive grounds. The rooms are all totally renovated and immaculate.. What we particularly liked was the fact the buildings are only two storey so it's more like living in a small village with lots of stunning courtyards and fountains. We were lucky to stay for 4 weeks(basically chosen by the high trip advisor rating) Absolutely no complaints and the weather was perfect most days around 25 degrees. The food was always varied lots of opportunities to try Morrocan dishes as well as international.. Have to mention the cakes and pastries.. They were unbelievable..  The best thing about the hotel are the staff. The kindest most helpful and genuine people we have ever met. The animation team.. I'll try my best not to forget anyone.. Dounia SouSoe Zizou Russ Sam Niako Midu Khalid Redouane.. Were like family we felt very sad to leave. No question about returning.. Full marks to everyone.. I can't rate it highly enough,Date of stay: March 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Marbella,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeliciousMarbella

We spent 5 nights here on a family break and absolutely loved it. The hotel is a 25 min drive from the airport and from the minute we arrived we were very impressed!    Facilities within the hotel are superb; a huge outdoor pool and another indoor heated pool gym facilities tennis courts basketball and volleyball courts all available to guests all day long.    The restaurant and food served were excellent with plenty of choices which varied every day!    Whilst the facilities in the hotel were very impressive special mention has to go to the staff. From the moment we arrived all the staff went out of their way to make sure we were made to feel very welcome.

Sol Oasis Marrakech,Holly P wrote a review Mar 2022,50,Stylish and modern hotel,Lovely modern and stylish hotel.  The staff were all extremely helpful and friendly from check in until check out.  We went for the all inclusive option. There was plenty of choice at meal times with freshly cooked options such as omelette. Mohcine and Hicham gave a great service on the bar.  We had a nice dual aspect room with a pleasant view over the garden and pool.  The city shuttle service was really valuable and they ran this for us despite the hotel being quiet.  We’d definitely return again for a relaxing break near Marrakesh centre.,Date of stay: February 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hollyp149

Sol Oasis Marrakech,Abdullah wrote a review Feb 2022,50,Best Holiday Experience,We had a 7 day all inclusive stay at the hotel and it was one of the best holiday experiences we’ve ever had. Marrakech in general was quiet due to covid restrictions so the hotel understandably wasn’t that busy but that didn’t stop the team from making sure we had the most memorable experience.    The food was amazing afternoon lunch was a selection of fresh bbq dishes and mouth watering tagines and evening dinner was again a mix of both traditional Moroccan dishes and other cuisines we were spoilt for choice and often couldn’t decide what to eat.    A special mention goes to Zuzu and Sisou from the kids club both of whom gave so much love and attention to our young daughters that we found it hard to stay away from the hotel lol. It truly felt like we were all a big family and it was just so nice to see the kids having fun.    I cant leave the review without mentioneing Sam and the entire entertainment team from the get go they met all of our needs always making sure we were looked after. Each night we were treated to fun and energetic entertainment from live dance shows which were surprisingly well choreographed to karaoke nights and even a fun spin on bingo.    I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough and we are hoping to book another week in the summer!

Sol Oasis Marrakech,slahkim wrote a review Nov 2021,50,Amazing hotel with the best entertainment team,I can't recommend this hotel enough. We had such an amazing time with my mum my brother and my two young kids.  The hotel is beautiful and the rooms are perfect and large. The hotel is all inclusive and the food is so delicious all the time.  And what makes the hotel so special is that they simply have the best guest relations manager. A huge thank you to the wonderful Arthur who goes well and beyond all the time so lovely so welcoming so helpful. He went twice to the pahramcy to get us medicine and he was just genuinely so kind. By the way I count on you on keeping your lovely moustache :-)    The entertainment team is just the best ever they are so dedicated and so much fun.  We loved playing darts as a family boules coffee games and dancing etc.  Sam is just a gem! Mouss Niako and Mehdi are all so lovely and fun.  The kids club girls were also very kind and my little one loved them.    We can't wait to see you all again. We will be back.    I should also say that the evening shows and animations were all amazing.    I would like to thank you all on behalf of my mum. She probably was the one who needed most this holiday and you didn't disappoint.    One more word for the chef and the waiters who prepared the best meals but also breakfast for me and my kids at 3 am on our departure day.

Sol Oasis Marrakech,nrk2222 wrote a review Nov 2021,50,The best holiday - highly recommend,Everything about this hotel exceeded our expectations. The hotel itself and the rooms are beautifully decorated very clean and had everything we needed for our stay. The hotel is situated outside the centre which we preferred as it was very peaceful but there is also a shuttle that the hotel provides to travel into the city centre (although there was some confusion with organising this on one of the days). Our stay was all-inclusive and there was a wide range of tasty food options for each meal and the chefs and waiters/waitresses are very attentive and friendly - especially the Head Chef as well as Ismail Hachim behind the bar and Noureddine who made us some amazing cocktails.    Aside from the stunning setting and the facilities of the hotel the main thing that made our stay incredible was the friendliness of all of the staff. Everyone is willing to help at all times and they cannot do enough for you. We would particularly like to mention the entertainment team who are some of the loveliest people we have met. In particular we cannot praise Sam enough but the energy of the whole team is just brilliant including Niako Mouss Sousou Russ and everyone else. The effort that they all put into the evening shows was incredible and it is clear how hard everyone works. The decorations and games put together for the Halloween evening were exceptional. Our week was the perfect balance of relaxation and laughter and we thoroughly recommend staying here.
